PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Peachtree City, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1980 Code, as supplemented through May 2, 1996, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron McLaughlin, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 2-1. - Enforcement of ordinances. 
All ordinances passed and ratified by the mayor and city council may be enforced in the same manner as all other ordinances of the city are enforced in municipal court pursuant to article VIII of the Charter. 
(Code 1980, § 2-6) 
Sec. 2-2. - Non-discrimination. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. Throughout this Code, provisions are made for the issuance by the city of various licenses, permits, and approvals. Some are required by federal or state law while others are part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme adopted by this council. The council finds that the number of ever-increasing demands on city staff, resources, and infrastructure is limited, not only by budgetary constraints, but physical limitations and manpower. It is the objective of this council to utilize its resources wisely, fairly, and in the most efficient manner, while requiring consideration of criteria and standards without discrimination or favor. The intent of this article is to recognize and provide guidance for city staff and this council as the city's governing authority to ensure that city services, privileges, and benefits are delivered in a non-discriminatory manner. 
Most all forms of licenses, permits, and approvals required by the city involve some form of deployment of city resources. In order to conserve and allocate these resources wisely, the city often must balance competing factors affecting its citizens, property owners, residents and businesses. Licensing and permitting often requires some form of due process, or notice, and can only be approved following a hearing or other means of allowing citizens to be heard. Adequate advance notice to the pertinent city staff is key to timely and relevant decision-making, as well as a full understanding of material facts and the applicant's objectives. Normally, the burden is on the applicant to apprise the city staff of material information by filing a complete application. 
Fees charged in relation to permits or licenses are established to recoup the city's cost of permit/license review and administration. In certain cases, the fee will also seek to recoup anticipated costs to the city for the burden placed on infrastructure and services, such as additional security and traffic control. The upfront payment of required fees is part of the submission of a complete application. Waiver or reduction of fees and waiver of a complete written application is discouraged, except as incentives for economic development, and should only be approved by the city manager, upon written recommendation of a department manager. 
Last, while it is the general intent of this council to make its permitting and licensing procedures as simplified as possible, the need for fully informed decision-making by city staff and this council mandates the need for consistency and transparency, which are only attainable through a written application process, followed by documented verification and review. In all instances where applications are filed, the city will seek to provide a timely response to the applicant, with all final decisions (approval, denial, or approval upon reasonable conditions) given to the applicant in writing. 
(b)  Non-discrimination. This provision shall apply to all licensing, permitting, and/or approval requests found in this Code. Though certain Code sections may contain objective criteria or standards relevant to the specific license, permit, or approval sought, this provision shall serve as an overlay and guide the decision-making process. 
(1)  No license, permit, or approval shall be denied nor shall the applicant be given less favorable treatment as to time, place, or manner requirements or conditions on account of the race, color, creed, religion, gender, domestic relationship status, familial status, sexual orientation, national origin, political affiliation, or gender identity of the applicant and/or participants in the business, undertaking, event, or activity to be carried out by the applicant under such license, permit, or approval. 
(2)  No license, permit, or approval shall be denied nor shall the applicant be given less favorable treatment as to time, place, or manner requirements or conditions based upon the message or content of speech of the applicant and/or participants in the business, undertaking, event, or activity to be carried out by the applicant under such license, permit, or approval. 
(3)  Where it is assumed or reasonably believed that issuance of a license, permit, or approval is likely to result in unreasonable hostility by opponents of an applicant and/or its group or entity, or there is a heightened risk to public safety, based upon the content of speech or the message conveyed by the applicant and/or participants in the undertaking, event, or activity to be carried out by the applicant under such license, permit, or approval, reasonable accommodation as to time, place, and manner requirements shall be afforded, including provision of city resources necessary for traffic control, and police and fire protection; provided, however, payment for or reimbursement of the cost of such accommodation may be imposed by the city as a reasonable condition for such approval. 
(4)  All other conditions or modifications of the time, place, and manner requirements for a license, permit, or approval shall be reasonable and imposed based upon compelling reasons relating to public safety, health, or the environment. When approval is based upon the imposition of reasonable conditions, all such conditions shall be clearly set forth in the written notice of decision.

Sec. 2-21. - Reserved. 
Sec. 2-22. - Procedure for appointing council members or mayor. 
In the event that city council is authorized to appoint an individual to fill a vacancy on the council, the following procedure shall be followed: 
(1)  Within five days of the occurrence of a vacancy on the city council, the mayor shall declare that a council seat is vacant and shall direct the city clerk to publish a notice in the legal organ of the city that the seat is vacant and that the city will accept applications from all citizens who are legally eligible to hold an elected council position. 
(2)  Applications shall be accepted by the city clerk beginning Monday following the date the notice set forth in subsection (1) is published. Applications shall be accepted for one business week from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday unless such week contains a legal holiday in which case applications shall be accepted on the remaining business days of that week. 
(3)  During the week following the acceptance of the applications on a date and time set by the mayor, the city council shall interview each of the applicants separately in a public meeting, with applicants waiting outside the meeting until their time to interview. The interviews shall consist of an oral presentation of no more than five minutes made by each candidate to the city council and no more than two questions from any single member of the city council to each applicant, with a limit of two minutes per applicant response to each question. 
(4)  After all of the interviews are completed, each member of the city council shall rate the four applicants of whom he or she would like to have as a finalist for the appointment. The council members shall give a rating of "4" to his or her favorite applicant, a "3" to his or her next favorite, and so forth. If there are only three or four applicants, then the city council shall rate only two such applicants. If there are only two applicants, then the city council shall exclude this vote and proceed on to the procedure set forth in subsection (6). 
(5)  The four applicants who receive the highest aggregate points shall be the four finalists. If more than one applicant ties for the fourth highest aggregate points, then all of those applicants who so tied shall also be included as a finalist. If the city council is only selecting two applicants to be finalist as provided in subsection (4), then the same procedure as set forth in this section shall be followed, but for only two finalists as opposed to four. 
(6)  The finalists shall be further interviewed by the city council in a common session. After the interviews are completed, the mayor shall instruct the city council to rank each of the finalists in writing by assigning the number equal to the number of finalists for his or her favorite finalist (e.g., if there are four finalists, then the favorite would receive a ranking of "4"), a ranking of one less than the number of finalists for his or her second favorite (e.g., if there are four finalists, then the second favorite would receive a ranking of "3"), and so forth so that a numerical rating is given to each finalist. The finalist with the highest aggregate score shall be appointed as a council member for the vacant seat. 
(7)  In case there is a tie for the finalist with the highest aggregate score, then the city manager and city attorney will announce that there is a tie. The mayor shall instruct the city council to rank each of the finalists that tied the highest aggregate score in writing by assigning the number equal to the number of tied finalists for his or her favorite finalist (e.g., if there are two finalists that are tied, then the favorite would receive a ranking of "2"), a ranking of one less than the number of finalists for his or her second favorite (e.g., if there are two finalists tied, then the second favorite would receive a ranking of "1"), and so forth so that a numerical rating is given to each finalist. The finalist with the highest aggregate score shall be appointed as a council member for the vacant seat. In the event of a tie for the highest aggregate score, then the procedure set forth above shall continue until two finalists remain. If the procedure is conducted again with only two finalists and a tied result, the mayor will initiate discussion between council members and a subsequent round of voting will be held. In the event of a tie, the city manager and city attorney will consult the round one scores for the tied finalists, and whichever finalist had the higher aggregate score in round one shall be appointed to the vacant seat. In the event of a tie among the same candidates in round one, the mayor shall indicate which of the two tied candidates shall be considered "heads" and the city attorney shall flip a coin to determine the appointment for the vacant position. After a candidate is identified to fill the vacant position, a motion shall be made, seconded, and voted upon to appoint the applicant to the vacant council position. 
(8)  All written votes shall be counted by the city manager and city attorney. 
(9)  All written votes shall contain the name of the voting council member and shall be maintained following the meeting by the city clerk. All written votes are open records.

This compensation is subject to all federal, state and local taxes. 
(c)  The mayor and council members are entitled to reimbursement for all expenses incurred in the exercise of their responsibilities on behalf of the city. The mayor and council members shall follow the procedures established by the city for all city employees for reimbursements. 
(d)  The mayor and council shall be eligible to participate in the city's 457 deferred compensation plan for employees; provided, however, that the city will not match or make any deposits into an account on behalf of the mayor and council members for any deposits or contributions made by the mayor or council members. 
(e)  As part of the budget process, city staff shall conduct a review and comparison of mayor and council salaries with other state municipalities of similar size every four years, beginning in 2010.

Sec. 18-376. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to ensure that residents and businesses in the City of Peachtree City (city) have access to wireless telecommunications networks and state-of-the-art communications services while also ensuring that this objective is achieved in a fashion that considers public safety, preserves the aesthetic character of the community, and is accomplished according to city zoning, planning, and design standards. 
The standards contained in this article are intended to comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 as amended, as well as Section 6409 of the "Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act" (Spectrum Act) of 2012. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 preserved, with certain limitations, local government land use and zoning authority concerning the placement, construction, and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. The city recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to the city and a significant benefit to its residents. The provisions of this article are not intended and shall not be interpreted to have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless services. This article shall not be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. In reviewing any application to provide personal wireless service or to install personal wireless service facilities, the city shall act within the time periods described by this article while taking into account the nature and scope of the application and the required notice and review process where applicable. Any decision to deny an application shall be in writing, supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. 
To accomplish the above-stated objectives and to ensure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities complies with all applicable federal laws, and is consistent with the city's land use and zoning policies, the city is adopting comprehensive regulations pertaining to wireless telecommunications facilities. 
These regulations are designed to meet the following: 
(1)  Promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public by regulating the siting of and establishing development standards for wireless telecommunications facilities and related equipment; 
(2)  Encourage the location of wireless telecommunications facilities within non-residential areas while protecting residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers; 
(3)  Encourage collocation and site sharing of new and existing wireless telecommunications facilities; 
(4)  Facilitate the use of public property for wireless telecommunications facilities; 
(5)  Locate wireless telecommunications facilities in areas where adverse impacts on the community are minimized; 
(6)  Encourage design and construction of wireless telecommunications facilities to harmonize the visual impact of the wireless telecommunications facilities with the existing natural and/or built environment; 
(7)  Enhance the ability of the providers of personal wireless services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; 
(8)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure with engineering and careful siting of tower structures; 
(9)  Enhance and provide emergency respondent capabilities; 
(10)  To establish procedural requirements and substantive criteria applicable to review and approval or denial of applications for a proposed modification to wireless telecommunications facilities; 
(11)  To ensure that application submittal requirements are related to information reasonably necessary to determine if the proposed modification will result in a substantial change in the physical dimensions of the wireless telecommunications facility support structure; 
(12)  To preserve the city's right to continue to enforce and condition approvals in this article in compliance with generally applicable building, structural, electrical, and safety codes and with other laws codifying objective standards reasonably related to health and safety; 
(13)  To promote timely decisions under this article; and 
(14)  To ensure that decisions are made consistently and predictably.

The granting, giving or waiving of any one or more of such consents shall not render unnecessary any subsequent consent or consents. Further, the council can require that its consent to such a transfer or assignment be contingent on conducting negotiations with potential assignees or transferees concerning modification of this franchise agreement if the council reasonably believes that such modification is in the best interests of the city.

Transfer of control of the cable television system which is a pro forma transfer to a parent or a wholly owned subsidiary corporation, or to a partnership with the same general partner as grantee, or hypothecation as the result of a commercial loan, does not require prior notice to and approval by the city. For the purpose of this section, the term "control" is not limited to majority stock ownership, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised.

Parties shall be so excused only for the length of time and to the extent such force majeure prevents either party from abiding by or complying with the terms of the franchise. The grantee shall not be declared in violation or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this article in any case where the action justifying such sanction is without the grantee's knowledge or authorization or outside its control.

(2)  To determine the propriety, legality and mathematical accuracy of a governmental unit's financial transactions; 
(3)  To ascertain whether all financial transactions have been properly recorded; and 
(4)  To ascertain the stewardship of public officials who handle and are responsible for the financial resources of a governmental unit.

(2)  The discharge of firearms is permitted in areas designated by the city council as firing ranges. Such firing range must be designated by means of permit issued by the city council.

State Law reference— Theft of services, O.C.G.A. § 16-8-5. 
Sec. 50-21. - Social hosting. 
(a)  Purpose. The city council desires to protect the health, safety and welfare of all persons living in and visiting the city. The use of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is prohibited by Georgia law and under the Peachtree City Code of Ordinances. This section prohibits and establishes penalties for any person hosting an event or gathering where alcohol is present and being possessed or consumed by persons under 21 years of age. 
(b)  Findings. The city council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The city council finds that: 
(1)  Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement. 
(2)  Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions. Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user. 
(3)  Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present, and condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the alcohol. 
(4)  An ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption. A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs. 
(c)  Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings: 
Alcohol means ethyl alcohol, hydrated oxide of ethyl, or spirits of wine, whiskey, rum, brandy, gin, or any other distilled spirits including dilutions and mixtures thereof from whatever source or by whatever process produced.

Event or gathering means any group of three or more persons who have assembled or gathered together for a social occasion or other activity. 
Host means to aid, conduct, allow, entertain, organize, supervise, control, or permit a gathering or event, whether that host is present or not. 
Parent means any person having legal custody of a juvenile: 
(1)  As natural, adoptive parent, or step-parent; 
(2)  As a legal guardian; or 
(3)  As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the court. 
Person means any individual, partnership, co-partnership, corporation, or any association of one or more individuals.

Alarm system means any single device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal or unauthorized entry or other activity requiring immediate attention and to which the police department will be requested to respond, but does not include alarms installed in motor vehicles, fire alarms, domestic violence alarm, or alarms designed to elicit a medical response. 
Alarm user means any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, governmental or educational entity or any other entity owning or leasing an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection of such premises.

Automatic voice dialer means any electrical, electronic, mechanical, or other device capable of being programmed to send a pre-recorded voice message, when activated, over a telephone line, radio or other communication system, to the emergency communications system requesting police dispatch. 
Cancellation means the process where response is terminated when the alarm company (designated by the alarm user) notifies the emergency communications center that there is not an existing situation at the alarm site requiring police response after an alarm dispatch request. If cancellation occurs prior to the police arriving at the scene, this is not a false alarm for the purpose of civil penalty, and no penalty will be assessed. 
Communications center means Fayette County E911 Communications. 
False alarm means the activation of an alarm system to summon law enforcement personnel which occurs as a result of mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his/her employees or agents, unless the request for response was cancelled by the alarm user or his/her agent before the police arrive at the alarm location. An alarm is false within the meaning of this article when, upon inspection by the police department, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises, which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm, which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by violent conditions of nature, nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the user's alarm company, or designee, to test the system. 
Holdup alarm means a silent alarm signal generated by the manual activation of a device intended to signal a robbery in progress.

Permit year means a 12-month period beginning on the day and month on which an alarm permit is issued to October 1st of the same year. The 12-month period is then effective October 1st to September 30th every year. 
Runaway alarm means an alarm system that produces repeated alarm signals that do not appear to be caused by separate human action. The police department may in its discretion discontinue police responses to alarm signals from what appears to be a runaway alarm. 
SIA Control Panel Standard CP-01 means the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) approved Security Industry Association (SIA) CP-01 Control Panel Standard, as may be updated from time to time, that details recommended design features for security system control panels and their associated arming and disarming devices to reduce false alarms. Control panels built and tested to this standard by nationally recognized testing organizations, will be marked to state: "Design evaluated in accordance with SIA CP-01 Control Panel Standard Features for False Alarm Reduction." 
Verify means an attempt by the monitoring company, or its representative, to contact the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone and/or other electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting the police for dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request.

The permit holder shall complete and return this form to the city within 30 days. The alarm user may mandate that their alarm company obtain the alarm permit, however the alarm user is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the permit is obtained. 
(e)  Multiple alarm systems. If an alarm user has one or more alarm systems protecting two or more separate structures having different addresses and/or tenants, a separate permit shall be required for each structure and/or tenant. 
(Ord. No. 1025, § 3, 5-19-2011)

(5)  An alarm company performing monitoring services shall: 
a.  Attempt to verify, by calling the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone, to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting dispatch. Telephone verification shall require, as a minimum, that a second call be made to a different number, if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify themselves to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid, except in the case of a panic or robbery-in-progress alarm, or in cases where a crime-in-progress has been verified by video and/or audible means.

Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes; 
(2)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. Sec. 41-2-7 et seq. unless such costs are waived by resolution of Fayette County.

(f)  In the event that the hearing officer finds that there has not been a violation of this article and issues an order dismissing the complaint, the hearing officer may also determine if the complaint asserted a claim with respect to which there existed such a complete absence of any justiciable issue of law or fact that it could not be reasonably believed that the hearing officer would accept the asserted complaint. In the event that the hearing officer determines that the complaint was frivolous, unreasonable or groundless, the person who filed the complaint may be required to reimburse the city for the actual costs paid by the city to the hearing officer and for the actual legal costs incurred by the person that the complaint was filed against.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL 

Sec. 66-1. - Purpose. 
The purposes of these sign regulations are: to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to maintain and attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions. This sign ordinance is adopted under the zoning authority of the city in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in the zoning ordinance. 
Specifically, the mayor and city council find that: 
(1)  Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly, and safely designed business environment. 
(2)  An improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public. 
(3)  The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion, and visual clutter, caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs that compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and impede vision of traffic, traffic control signs, and devices. 
(4)  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs may result in a roadside clutter that impedes the flow of information thereby defeating the purpose of signage, and that impedes the flow of information from traffic signs and signals thereby creating hazards to drivers and pedestrians. 
(5)  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of tourism, visitation, and permanent economic growth. 
(6)  Through proper regulation of signs, the attractiveness and economic well being of the city will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business. 
(7)  Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The city council intend by enacting this chapter to: 
a.  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
b.  Further, the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan; 
c.  Protect the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the city; 
d.  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
e.  Maintain the image of the city, particularly the planned community nature of the city; 
f.  Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
g.  Promote economic development; and 
h.  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
(8)  While specifically establishing regulations to control signs within the city, it is not the intent of this chapter to regulate: 
a.  Art and art symbols; 
b.  Holiday decorations and symbols. 
(9)  Recognizing the need for certain types of signs which facilitate the safe and orderly movement of traffic, this chapter provides for the regulation of incidental address identification and subdivision identification signs. 
(10)  Recognizing the need to facilitate decreases in crime this chapter provides for the regulation of burglar alarm/security signs. 
(11)  Recognizing the historical contribution of certain structures and places to the cultural fabric of the city and the need and desire to identify same, certain provisions are made in this chapter to allow for the identification of those structures and places. 
(12)  While this chapter prohibits certain signs from placement within the city and exempts certain signs from certain regulations of this chapter, such exemptions are not intended to otherwise allow a sign that is prohibited. 
(13)  Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and the sustained stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings, and other structures throughout the city. 
(14)  Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city hereby imposes the regulations contained in this chapter.

No permit shall be required to repaint or change the lettering of an existing conforming sign, provided that no change of ownership of the entity displaying the message thereon has been made. A permit is not required for a change limited solely to the copy of an existing changeable copy sign, for example, a change in the normal price or products offered on the premises. 
(b)  A sign permit application and appropriate application fee must be submitted for each sign being considered for approval. A separate sign permit application and associated fee must be submitted for each type of sign located on a project site (i.e., one permit for all monument signs, one permit for wall signs, one permit for directional signs, etc.). 
Applications for permits shall be made upon forms provided by the city and shall contain or have attached thereto the following information: 
(1)  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant. 
(2)  Address of building, structure, or lot to which or upon which the sign is to be attached or erected. 
(3)  One accurate drawing showing the position of the sign in relation to nearby buildings or structures, including other signs, driveways, parking areas, and any other limiting site features. 
(4)  One accurate drawing of the plans, specifications and method of construction and attachment of the sign to the building or ground. Such drawings shall include the size of the sign area, overall height of the sign, location of the sign installation and its relation to existing rights-of-way and all driveways, and, if a monument sign, any protective devices or landscaping around the base of the sign. 
(5)  Name, address and telephone numbers of person erecting the sign. 
(6)  Written consent of the owner, manager, leasing agent or lessee of the building or land to which or upon which the sign is to be erected. 
(7)  The location and size of all other signs on the lot upon which the sign is to be erected. 
(8)  The size of the lot on which the sign is to be erected and the length of the street frontage for the street to which the sign is oriented; or, if a wall sign, the overall length of the tenant space where the sign will be located. 
(9)  If the sign is to be lighted, an application for electrical permit meeting all standards of the city's electrical code. 
(10)  Such other information as the city shall require to show full compliance with this and other ordinances of the city. 
(c)  For signs shared by more than one person or entity, the owner or sign contractor shall secure a permit for the sign structure and the owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the structure as well as for removal of individual sign panels identifying uses which no longer exist within the building or buildings covered by the shared sign. In addition to the permit required for a shared sign structure, a separate permit shall be required for each panel, which shall be obtained by the owner, his tenant, an authorized agent, or the sign contractor. 
(d)  Fees for permits shall be as fixed from time to time by the city council. 
(e)  Upon the filing of an application for a permit and the payment of all necessary fees, the city planner shall examine all plans and specifications submitted and the premises upon which the sign is proposed to be erected. Such review shall be completed within 30 days of submission of a completed sign application. If it appears from review of the permit application and the site that the proposed sign is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter and all other ordinances and laws of the city, the city planner shall issue a permit no later than 30 days from receipt of the completed application. 
(f)  For those signs containing electrical components, the applicant must secure appropriate electrical permits from the city's building department and call for an inspection prior to illuminating the sign. 
(g)  Denial of permit. The city shall deny permits to applicants who submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this chapter, are incomplete, or contain any false material statements. The city may deny permits for master sign programs, or amendments to master sign programs, based upon the architectural appearance of the program; such review, however, shall not include the content of the message(s) conveyed in the master sign program. Violation of any provision of this chapter will be grounds for terminating a permit granted by the city for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this chapter, the city planner shall revoke the permit. Should the city planner deny a permit, the reasons for denial shall be stated in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application on or before 30 days after the city received the application. Alternatively, the city may personally serve the sign applicant with a copy of the written notice of denial within 30 days after the city's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, instead of the date of the original submission. 
No permit shall be denied or revoked, except for due cause as hereinafter defined, and after the applicant is given ten days written notice containing a statement of the reasons for the proposed denial of the permit application or the revocation of a permit. "Due cause" is the violation of any provision of this chapter, or other applicable ordinances, state or federal law, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing false material statements. 
(h)  Appeals. An individual whose permit application has been denied or a permittee whose permit has been revoked may appeal the decision to the city council, provided such appellant files a written notice of appeal with the city clerk within ten business days of the city planner's notice. Such appeal shall be considered by the city council at the next city council meeting held after the city's receipt of the written notice of appeal, provided that such notice of appeal is received a minimum of five business days before the next meeting. Appeal notices received within five days of a scheduled city council meeting shall be heard at the next available meeting more than five days following receipt of appeal. The city council shall issue a written decision to the applicant no later than 30 days following the close of the appeal hearing. Decisions of the city council to affirm the decision of the city planner or to overrule the decision of the city planner and grant or continue the permit for which appeal is taken shall be reduced to writing and served upon the applicant in the same manner as the original notice to deny or notice of revocation. Such decision shall constitute a final determination by the city. 
In the event an applicant whose permit has been denied or a permit holder whose permit has been revoked is dissatisfied with the decision of the city council, such applicant or permit holder may appeal such decision via a petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court as provided by law. 
(i)  Variances. Each sign shall comply with the provisions of the ordinance, unless a written request is filed and approved to waive this requirement. All variance procedures shall be held in strict conformance with the procedures for variances as set forth in Article XIII, Section 1302 of the city's zoning ordinance. 
Variances from the regulations of this chapter shall be limited to the following hardship situations: 
(1)  Where the proximity of existing signs on adjoining lots causes the subject property to be ineligible, due to spacing requirements, for a sign of the type sought; or 
(2)  Where visibility of a conforming sign from the proposed street and within 50 feet of the proposed sign would be substantially impaired by existing trees, plants, natural features, signs, buildings or structures on a different lot; and 
(3)  Placement of the sign elsewhere on the lot would not remedy the visual obstruction; 
(4)  Such visibility obstruction was not created by the owner of the subject property; and 
(5)  The variance proposed would not create a safety hazard to vehicular traffic or pedestrians as determined by the city engineer. 
Variances shall be limited to the minimum relief necessary to overcome the hardship. No variances shall be granted to allow a greater number of signs than would be allowed if the hardship did not exist. 
Relief from the application of the provisions of this chapter by use of variances granted by the city council shall be granted only upon a finding of hardship as previously defined. Hearing on such variances shall be noticed using this same time frames and notice requirements as for variances from zoning decisions. 
(j)  Double permit fees. Any person commencing work on a sign before securing the necessary permit from the city planner shall be subject to double permit fees under the permit fee schedule. 
(Ord. No. 891, § 1, 10-5-2006) 
Sec. 66-8. - Expiration of sign permit. 
A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been completed and installed within three months after the date the permit was issued. No refunds will be made of permit fees for permits that expire due to failure to erect a permitted sign; provided that where an applicant can demonstrate that a commercial entity was timely engaged to construct the permitted sign but the fabrication has not yet been completed, one 90-day extension may be granted by the city planner on the duration of the permit. Where a permit has expired for failure to erect the sign, if an individual later desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule in effect at the time of resubmission. 
(Ord. No. 891, § 1, 10-5-2006) 
Sec. 66-9. - Display of permit. 
The owner of the sign shall be responsible for maintaining the permit for every sign approved, erected or maintained for which a permit is required by this chapter. The city planner shall inspect each sign following its installation to ensure the sign is installed in accordance with the approved sign permit. Once it is determined the sign complies with said permit, a decal shall be affixed to the actual sign or to the entrance door of the place of business indicating the sign has been approved. The purpose of this decal shall be to notify city officers and employees that the sign complies with the provisions of this chapter and the approved sign permit application. 
(Ord. No. 891, § 1, 10-5-2006) 
Sec. 66-10. - Compliance with technical codes and zoning. 
All signs hereafter erected, replaced, reconstructed, altered, relocated or modified within the city shall conform with the requirements of the city's building code in effect on the date the application for a sign permit is submitted, the requirements of the National Electrical Code, and the requirements of all other applicable codes as adopted by the city. Where the provisions of the building or electrical code and this chapter conflict or overlap, the most stringent requirement shall prevail and be controlling. 
All signs hereafter erected, replaced, reconstructed, repaired, altered or relocated within the city shall conform to the zoning ordinance of the city. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and the zoning ordinance, the most stringent requirement shall prevail and be controlling.

Sec. 66-16. - Computation of sign area. 
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area for monument and wall signs: 
(1)  Monument signs. The area of a monument sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of the surface of a sign whereon the sign face or sign face modules may be placed, including all portions of a sign structure that provide a background for the sign face and are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature. 
The supports or structure upon which the sign face is located shall not be included in determining the overall size of the monument sign unless they are designed in a manner to form an integral part of the display and the surface area of the frame that is parallel to the display is no greater than 100 percent of the area of the sign displayed, and provided that no part of the monument sign is higher than five feet. 
Double-sided signs with parallel, opposing faces shall not exceed 18 inches in width as measured from sign face to sign face. Only one face of a double-faced sign and bearing identical copy shall be used to compute the overall sign area. 
(2)  Wall signs. The area of a wall sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of the surface of a sign whereon the sign face or sign face modules may be placed, including all portions of a sign structure that provide a background for the sign face and are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature. Any open space contained within the limits of the rectangle delimiting the sign face, sign face module, or sign structure shall be included in the computation of the area of such sign face, sign face module, or sign structure. 
(3)  Computation of sign height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: 
a.  Existing grade prior to construction, or 
b.  The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. 
In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoned lot, whichever is lower. 
The maximum height of monument signs shall be no greater than five feet.

ARTICLE V. - ENFORCEMENT AND SIGN REMOVAL PROCEDURES 

Sec. 66-23. - Inspection. 
The city planner or code enforcement officer or other designated city officials shall periodically inspect each permanent and temporary conforming and non-conforming sign for the purpose of ascertaining whether the same is secure or insecure, whether it is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter and whether it is in need of repair. 
In addition to these inspections, the city planner or code enforcement officer shall cause to be removed any sign that falls under the following classifications: 
(1)  Traffic hazards. Any sign constituting a traffic hazard or a menace to the motoring public or pedestrians, as determined by the city planner or code enforcement officer in consultation with the chief of police, shall be removed as provided herein. 
(2)  General maintenance. Every sign, including those signs for which permits are required and those for which no permits or permit fees are required shall be maintained in a safe, presentable and good structural condition at all times. The sign owner shall be responsible for repair or replacement of defective parts, painting, repainting, cleaning and other acts required for the maintenance of the sign. If the sign is not made to comply with adequate safety and maintenance standards, the city planner or code enforcement officer shall require its removal in accordance herein. 
(3)  Abandoned signs. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any sign that is located on property that becomes vacant and unoccupied for a period of one month or longer, including any tenant in a multi-tenant commercial, office, or industrial structure, or any sign which pertains to a time, event or purpose which no longer applies, shall be deemed to have been abandoned. Permanent signs applicable to a business temporarily suspended because of a change of ownership or management of such business shall not be deemed abandoned unless the property remains vacant for a period of six months or more. Sign panels from abandoned signs shall be removed by the owner of the premises on which the sign is located within the time frame specified in this Subsection. The supporting structure of an abandoned sign shall be subject to the non-conforming use provisions herein. 
(4)  Dangerous or defective signs. No person shall maintain or permit to be maintained on any premises owned or controlled by that person any sign that is in a dangerous or defective condition. Any such sign shall be removed or repaired by the owner of the premises or owner of the sign. Upon failure of the owner to remove or repair a dangerous or defective sign, the city planner or code enforcement officer shall proceed as described herein. 
(5)  Unlawful signs. No person shall erect or permit to be erected any sign that does not comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
The city planner or code enforcement officer shall prepare a written notice that shall describe the sign and specify the violation involved. The notice shall state that if the sign is not removed or the violation is not corrected within ten business days, the sign shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
All notices by the city planner or code enforcement officer shall be personally served or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. Any time periods provided in this section shall be deemed to commence on the date received if hand delivered or otherwise on the date delivered as shown upon the return receipt of the U.S. Postal Service. 
The notice shall be mailed to the owner of the property on which the sign is located, the owner of the sign, and the occupant of the property. If any such person is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be mailed to such person's last known address, if any, and posted on the sign or on the premises. 
Any person having an interest in the sign or the property may appeal the determination of the city planner or code enforcement officer ordering removal or compliance by filing a written notice of appeal with the city council within ten business days after receipt of the notice. Appeals will be handled as provided in section 66-7. 
If the person to whom notice is directed fails to take corrective action within the time period prescribed, or if on appeal the city council affirms the decision of the city planner or code enforcement officer and the person fails to take corrective action or remove the offending sign within the time period prescribed, then the city planner or code enforcement officer shall proceed to have the sign removed or corrected to bring such sign into compliance with this chapter or to remove any unsafe condition. 
When it is determined by the city planner or code enforcement officer that the sign would cause imminent danger to the public safety and contact cannot be made with the sign order or building owner, no written notice shall have to be served prior to removal. In such emergency situation, the city planner or code enforcement officer shall document the unsafe condition and may correct the danger, with all costs being charged to the sign owner or the property owner. 
If it shall be necessary for the city planner or code enforcement officer to remove the sign pursuant to the provisions of this section, and it should be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the removal, the city planner or code enforcement officer may sell or salvage any material derived in the removal. He may sell the same at public or private sale at the best price obtainable and keep an account of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be use to offset the cost of removal to be charged to the sign owner or property owner. Any proceeds in excess of the cost of removal shall be returned to the sign owner, if known or if unknown, shall be deposited in the city treasury and maintained for benefit of the owner for a period of three years. At the end of three years, all unclaimed proceeds shall become the property the city. Where the proceeds derived from such sale are less than the costs of removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located. Such lien shall be collectable in the same manner as city property taxes. 
Any sign removed by the city planner or code enforcement officer pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The cost of removal of the sign by the city shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recoverable in the same manner as city property taxes. The cost of removable shall include any and all incidental expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sign removal.

Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, fees for special services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, system development charges and special assessments. 
(b)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities. 
(Ord. No. 871, § 1, 2-2-2006) 
Sec. 82-105. - Stormwater user fee charge rates. 
(a)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the city council. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, and together with other sources of support available to the city stormwater utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
(1)  Detached single family residential (DSFR) customer class. Detached single family residential properties have been segregated into three separate tiers for billing based on a representative statistical analysis of impervious surface area located on the various DSFR properties. 
a.  Tier 1 DSFR: The charges shall be equal to 0.68 ERU = 3,128 square feet, billed as a flat rate. 
b.  Tier 2 DSFR: The charges shall be equal to 1.0 ERU = 4,600 square feet, billed as a flat rate. 
c.  Tier 3 DSFR: The charges shall be equal to 1.52 ERU = 6,992 square feet, billed as a flat rate. 
(2)  Attached residential (AR) customer class. Attached single family residential properties have been segregated into two separate tiers for billing based on a representative statistical analysis of impervious surface area located on the various AR properties and/or whether or not the development has public or private roads/streets. 
a.  AR with public roads: The charges shall be equal to 0.47 ERU = 2,162 square feet, billed as a flat rate. 
b.  AR with private roads: The charges shall be equal to the total impervious surface area of the development divided by the ERU (4,600 square feet) and apportioned equally among the dwelling units within the development. 
(3)  Non-single family residential (NSFR) customer class. NSFR properties shall be billed one ERU for each 4,600 square feet, or portion thereof, of impervious surfaces located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs for NSFR properties will be rounded to two decimal places to establish the actual number of ERUs for billing. If a NSFR property has less than 1.00 ERU, then the customer will be billed a minimum of 1.00 ERU. 
(b)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be applied to customers as follows: 
(1)  The DSFR stormwater user fee flat rate charge shall be as follows: 
a.  Tier 1 DSFR customers: $4.69 per month. 
b.  Tier 2 DSFR customers: $6.89 per month. 
c.  Tier 3 DSFR customers: $10.47 per month. 
d.  All DSFR customers shall be billed periodically for stormwater services on a schedule established by the city council. 
e.  For those DSFR customers which live within subdivisions that are serviced by private roads, a prorated share of the total impervious surface area associated with the private road shall be added as a surcharge to the bill for those properties of the subdivision that are serviced by the private road. This will be accomplished by dividing the total impervious area of the private roads in the subdivision by the ERU (4,600 square feet) and then equally dividing the ERUs among the dwelling units in the subdivision. The charge for the surcharge shall be added to the monthly bill amount by multiplying the prorated share of the ERUs by a rate of $6.89 per ERU. 
(2)  The AR stormwater user fee charge shall be as follows: 
a.  AR with public roads: $3.22 flat rate per month per unit. These customers shall be billed periodically for stormwater services on a schedule established by the city council. 
b.  AR with private roads: The charges shall be equal to the total impervious surface area of the development divided by the ERU (4,600 square feet) times a rate of $6.89 per ERU per month and apportioned equally among the dwelling units. These customers shall be billed periodically for stormwater services on a schedule established by the city council. 
(3)  The NSFR stormwater user charge for each ERU, or fractional ERU, shall be as follows: 
a.  $6.89 per ERU (4,600 square feet) per month. 
b.  All NSFR customers shall be billed periodically for stormwater services on a schedule established by the city council. 
(4)  A surcharge shall be added to all bills for impervious surfaces associated with streets, cart paths, public buildings and other public facilities for which the city maintains ownership or maintenance responsibility. This surcharge will serve as payment for those impervious surfaces in-lieu of a payment from the city's general fund as collected through property taxes, sales taxes, and other sources, provided that the imposition of this surcharge shall in no manner restrict the city, at the discretion of the city council, from using monies from the city's general fund or from other sources to pay expenses of the city stormwater utility. 
a.  The surcharge for public properties shall be calculated by dividing the total impervious area associated with city properties by the ERU (4,600 square feet) and then equally dividing the ERUs the total ERUs associated with all non-city ERUs. The charge shall be calculated by multiplying the prorated ERUs by a charge of $6.89 per ERU. 
b.  The surcharge shall be as follows: 
1.  Tier 1 DSFR customers: 0.25 ERUs. 
2.  Tier 2 DSFR customers: 0.36 ERUs. 
3.  Tier 3 DSFR customers: 0.55 ERUs. 
4.  AR with Public Roads customers: 0.17 ERUs. 
5.  AR with Private Roads: 0.36 ERUs per assessed ERU. 
6.  NSFR customers: 0.36 ERUs per assessed ERU.

Sec. 82-108. - Enforcement methods and inspections. 
(a)  All property owners of improved property within the incorporated areas of the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the city municipal court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the penalties set forth in section 1-11 of this Code. 
(b)  Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater manager, the city may elect to sue in the city municipal court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the city municipal court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the city municipal court. 
(c)  The city shall have the right for its designated officers and employees to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law. Such inspections shall generally be limited to the following purposes: 
(1)  Inspecting or conducting engineering analyses on existing stormwater management systems and facilities located on-site; or 
(2)  Determining that stormwater management systems and facilities need to be constructed. 
(Ord. No. 871, § 1, 2-2-2006) 
Sec. 82-109. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments. 
Failure to receive a stormwater utility bill is not justification for non-payment. The property owner, as identified from public land records of Fayette County, shall be obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property. 
(1)  Billing. 
a.  Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue April 1, 2006, and shall be billed prospectively. The initial billing cycle will be April 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater user fee charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due. 
b.  The stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected as deemed most effective and efficient by the city council. 
c.  Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by the city council. 
d.  Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each developed property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments. 
e.  If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of improved property, the city stormwater utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period. 
(2)  Delinquencies and collection. 
a.  Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner and/or the property. 
b.  A late charge shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility user fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner. 
(3)  Adjustments. The stormwater manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge. 
a.  If a customer believes their stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek and adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property within 60 days of the mailing of such bill to the customer by the city. After such 60-day period, the stormwater bill shall be final and no adjustment may be sought by the customer until the issuance of the next stormwater bill by the city. Any such request shall be submitted in writing to the stormwater manager and shall set forth in detail the grounds upon which the adjustment is sought. 
b.  Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information to the stormwater manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request. 
c.  Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater manager, the stormwater manager shall have 30 calendar days within which to render a written decision. Concurrent payment of any charges allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to this request for review. 
d.  In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater utility user fee charge for the property is correct. 
e.  The stormwater manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
f.  If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater bill for an amount not to exceed the equivalent of one-year's charges at current rates for that property regardless of whether credits apply to the property. If the result of the adjustment is that the bill will be increased, then the city shall apply the new billing rate on the next billing cycle. 
g.  No adjustments shall be made to any bill upon the expiration of 60 days after the date that such bill is mailed by the city to the customer, it being the intention of this section to establish such limitation period of 60 days upon the customers to seek an adjustment of their stormwater charge. 
(Ord. No. 871, § 1, 2-2-2006; Ord. No. 1057, § 1, 2-7-2013) 
Sec. 82-110. - Appeals, hearings. 
(a)  Appeals. An appeal to the city manager may be taken by any property owner or customer aggrieved by any decision of the stormwater manager. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days of the decision of the stormwater manager by filing with the city manager a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the stormwater manager shall forthwith transmit to the city manager all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken. 
(b)  Hearing. The city manager shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall indicate the place, date and time of the hearing. The city manager shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the stormwater manager after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the stormwater manager is reversed in whole or in part, resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal. 
(c)  The decision of the city manager shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the city manager may appeal that decision to the superior court of Fayette county by writ of certiorari.

Sec. 703. - Interpretation of district boundaries. 
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the district boundaries as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(703.1) District boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines or right-of-way lines of streets, highways, railways, or utility easements shall be construed to follow such centerlines or right-of-way lines. 
(703.2) District boundaries indicated as approximately following lot or tract lines, whether public or private, shall be construed to follow such lines. 
(703.3) District boundaries indicated as approximately following incorporated area lines, county limit lines, land lot lines, militia district lines, or special district lines, as amended from time to time, shall be construed to follow such lines. 
(703.4) District boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines, right-of-way lines, or shorelines of creeks, streams, channels, canals, or other waterways shall be construed to follow such centerlines, right-of-way lines, or shorelines. 
(703.5) District boundaries indicated as being approximately parallel to, or extensions of, features or lines listed in subsections (703.1), (703.2), (703.3) and (703.4), above, shall be so construed. 
(703.6) Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined according to the scale of the map. 
Sec. 704. - Annexation. 
These regulations are designed to set forth the principles which shall apply to annexation of property into the city limits of the city. The following principles shall apply: 
(a)  Support and enhance the existing economic value and environmental control of property within the city limits. 
(b)  Primary consideration will be given to complementary zoning within the current land use plan of the city and contiguous jurisdictions. 
(704.1) Priority will be given to raw land that can be developed consistent with current city standards. Secondary considerations will be given to harmoniously adjacent developed parcels. 
(704.2) The city shall provide written notification to the appropriate governmental jurisdiction as soon as practicable following the initiation of any annexation. 
(704.3) It is desirable, but not essential, that all property have natural boundaries, but in no instance create unnatural division for convenience sake. 
(704.4) Each of the following factors will be reviewed on each area to be annexed according to economic and service feasibility on its own merit within the framework of existing plan for the entire city: 
a.  Water/sewer; 
b.  Road/street access; 
c.  Police/fire protection; 
d.  Zoning compliance. 
(704.5) Whenever the owner of a piece of property outside the city limits and/or the city council, planning commission and the planning and zoning department wishes to request that certain property be annexed into the city limits of Peachtree City, such person or their designated agent shall follow a two-step review process as adopted by city council at their meeting on August 5, 2004 (or as amended by city council) and formally identified as the "Annexation Review Process." A copy of this document is kept on record at city hall and is available from the planning and zoning department. 
The first step of this process is intended to provide a general overview of the proposed annexation and identifies how the annexation may or may not be compatible with the established goals within the city's comprehensive plan. This information will be reviewed by city staff and other governmental agencies and will then be forwarded to city council for review. 
Should city council recommend that the proposed annexation request continue through the established review process, step two of this process requires the submittal of additional and detailed information pertaining to the impacts of the proposed annexation and subsequent development. The recommendation that the annexation request continue through the review process in no way implies that the city council will ultimately approve the property for annexation. 
Until such time that the city council votes to accept an application for annexation, city staff shall not take any action or make any recommendations with respect to such application that is submitted by a property owner or their designated agent. This restriction shall not apply to an application for annexation that is initiated by city council, the planning commission and/or the planning and zoning department. 
If the application for annexation is rejected by city council, no further action will be taken by the city regarding such application. 
(704.6) A property owner may not apply for annexation of the same parcel more often than once every six months; provided that a property owner, with the consent of the city council, may voluntarily withdraw the annexation application once prior to the time same is acted upon by the city council, and the six-month waiting period shall not apply to a subsequent annexation application for the same parcel; the "same parcel" is one which includes any portion of a parcel for which a annexation application has been submitted previously; and 
(704.7) If an applicant [application] for annexation is denied by action of the city council, then the same property may not again be reconsidered for annexation until the expiration of at least six months immediately following said denial. 
(704.8) If step one of an application for annexation is approved by the city council, the applicant shall submit all required information for step two of the process within one year of the approval of step one of the process. If such information is not submitted within such one year period, the approval of step one of the process will expire unless such period is extended by the city council. The applicant may request one extension of the step one approval for a period not to exceed six months.

Sec. 705. - Additions or reductions in total land area. 
Where the total land area in the city is increased or reduced by virtue of annexation or some other means, the zoning district boundaries shall be adjusted in the following fashion: 
(705.1) When increases are made in the land area of the city, the added land shall be classified AR-agricultural reserve unless the city council makes provision for another zoning classification in accordance with the procedures set forth in this ordinance. 
(705.2) When reductions are made in the city land area, the provisions of this ordinance shall no longer apply to that land area involved in the reduction. 
(705.3) In all cases where additions or reductions to the city's total land area require adjustments in the zoning district boundaries, said adjustments shall be made immediately on the official zoning map.

(913.3) Visibility: At any street intersection or at the intersection of any private driveway with a street, no fence, wall, sign, planting, or other structure or object shall be permitted or maintained that will form an impediment to visibility within 25 feet of the point of intersection of the driving surfaces (or such lines extended in the case of rounded corners). 
Sec. 914. - Exceptions to height limits. 
The height limitations of this ordinance shall not apply to chimneys, spires, silos, flagpoles, towers and such other structures not intended for human occupancy, provided such structure or portion of a structure will not interfere with any established airport approach zones or flight patterns. 
Sec. 915. - Easements. 
No permanent structures or improvements shall be placed on any officially designated and recorded easement area. 
Sec. 916. - Transition yard standards between dissimilar zoning districts. 
The preservation and promotion of nature is a desirable and important means of protecting the public health, safety and welfare and that a healthy environment indicates a healthy community, which is consistent with the city's comprehensive plan. The use of setback and buffers is a method of preserving and enhancing nature, while providing citizens an assurance of protection from negative intrusions such as visual and noise impacts from uses on adjoining developments. More specifically, this section is intended to provide requirements that will ensure greater compatibility between different characters of land uses by requiring a transition yard between the uses in order to minimize the harmful impact of noise, dust and other debris, motor vehicles headlight glare or other artificial light intrusion and other objectionable activities or impacts conducted on or created by an adjoining or nearby use. This section will provide consideration of those physical and visual elements of a development or use and to require treatment of the land with landscaping using plant materials and/or manmade features. Such plant materials and/or manmade features are to be arranged to enhance the appearance, to screen or effectively separate different types of uses, and to eliminate or minimize impacts on adjoining uses. 
For the purposes of this ordinance, transition yards shall be established as follows: 
(916.1) Establishment of transition yard. Within each zoning district, minimum building and parking setbacks have been established to separate development from the property line. These setbacks are not meant to be "build to" lines but to simply define the area in which structures and other development may occur. The city recognizes the importance of separating property zoned GC, LUC, OI, LI or GI from residentially zoned property. In those areas, the setback requirements shall be increased, such that a natural buffer shall be provided between dissimilar zoning districts. This buffer shall be referred to as a transition yard on the conceptual and final site plan submittal. Absolutely no unapproved clearing and/or grading, except for perpendicular utility crossings, shall be permitted within the transition yard unless prior written approval is granted by the city for the removal of infected, infested, and/or damaged trees that pose a threat to human life and/or property as determined by the planning and development director. Stormwater detention and/or water quality features shall not be located within the transition yard. 
(916.2) Property abutting residentially-zoned property. Notwithstanding any provision of this ordinance to the contrary, all property zoned GC, LUC, OI, LI or GI that adjoins a residentially zoned tract of land shall have increased setback and buffer requirements along any rear and/or side property lines abutting the residential property. At a minimum, the setback and buffer requirements shall be no less than 75 feet in width as measured from the property boundary. 
(916.3) Property separated from residentially-zoned property by greenbelt. On those tracts of land zoned GC, LUC, OI, LI or GI that are separated from residential property by a greenbelt of less than 75 feet in width, the setback and buffer requirements along these adjoining property lines shall increase such that there is no less than a 75 feet undisturbed buffer, as identified above, separating rear and/or side property lines abutting the greenbelt/residential property. On those tracts of land zoned GC, LUC, OI, LI or GI that are separated from residential property by a greenbelt of 75 feet or greater in width, the setback and buffer requirements along these adjoining property lines shall not need to be increased. 
(916.4) Transition yard/landscaping requirements. Landscaping within the established transition yard shall, at maturity, be no less than ten feet in height and/or a height that will provide intervening vegetation to the full height of the proposed use structure as viewed from the eye level elevation of five feet six inches at any point along the abutting use setback line and/or the second story of a residential use. In those instances where a greenbelt exists and is used to reduce the size of the required transition yard, the greenbelt shall be enhanced as applicable to meet the requirements of this paragraph. 
Where applicable, the following landscaping elements shall be utilized to meet these guidelines: 
(a)  Meandering berms at a minimum of four feet in height with 4:1 slopes and a crown of no less than width of four feet. 
(b)  The top of the berm shall include a six-foot tall stockade-type privacy fence, which is painted or stained a neutral color. 
(c)  At the base and on both sides of the fence, evergreen vines (Confederate Jasmine, Boston ivy, etc.) shall be planted at no more than four feet on center and be trained to cover the fence. 
(d)  The slopes of the berm shall be planted with a combination of evergreen plant material (Leyland Cypress, Cryptomeria Japonica, etc.) planted in staggered rows at eight feet on center. The minimum height of the evergreen plant material shall be no less than six to eight feet in height from finish grade to the top of the plant material at the time of planting. 
(e)  All exposed areas on the berm shall be mulched with no less than four inches of fresh hardwood bark mulch. 
(f)  A drip irrigation system shall be installed and utilized to irrigate all plant material for no less than 12 months from date of installation and acceptance by the city. 
(g)  The berm, fence and landscaping shall be installed once the site is cleared and graded and prior to issuance of a building permit.

Exhibit "A" 

(Ord. No. 1111(OI), § 1, 5-5-2016) 
Sec. 1006. - GC general commercial district. 
(1006.1) Intent of district: It is intended that the GC zoning district be established and reserved for general business purposes. The regulations that apply within this district are designed to encourage the formation and continuance of a stable, economically healthy and compatible environment for businesses to serve city and regional commercial needs. These regulations are also intended to accommodate businesses which benefit from being located in close proximity to each other, and to discourage any encroachment by other uses capable of adversely affecting the basic commercial character of the district. It is further intended that these regulations will reduce traffic congestion, provide for adequate off-street parking, and limit the development of "strip" type business areas. 
The city council does hereby find that, based upon studies conducted on behalf of the city and by other cities, big box developments, typically over 32,000 square feet for an individual business, and developments with over 150,000 square feet of retail space, can have negative impacts on a community. In particular, such developments can have a negative impact on the scale of retail development in the community, and can also adversely impact existing retail businesses in the city. Additionally, such developments can result in an over-supply of commercial development within the city, thereby shifting the economic focus of the community. Employment opportunities may also be adversely affected by such developments. Finally, such developments are contrary to the city's comprehensive plan, as well as the goals and objectives of providing public safety services to the city's residents. For the foregoing reasons, the city council has determined it to be in the best interests of the city to provide that such developments may only be established pursuant to a special use permit, subject to the terms and conditions for the application and approval thereof set for in this section. 
(1006.2) Permitted uses: The following uses shall be permitted in any GC zoning district:

(1006.4) Special Use Permit: Certain uses, because of their unique characteristics or potential impacts on adjacent land uses, are not generally permitted within the GC zoning district as a matter of right, but may, under the right set of circumstances and conditions be acceptable in certain specific locations.

No inherent right exists to receive a special use permit; such permits are a special privilege granted by the city under a specific set of circumstances and conditions, and each application and situation is unique. Consequently, mere compliance with the generally applicable requirements may not be sufficient and additional measures, occasionally substantial, may be necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed development. In other situations, no set of conditions would be sufficient to approve an application, even though the same request in another location might be approved. 
1006.4(a) Applicability: The following uses may be permitted within the GC zoning district following issuance of a special use permit by city council: 
(a)  Commercial and/or retail developments with more than 150,000 square feet of general commercial uses.

1006.4(d) Review procedures. Application for the establishment of special uses shall be submitted to the city planner and, upon determination that such application contains all necessary elements, shall be deemed received by the city and referred to the planning commission for its review and recommendation. 
The planning commission shall report to the mayor and city council its recommendation as to the approval or disapproval of such application and any recommendation for establishment of conditions, in addition to those set forth in this article, deemed necessary to protect the public interest and welfare. 
In considering applications for special use permits, the planning commission and city council shall use the standards set forth in section 1305 of this appendix and shall consider the following criteria: 
(a)  Compatibility of the proposed use and location with the policies established in the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Compatibility of the proposed use with the character of adjacent properties and the surrounding neighborhoods and with existing and proposed development. 
(c)  Availability of, or ability to provide, adequate utilities, drainage, parking and loading space, lighting, screening, landscaping and open space. 
(d)  Provision of safe and convenient vehicular, pedestrian, bicycle, and alternate modes of transportation. 
(e)  Compatibility of the proposed use with the intent and function of the GC zoning district. 
(f)  Compliance with applicable performance standards and requirements as set forth in the city's land development ordinance. 
In approving any application for special use permit, the city may by resolution: 
(a)  Impose such reasonable standards, conditions or requirements, in addition to any specified within this chapter, as it may deem necessary to protect the public interest and welfare. Such additional standards may include, but are not limited to, special setbacks, buffer requirements, increased screening or landscaping requirements, and standards pertaining to traffic, circulation, noise, lighting, hours of operation and similar characteristics. 
(b)  Require that a performance guarantee, acceptable in form, content and amount to the city be posted by the applicant to ensure continued compliance with all conditions and requirements that may be specified. 
(c)  Specify time limits or expiration dates for any such special use permits, including provisions for periodic review and renewal. 
1006.4(e) Procedures applicable to permits. Unless otherwise specified by the conditions of the permit, failure to establish the special use authorized by the permit within two years from the date of approval by the city council shall cause the permit to terminate automatically. In the case of uses involving the construction of new buildings or other structures, the use shall be deemed "established" if all necessary foundation work has been completed within the two-year period and construction work is continuously and diligently pursued thereafter under a valid building permit. In the case of uses involving occupancy of land or an existing building, the use shall be deemed "established" only if the land or buildings have been occupied and the proposed activity conducted within the two-year period. 
Unless otherwise specified in the conditions of a permit, the initial term of each special use permit shall be for one year from the date of approval. Upon compliance with those conditions and restrictions imposed by the city council and all relevant city ordinances, the special use permit shall, without application, be renewed automatically for additional successive one-year terms. However, a special use permit shall not be so renewed and shall expire at the end of the term or current renewal thereof if notice of noncompliance with any material condition or restriction is mailed by certified mail to the permittee, at the address shown on the application for the permit or any new address of which the city planner subsequently receives written notice, more than 30 days before the end of the term or the renewal thereof then in effect and such noncompliance is not corrected within 30 days to the satisfaction of the city planner. 
The provisions of this section are cumulative with the power of injunction and other remedies afforded by law to the city and, further, shall not be so interpreted as to vest in any applicant any rights inconsistent or in conflict with the power of the city to rezone the subject property or to exercise any other power provided by law. 
Once a special use permit is granted, such use may be enlarged, extended, increased in intensity or relocated only in accordance with the provisions of this section unless the city council, in approving the initial permit, has specifically established alternative procedures for consideration of future expansion or enlargement. If the use that is the subject of the special use permit becomes a use permitted as a matter-of-right through subsequent amendment of this chapter, the special use permit conditions shall be voided but only to the extent they are more restrictive than those conditions applicable generally to such by-right use. 
Uses in a district for which a special use permit is required, which were legally existing without such a permit at the time of adoption of this chapter or an amendment thereto which required such a special use permit, shall not be deemed nonconforming uses, but shall, without further action, be deemed conforming special uses so long as they continue in existence. Such special uses shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (d) below with respect to any enlargement, extension, and increase in intensity or relocation. 
Where any special use is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of two years or more, the special use permit shall automatically terminate without notice. A use shall be deemed to have been "discontinued" when the use shall have ceased for any reason, regardless of the intent of the owner or occupier of the property to reinstitute the use at some later date. The approval of a new special use permit shall be required prior to any subsequent reinstatement of the use. 
1006.4(f) Amendment of special use permits. An amendment is a request for any enlargement, expansion, and increase in intensity, relocation, or modification of any condition of a previously approved and currently valid special use. Amendments shall be processed as follows: 
(a)  Non-material and insignificant modifications, shifts in location, slight changes in size, shape, intensity, or configuration may be authorized by the city planner provided there is nothing in the currently valid permit to preclude such action, the changes comply fully with other provisions of the permit and the Code, and that there will be a five percent or less increase in either lot coverage or floor area over what was originally approved. 
(b)  Minor enlargements, expansions, increases in intensity, relocations, or modifications of any conditions of an approved and currently valid special use may, without public hearing, be authorized, including the establishment or reestablishment of reasonable conditions, by resolution of the city council provided that such minor changes comply with the following criteria: 
(1)  There will be a cumulative total of less than a ten percent increase in either total lot coverage or floor area; 
(2)  There will be no detrimental impact on any adjacent property caused by significant change in the appearance or the use of the property or any other contributing factor; 
(3)  Nothing in the currently valid special use permit precludes or otherwise limits such expansion or enlargement; 
(4)  The proposal conforms to the provisions of this article and is in keeping with the spirit and intent of the adopted comprehensive plan. 
Any proposed amendment other than those provided for in subsections (1) and (2) above shall be considered a major amendment of a previously approved and currently valid special use and shall be approved in the same manner and under the same procedures as are applicable to the issuance of the original permit.

As part of the rezoning process, the proposed site access, site circulation and building design details regarding the overall building layout, proposed construction methods, and overall fire protection plan shall be reviewed and approved by the fire marshal and building official in accordance with current fire and building codes. The fire marshal and building official may impose additional or alternative requirements to the approval based on conditions to include, but not limited to, the type of building, construction type and/or the planned occupancy and use of the building and overall life safety considerations. 
In addition, city staff and the planning commission shall review the building elevations in accordance with the city's design guidelines ordinance.

Sec. 1006A. - LUC limited-use commercial district.[2] 
(1006A.1) Intent of district: It is intended that the LUC zoning district be established and reserved for restricted commercial business purposes. Recognizing that a commercial district with its variety of land uses could cause a detrimental impact on neighboring lands, the regulations which apply within this district are designed to encourage the formation and continuance of a stable, economically healthy and compatible environment for businesses to serve city and regional commercial needs and to promote the interests of the particular neighbors and the public welfare at large. These regulations are intended for use only when a commercial district, in its unrestricted form, would be an isolated district, unrelated and detrimental to the surrounding area. These regulations are also intended to reduce traffic congestion, provide for adequate off-street parking, prohibit the development of "strip" type business areas, and prohibit encroachment by other uses capable of adversely affecting the character of the district. 
(1006A.2) Permitted uses: Any one or more of the following uses may be permitted in any LUC zoning district. (The specific use and any related activity anticipated by the party requesting the rezoning must be delineated in the zoning request.) The property will be rezoned for one or more specific uses only to the exclusion of all other listed permitted uses.

(1008.5.3) Review procedures. Application for the establishment of special uses shall be submitted to the planning and development department and, upon determination that such application contains all necessary elements, shall be deemed received by the city and referred to the city council for its review and recommendation. 
In considering applications for special use permits, the city council shall use the standards set forth in section 1304 of this appendix and shall consider the following criteria: 
(a)  Compatibility of the proposed use and location with the policies established in the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Compatibility of the proposed use with the character of adjacent properties and the surrounding neighborhoods and with existing and proposed development. 
(c)  Availability of, or ability to provide, adequate utilities, drainage, parking and loading space, lighting, screening, landscaping and open space. 
(d)  Provision of safe and convenient vehicular, pedestrian, bicycle, and alternate modes of transportation. 
(e)  Compatibility of the proposed use with the intent and function of the GI zoning district.

Such additional standards may include, but are not limited to, special setbacks, buffer requirements, increased screening or landscaping requirements, and standards pertaining to traffic, circulation, noise, lighting, hours of operation and similar characteristics. 
(b)  Require that a performance guarantee, acceptable in form, content and amount to the city be posted by the applicant to ensure continued compliance with all conditions and requirements that may be specified. 
(c)  Specify time limits or expiration dates for any such special use permits, including provisions for periodic review and renewal. 
(1008.5.4) Procedures applicable to permits. Unless otherwise specified by the conditions of the permit, failure to establish the special use authorized by the permit within one year from the date of approval by the city council shall cause the permit to terminate automatically. The use shall be deemed "established" only if the land or buildings have been occupied and the proposed activity conducted within the one-year period. 
Unless otherwise specified in the conditions of a permit, the initial term of each special use permit shall be for one year from the date of approval. Upon compliance with those conditions and restrictions imposed by the city council and all relevant city ordinances, the special use permit shall, without application, be renewed automatically for additional successive one-year terms. However, a special use permit shall not be so renewed and shall expire at the end of the term or current renewal thereof if notice of noncompliance with any material condition or restriction is mailed by certified mail to the permittee, at the address shown on the application for the permit or any new address of which the planning and development department subsequently receives written notice, more than 30 days before the end of the term or the renewal thereof then in effect and such noncompliance is not corrected within 30 days to the satisfaction of the planning and development department. 
The provisions of this section are cumulative with the power of injunction and other remedies afforded by law to the city and, further, shall not be so interpreted as to vest in any applicant any rights inconsistent or in conflict with the power of the city to rezone the subject property or to exercise any other power provided by law. 
Once a special use permit is granted, such use may be enlarged, extended, increased in intensity or relocated only in accordance with the provisions of this section unless the city council, in approving the initial permit, has specifically established alternative procedures for consideration of future expansion or enlargement. If the use that is the subject of the special use permit becomes a use permitted as a matter-of-right through subsequent amendment of this appendix, the special use permit conditions shall be voided but only to the extent they are more restrictive than those conditions applicable generally to such by-right use. 
Uses in a district for which a special use permit is required, which were legally existing without such a permit at the time of adoption of this chapter or an amendment thereto which required such a special use permit, shall not be deemed nonconforming uses, but shall, without further action, be deemed conforming special uses so long as they continue in existence. Such special uses shall be subject to the provisions of section 1008.5.5 below with respect to any enlargement, extension, and increase in intensity or relocation. 
Where any special use is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of one year or more, the special use permit shall automatically terminate without notice. A use shall be deemed to have been "discontinued" when the use shall have ceased for any reason, regardless of the intent of the owner or occupier of the property to reinstitute the use at some later date. The approval of a new special use permit shall be required prior to any subsequent reinstatement of the use. 
(1008.5.5) Amendment of special use permits. An amendment is a request for any enlargement, expansion, and increase in intensity, relocation, or modification of any condition of a previously approved and currently valid special use. Amendments shall be processed as follows: 
(a)  Non-material and insignificant modifications, shifts in location, slight changes in size, shape, intensity, or configuration may be authorized by the planning and development department provided there is nothing in the currently valid permit to preclude such action, the changes comply fully with other provisions of the permit and the Code, and that there will be a five percent or less increase in either lot coverage or floor area over what was originally approved. 
(b)  Minor enlargements, expansions, increases in intensity, relocations, or modifications of any conditions of an approved and currently valid special use may, without public hearing, be authorized, including the establishment or reestablishment of reasonable conditions, by resolution of the city council provided that such minor changes comply with the following criteria: 
(1)  There will be a cumulative total of less than a ten percent increase in either total lot coverage or floor area; 
(2)  There will be no detrimental impact on any adjacent property caused by significant change in the appearance or the use of the property or any other contributing factor; 
(3)  Nothing in the currently valid special use permit precludes or otherwise limits such expansion or enlargement; 
(4)  The proposal conforms to the provisions of this article and is in keeping with the spirit and intent of the adopted comprehensive plan. 
Any proposed amendment other than those provided for in subsections (a) and (b) above shall be considered a major amendment of a previously approved and currently valid special use and shall be approved in the same manner and under the same procedures as are applicable to the issuance of the original permit.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 956, § 1, adopted August 7, 2008, repealed former § 1011 and enacted a new § 1011 as set out herein. The former section pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 269, § 1(C)(9), 6-3-1982; Ord. No. 366, § 19, 5-22-1985; Ord. No. 408, 8-21-1986. 
Sec. 1012. - Airport zoning. 
(1012.1) Airport (AI). 
(a)  Intent of district. It is intended that the AI zoning district be established for airport uses. The regulations which apply with this district are designed to encourage the formation and continuance of compatible environment for uses of a general aviation airport to protect and preserve undeveloped airport areas of Peachtree City which are suitable for such activities, and to prohibit other uses. 
(b)  Permitted uses. The following uses shall be permitted in any AI zoning district: 
(1)  Any airport or airport related uses which involves operation, storage, repair, manufacture, sales of fuel, oil, or aviation related parts or products, auto rentals, restaurant, vending services or any other use which would directly relate to the furtherance of the facility to operate as an airport. 
(1012.2) Airport district areas (AP). 
(a)  Airport district areas established as supplementary. The "AP" designation is not intended to be utilized as a separate district classification, but as a designation which identifies areas subject to regulations which are supplementary to the regulations of the district to which such designation is attached, appended, or "overlaid." Regulations which apply to areas designated on the zoning map as being within such appended or overlaid designation must be determined by joint reference to the regulations of both the basic district classification and the appended or overlay classification. 
(b)  Intent. It is the intent of this ordinance to restrain influences which are adverse to the property and safe conduct of aircraft in the vicinity of Falcon Field-Peachtree City Airport, to prevent creation of conditions hazardous to aircraft operation, to prevent conflict with land development which may result in loss of life and property, and to encourage development which is compatible with airport use characteristics within the intent and purpose of zoning. To this end, the "AP" designation, when appended to a basic district classification, is intended to coordinate the purpose and intent of this ordinance with other regulations duly established by Peachtree City whose primary intent is to further the purposes set out above. 
(c)  Definitions. 
(1)  Airport: Falcon Field—Peachtree City Airport. 
(2)  Airport elevation: The highest point of an airport's usable landing area measured in feet above mean sea level (808.0). 
(3)  Approach surface: A surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline, extending outward and upward from the end of the primary surface and at the same slope as the approach zone height limitation slope set forth in (1012.2)(c)(4) of this article. 
(4)  Approach zone (APA): The approach surface zone is an inclined plane located directly above the approach area. The dimensions of the approach area are measured horizontally. The inner edge approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and begins 200 feet from the runway end and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward to a width of 1,500 feet for noninstrumented runway at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface, and outward 34 feet for each foot upward to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface for nonprecision instrument runway. Its centerlines are the continuation of the centerlines of the runways. 
(5)  Conical surface: A surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of twenty to one (20:1) for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. 
(6)  Conical zone (APC): The conical zone is established on the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending outward therefrom for a distance of 4,000 feet, and upward at a slope of 20:1. 
(7)  Hazard to navigation: An obstruction determined to have a substantial adverse effect on the safety and efficient utilization of the navigable airspace. 
(8)  Height: For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this article and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified. 
(9)  Horizontal surface: A horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which in plan coincided with the perimeter of the horizontal zone. 
(10)  Horizontal zone (APH): The horizontal zone is a plane, circular in shape, with its height 150 feet above the established airport elevation of 808.0 [feet] msl and having a radius of 10,000 feet for the basic transport runway from the center of the end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. 
(11)  Obstruction: Any structure, growth, or other object, including a mobile object, which exceeds a limited height set forth in subsection (1012.2)(d) of this article. 
(12)  Primary surface: A surface longitudinally centered on a runway. The primary surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. The width of the primary surface is 500 feet for Falcon Field—Peachtree City Airport. 
(13)  Runway: A defined area on an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length. 
(14)  Structure: An object, including mobile object, constructed or installed by man, including but without limitation, building, towers, cranes, smokestacks, earth formations, and overhead transmission lines. 
(15)  Transitional surfaces: These surfaces extend outward to right angles (90-degree angles) to runway centerline and extends at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. 
(16)  Transitional zones (APT): The transitional zones are included planes beneath the transitional surfaces with a slope of 7:1 measured upward and outward in a vertical plane at right angles to the center line of the runway and extending 150 feet above the airport elevation of 808.0 [feet] above mean sea level. The 7:1 transitional surface also extends from the edges of all approach surfaces upward and outward to the intersection with the horizontal surface, or the conical surface zones. 
(d)  Airport zones height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this article [section] no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow or maintained in any airport approach surface zone, horizontal surface zone, conical surface zone or transitional surface zone to a height in excess of the height limit herein established for this zone. If the height limits of two zones covering the same area vary, the lower height limitation is controlling. 
(e)  Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article [section] no use may be made of land within any airport approach surface zone, horizontal surface zone, conical surface zone or transitional surface zone, in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of the flyers using the airport or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off or maneuvering of aircraft. 
(f)  Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure, tree or use of land not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this article [section] or otherwise interfere with the continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this article [section], and is diligently prosecuted. 
(2)  Obstruction—Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of the section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by Peachtree City Airport Authority to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the Peachtree City Airport Authority. 
(g)  Permits. The zoning administration (administrator) shall not issue a zoning permit within an "AI," "APA," "APH," "APT" or "APC" area until it has been determined that the proposal upon which he is requested to act is in compliance with the terms of these regulations. In order to determine whether or not a proposal is in compliance, the proposal shall be submitted to the airport authority for review and approval. Without the approval of the airport authority, a proposal is not in compliance. 
(1)  Future uses. Except as specifically provided in (i), (ii), and (iii) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article [section] shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with section (1012.2)(g)(4). 
(i)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
(ii)  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
(iii)  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure except when such tree or structure because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this article except as set forth in section (1012.2)(g). 
(2)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this ordinance or any amendment thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(3)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the zoning administration determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 75 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviation [deviate] from the zoning regulations. 
(4)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article may apply to the city council for a variance from such regulations. 
The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as [to] the effect of the proposal on the operation or air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief, if granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article [section]. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of this application has been furnished to the airport manager and the Peachtree City Airport Authority for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport manager and/or the airport authority does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
(5)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article [section] and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the Peachtree City Airport Authority, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.

It is intended that the LUR-5 zoning district be established specifically for a planned cluster housing project designed in accordance with the development plan shown on Exhibit "A;" that it be developed with minimum setbacks as specified in Section 1004.4, paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) for detached structures; and that it also be subject to the following conditions: 
1.  The final development plan will show the strip of land that will be required for the widening of GA 74. At this time it is anticipated that a strip about 25 feet wide will be needed. The developer agrees to dedicate this strip at no cost to the public. 
2.  The 75-foot wide greenbelt along GA 74 will be measured from the proposed new right-of-way line rather than the existing line. 
3.  In order to provide the land necessary for the highway expansion and the greenbelt, Lot 24 will be eliminated and converted to greenbelt. 
4.  The house of Lot 23 will be located as far to the east as possible in order to maximize its separation from the highway. 
5.  The existing utility lines will be removed from the area between the project and the houses along Cedar Drive. The 35-foot buffer area will be labeled a tree-save buffer. That area will be re-landscaped with berms and vegetation to provide a permanent, meaningful, and effective separation between the two subdivisions; and 
6.  Stormwater detention will be handled as a part of an area-wide stormwater management program. If for some reason this is not possible, the project will not be approved as presented. A detention pond in the back yard of one of the lots (Lot 8) would be totally out of character with the rest of the subdivision, which otherwise appears to be well designed.

A detailed landscape plan shall be prepared and submitted to city staff and the planning commission for review and approval prior to any disturbance to or the installation of any enhancements within these buffer areas. 
4.  The applicant shall coordinate with city staff to identify locations of traffic calming devices and shall incorporate these into the design and construction of MacDuff Parkway at no cost to the city. 
5.  The applicant shall coordinate with city staff to determine if a multi-use path tunnel can be constructed underneath MacDuff Parkway as a part of the road improvements.

Following this dedication, the maintenance of the landscaping within the right-of-way shall be the sole responsibility of the Homeowner's Association in perpetuity. 
9.  There shall be no more than 734 total lots within the overall subdivision. The concept plat submitted as a part of the annexation and rezoning request is illustrative only. The developer shall prepare a detailed development plan, which must be approved by the planning commission as a part of the concept plat approval process. It is understood the general layout of the streets and individual lots will be similar to what is shown on the concept plat once final engineering documents are prepared. 
10.  Existing vegetation within the areas identified as open space on the concept plat shall be protected prior to, during and following construction activities. 
11.  The buffer separating the residential lots along the northern property boundary shall be increased to no less than 100 feet in width, and this area shall be dedicated to the city as greenbelt. 
12.  Existing vegetation within the 50-foot buffer around the perimeter of the property shall be preserved to the greatest extent practicable prior to, during and following construction activities. These areas shall be dedicated to the city as greenbelt. 
13.  The overall development shall comply with the city's post-construction stormwater runoff management ordinance and provide water quality best management practices (BMP's) on greenbelt areas dedicated to the city. 
14.  The location of the floodplain shall be field located and surveyed prior to preparation of the engineering drawings. Absolutely no development shall be permitted within the floodplain with the exception of perpendicular road and utility crossings. 
15.  The maintenance of all internal parks, landscaped areas, signage and subdivision entrances shall be the sole responsibility of the developer and/or the homeowner's association. 
16.  The applicant shall establish deed covenants for the overall subdivision that shall limit rental units to no more than 20 percent of the total number of dwelling units in the subdivision.

17.  The developer shall pay impact fees for each residential lot within the subdivision as identified within the city's impact fee ordinance. 
18.  At the applicant's request, the property and units constructed thereon shall be restricted to housing for older persons as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 3607. Said development shall be intended and operated for occupancy by persons 55 years of age or older, and at least 80 percent of the occupied units shall be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older. The city shall publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate the intent required under this provision. In addition, the developer and its successors and assigns shall comply with rules issued by the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development for verification of occupancy, which shall provide for verification by reliable surveys and affidavits and include examples of the types of policies and procedures relevant to a determination of compliance with the requirement of this paragraph 18. 
19.  The annexation and rezoning is conditioned upon the execution of the development agreement between the city and the applicant attached hereto. The development agreement shall be recorded in the Deed Records of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Fayette County, Georgia, so as to provide notice of the conditions of this zoning to all parties in interest. 
20.  The annexation and rezoning as proposed is conditioned upon the annexation of the John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods tract to the south. 
21.  Should a suitable tract of land be made available to the city at no cost, the city will consider relocating the proposed fire station site such that it will not be located within 1,000 LF of the main entrance into the subdivision. In this case, "suitable" shall mean a site that meets the needs of fire and emergency services; a site that will not create additional gaps in coverage or service areas; a site that has access to adjoining roadways; a site with readily available utilities; and a site with no significant grading and/ or fill issues, environmental impacts or other design issues.

Sec. 1014. - LUI limited-use industrial. 
(1014.1) Intent of district. It is intended that the LUI zoning district be established and reserved for restricted industrial and industrial support purposes. The regulations which apply to these districts are intended to encourage the preparation of innovative site plans, and to offer developers a degree of flexibility in planning and implementing their projects that is not available otherwise. 
(1014.2) Eligibility. In order to be eligible for LUI zoning, a project site must contain at least five acres, it must be in one ownership, and it must have direct access to a major thoroughfare. 
(1014.3) Establishment of district. In order to establish an LUI zoning district, a developer must prepare a complete development plan, including his own restrictions to be imposed on the development. If approved by both the planning commission and the city council, the complete development plan will become a part of the zoning restrictions for the district. The planning commission and the city council are under no obligation to approve a proposed LUI district, and the planning commission and city council may change a developer's proposal in any way necessary to protect the public interest and promote the master development plan for the city. Once an LUI zoning district is established, the adopted development plan may be changed only by appropriately amending the zoning ordinance. 
(1014.4) Permitted uses. Any use may be permitted in an LUI zoning district that is permitted in a limited industrial district or in a general industrial district. However, the permitted use must be explicitly specified in the development plan for each proposed district, and explicitly approved by the planning commission and the city council. The planning commission and city council are under no obligation to approve any proposed use. 
(1014.5) Development standards. The development standards for any proposed LUI zoning district must be explicitly defined by the developer and approved by the planning commission and the city council. If specific standards are not adopted for a particular aspect of a development, the appropriate existing standards in the zoning ordinance will apply. In no instance will any site development within an LUI zoning district take place within 300 feet of a residential zoning district. 
(1014.6) Changes. Once an LUI zoning district is adopted and entered onto the official zoning map, no change may be made to the permitted uses, development standards, or any specifically approved aspect of the total development plan unless it is changed in accordance with the established amendment procedures set forth in this ordinance.

The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible based upon the current zoning classification of the property. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations. 
(1016.3) Application requirements. 
(a)  Site analysis map. Concurrent with the submission of a concept plat, the applicant shall prepare and submit a detailed site analysis map. The purpose of the site analysis map is to ensure the important site features have been adequately identified prior to the creation of the site design, and that the proposed open space will meet the requirements of this article.

4)  Above-ground utility rights-of-way and small areas of impervious surface may be included within the protected open space but cannot be counted towards the 40 percent minimum area requirement. Large areas of impervious surface shall be excluded from the open space. 
5)  At least 75 percent of the open space shall be in a contiguous tract. The open space should adjoin any neighboring areas of open space, other protected areas, and non-protected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected open space. 
6)  The open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Non-adjoining lots shall be provided with safe, convenient access to the open space.

If a homeowners association is the owner, membership in the association shall be mandatory and automatic for all homeowners of the subdivision and their successors. If a homeowners association is the owner, the homeowners' association shall have lien authority to ensure the collection of dues from all members. The responsibility for maintaining the open space and any facilities located thereon shall be borne by the owner. 
2)  Management plan. The applicant shall submit a plan for management of open space and common facilities ("plan") that:

Such costs shall become a lien on all subdivision properties. 
(f)  Legal instrument for permanent protection. 
1)  The open space shall be protected in perpetuity by a binding legal instrument that is recorded with the deed. The instrument shall be one of the following: 
(a)  A permanent conservation easement in favor of either: 
(1)  A land trust or similar conservation-oriented non-profit organization with legal authority to accept such easements. The organization shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the conveyance instruments shall contain an appropriate provision for retransfer in the event the organization becomes unable to carry out its functions; or 
(2)  A governmental entity with an interest in pursuing goals compatible with the purposes of this ordinance. If the entity accepting the easement is not the city, then a third right of enforcement favoring the city shall be included in the easement; 
(b)  A permanent restrictive covenant for conservation purposes in favor of a governmental entity; or 
(c)  An equivalent legal tool that provides permanent protection, if approved by the city. 
2)  The instrument for permanent protection shall include clear restrictions on the use of the open space. These restrictions shall include all restrictions contained in this article, as well as any further restrictions the Applicant chooses to place on the use of the open space. 
(g)  Special use permit. 
1)  Certain uses, because of their unique characteristics or potential impacts on adjacent land uses, are not generally permitted within the zoning districts as a matter of right, but may, under the right set of circumstances and conditions be acceptable in certain specific locations. These uses are permitted only through the issuance of a special use permit by the mayor and city council after ensuring that the use can be appropriately accommodated on the specific property, will be in conformance with the comprehensive plan, can be constructed and operated in a manner which is compatible with the surrounding land uses and overall character of the community, and that the public interest and general welfare of the citizens of the city will be protected. 
2)  No inherent right exists to receive a special use permit; such permits are a special privilege granted by the city under a specific set of circumstances and conditions, and each application and situation is unique. Consequently, mere compliance with the generally applicable requirements may not be sufficient and additional measures, occasionally substantial, may be necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed development. In other situations, no set of conditions would be sufficient to approve an application, even though the same request in another location might be approved. 
3)  Review procedures. 
(a)  Application for the establishment of special uses shall be submitted to the city planner and, upon determination that such application contains all necessary elements, shall be deemed received by the city and referred to the planning commission for its review and recommendation. 
(b)  The planning commission shall report to the mayor and city council its recommendation as to the approval or disapproval of such application and any recommendation for establishment of conditions, in addition to those set forth in this article, deemed necessary to protect the public interest and welfare. 
(c)  In considering applications for special use permits, the planning commission and city council shall use the standards set forth in section 1305 of the city zoning ordinance and shall consider the following criteria: 
(1)  Compatibility of the proposed use and location with the policies established in the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Compatibility of the proposed use with the character of adjacent properties and the surrounding neighborhoods and with existing and proposed development. 
(3)  Availability of, or ability to provide, adequate utilities, drainage, parking and loading space, lighting, screening, landscaping and open space. 
(4)  Provision of safe and convenient vehicular, pedestrian, bicycle, and alternate modes of transportation. 
(5)  Compatibility of the proposed use with the intent and function of the zoning district, based upon the current zoning classification of the property. 
(6)  Compliance with applicable performance standards and requirements as set forth in the city's land development ordinance. 
(d)  In approving any application for special use permit, the city may by resolution: 
(1)  Impose such reasonable standards, conditions or requirements, in addition to any specified within this chapter, as it may deem necessary to protect the public interest and welfare. Such additional standards may include, but are not limited to, special setbacks, buffer requirements, increased screening or landscaping requirements, and standards pertaining to traffic, circulation, noise, lighting, hours of operation and similar characteristics. 
(2)  Require that a performance guarantee, acceptable in form, content and amount to the city be posted by the applicant to ensure continued compliance with all conditions and requirements that may be specified. 
(3)  Specify time limits or expiration dates for any such special use permits, including provisions for periodic review and renewal.

ARTICLE XII. - VARIANCES AND APPEALS[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 934, § 1, adopted February 21, 2008, amended article XII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, article XII pertained to appeals, and derived from Ord. No. 574, adopted April 16, 1992; Ord. No. 589, adopted November 19, 1992; Ord. No. 618, adopted July 7, 1994; Ord. No. 877, adopted March 16, 2006. 

Sec. 1201. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this section is to authorize variances from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. A variance is a request for relief from the provisions of the zoning ordinance. The power to grant a variance does not extend to use restrictions established within a particular zoning district 
(Ord. No. 934, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Sec. 1202. - Application. 
An application for a variance may be submitted only by the owner of the property for which a variance is desired or his authorized agent. Application requirements shall be as described herein. 
Variances may be considered in all districts and shall only be granted upon showing that: 
(a)  Relief, if granted, would be in harmony with, or, could be made to be in harmony with, the general purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance; or 
(b)  The application of the particular provision of the zoning ordinance to a particular piece of property, due to extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to that property because of its size, shape, or topography, would create an unnecessary hardship for the owner while causing no detriment to the public. 
(Ord. No. 934, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Sec. 1203. - Variance type. 
The zoning administrator shall determine the type of variance required, and shall classify the request as: 
(a)  Administrative variance. 
(b)  Special exception variance. 
(c)  Variance. 
(Ord. No. 934, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Sec. 1204. - Administrative variance. 
Review and approval of a request for an administrative variance shall be administered by a special administrative variance committee consisting of the zoning administrator, the city manager and a member of city council. Applications may be considered only if the following requirements are met: 
(a)  The request only pertains to a zoning setback requirement; 
(b)  The request only pertains to an existing setback violation; 
(c)  The request is for an encroachment that would not exceed 25 percent of the required setback, up to a maximum of ten feet; 
(d)  The setback violation being requested has been existing for at least one year; and 
(e)  The property owner making the request is not the same property owner who was responsible for the violation. 
In reviewing the application, the administrative variance committee shall analyze the application to determine whether granting the request would cause substantial detriment to other property owners in the surrounding area or would impair the purposes of the zoning ordinance. If it is found that the request is in conformance with these requirements and does not adversely affect the area, the administrative variance committee shall issue an official determination in writing approving the request. The property owner, the city clerk, and the building official shall be provided with a copy of this determination. 
If it is found that the request is not in conformance with these requirements or may possibly have an adverse effect on the surrounding area, the administrative variance committee shall deny the appeal in writing, stating the reasons for the denial. 
The administrative variance committee shall act on all appeals within 15 working days after the application is deemed complete by the zoning administrator. 
If a request for an administrative variance is denied by the administrative variance committee, the property owner may appeal this decision to the city council in accordance with the procedures identified herein. 
(Ord. No. 934, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Sec. 1205. - Special exception variance. 
A special exception variance is recognized as having a potential impact on only the immediate neighborhood and adjoining properties. Review and approval of special exception variance requests shall be administered by the zoning administrator, city staff (as applicable), the planning commission and city council. 
A special exception variance may be considered for only the following: 
(a)  A decrease of not more than 25 percent of the minimum building setback; provided that the property line in question and the associated building setback adjoins a city-owned greenbelt or open space and there is no other possible location on the property that would accommodate the proposed building expansion without encroaching into the established building setback. 
(b)  A decrease of not more than 25 percent in the minimum number of parking spaces required by the city's parking ordinance; provided the applicant identifies on the site plan where this parking would be located if needed in the future. 
(c)  An increase in the maximum height of a fence or wall; provided that: 
(1)  Such wall or fence is justified by reason of security or privacy and will not unduly prevent passage of light and air to adjoining properties and is not incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood; 
(2)  Such greater height is justified by requirements for security of persons or property in the area; 
(3)  Such greater height is justified for topographic reasons; or 
(4)  Such greater height, in the yard or yards involved, is not incompatible with the character of the surrounding neighborhood. 
In no case shall a special exception variance be granted from the conditions of approval imposed on a parcel through a zoning change granted by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 934, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Sec. 1206. - Variance. 
A variance is recognized as having potential impact on the larger area and may affect enforcement of the zoning ordinance elsewhere in the city. A request for variance shall be reviewed by the zoning administrator, city staff (as applicable), and city council. 
(Ord. No. 934, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Sec. 1207. - Review criteria. 
In reviewing a request for a variance, the city council shall not grant the request unless all of the following findings can be made: 
(a)  There are special circumstances applicable to the property, including location, shape, size, surroundings, or topography so that the strict application of this ordinance denies the property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning district classification; 
(b)  The strict or literal interpretation and application of this ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance, or would deprive the applicant of privileges granted to others in similar circumstances; 
(c)  There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or the intended development of the property which preclude the applicant from complying with this ordinance and that do not apply generally to other property in the same zoning district and which prevent the applicant from complying with existing regulations; 
(d)  The granting of such variance will not constitute the granting of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations on other property in the same zoning district; and 
(e)  The granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or general welfare nor injurious to property or improvements in the zone or neighborhood in which the property is located. 
(f)  The granting of such variance will not create inconsistencies with any objective of the comprehensive plan. 
If it is found that the request is not in conformance with these requirements or may possibly have an adverse effect on the surrounding area, the city council shall deny the request in writing, stating the reasons for the denial. 
(Ord. No. 934, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Sec. 1208. - Filing procedure. 
All variance applications shall be filed with the zoning administrator on forms provided by the zoning administrator.

ARTICLE XIV. - MULTI-FAMILY—REZONING MORATORIIUM[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 727, adopted Nov. 4, 1999, renumbered art. XIV, §§ 1401—1404 to art. XV, §§ 1501—1504 and added a new art. XIV, §§ 1401—1404 as herein set out. 

Sec. 1401. - Purpose. 
In order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, the city has determined that a moratorium on the zoning or rezoning of property for development of multifamily housing needs to be adopted and enforced for all property in the City of Peachtree City not currently zoned for use as multifamily. 
This moratorium is intended to promote: the orderly development of property in the city; maintain the high quality of police services now provided; maintain the high quality of emergency and fire services now provided; maintain the quality of education now provided; maintain the high quality of life now existing; help reduce traffic congestion; and ameliorate air quality standards. 
(Ord. No. 727, 11-4-1999) 
Sec. 1402. - Findings. 
The mayor and council have made the following findings of fact in consideration of this moratorium: 
(a)  The development of additional multifamily housing would create a significant burden on the police department and emergency and fire departments for the city; 
(b)  The development of additional multi-family housing would overburden area schools 
(c)  The development of additional multi-family housing would exhaust available resources, thus reducing the quality of life now existing; and 
(d)  The development of additional multi-family housing would increase traffic congestion, which also reduces air quality. 
(Ord. No. 727, 11-4-1999) 
Sec. 1403. - Moratorium. 
The Mayor and Council of the City of Peachtree City hereby directs its staff to accept no applications seeking to zone or rezone property to any designation that would allow the development of the property as multi-family. 
(a)  Multi-family shall include apartments, townhouses, duplexes, condominiums and assisted living facilities. 
(b)  This moratorium shall be in effect for a period of one year and shall automatically expire if not reviewed by the mayor and council and if deemed necessary, renewed. 
(c)  This moratorium shall not apply to property already zoned for use as multifamily. 
(Ord. No. 727, 11-4-1999) 
Sec. 1404. - Appeals. 
Any party with an ownership interest in property in the city that believes said property owner is severely prejudiced by this moratorium may file an application with the city planner requesting that the mayor and council remove the moratorium as it applies to the property. 
(a)  The application shall be accepted by the city planner and placed on the council agenda after being properly advertised, and then, considered by the mayor and council. 
(b)  City staff shall only provide council with current land use and zoning information regarding the subject property and its surrounding properties and shall not make a recommendation to council on the application to lift the moratorium. 
(c)  In the event council lifts the moratorium, the property owner may then submit the request for rezoning following established procedures. 
(d)  In the event council declines to lift the moratorium, the property owner shall have the same rights and follow the same procedures as those connected with the denial of a rezoning request.

Collectors form barriers between neighborhoods and are designed for higher speeds and traffic volumes than are residential streets. Collectors are classified as major collectors and minor collectors. 
a.  Major collector. The primary function is to carry traffic for most major intraurban trips over one mile, particularly during peak hours. These streets provide only limited direct access to adjacent land. This direct access is usually focused on major facilities, shopping centers or other significant traffic generators. Major collectors are usually designed with four travel lanes and may be either divided or undivided. 
b.  Minor collector. The primary function is to carry traffic for short to medium (one-half to one mile) intraurban trips. These strips receive traffic from residential streets and transmit it to major collectors and arterials. Minor collectors spaced to relieve excessive traffic volumes on local streets, are commonly designed with two travel lanes. 
(4)  Commercial street. A commercial street is a minor road within a commercial area intended primarily to provide access to adjoining property. 
(5)  Community collector road. A community collector road is a thoroughfare intended primarily to move traffic from one village to another, or to an area outside the city. 
(6)  County collector road. A part of the Fayette County road system that is designed and built to county thoroughfare standards with a minimum right-of-way width of 80 feet and a minimum pavement width of 24 feet and, generally, no curb and gutter. 
(7)  Divided street. Any street with a median greater than 100 feet separating the travel lanes. A divided street may be a major collector, minor collector, industrial, commercial or residential street.

(10)  Neighborhood collector road. A neighborhood collector road is a thoroughfare intended primarily to move traffic through a particular residential neighborhood. 
(11)  Private street. Private street means any parcel of land set aside to provide access to development and which will not be dedicated or deeded to the city. These streets shall be constructed to standards adopted by the City of Peachtree City. As of May 3, 2001, no private street shall be approved by the city if it is intended to provide access to one or more single-family residential lots that are not also directly served by an approved public street. 
(12)  Public street. Public street shall mean any right-of-way dedicated or deeded to and accepted by the city for purposes of public travel. Public streets shall be constructed to standards adopted by the City of Peachtree City. 
(13)  Public street, low-density. Shall mean any public right-of-way located in estate residential (ER) or agricultural reserve (AR) zoning districts which meet the following conditions: 
a.  That planned or possible future development will not exceed 30 lots being served by such a street. 
b.  That all lots served by such a street have a minimum width of 250 feet on said street.

(17)  Service road. A thoroughfare which runs roughly parallel to an arterial highway and is primarily intended to provide access to nonresidential property that is adjacent to the arterial highway. 
(18)  Thoroughfare. A thoroughfare is a major road or highway intended primarily for traffic that is passing through an area. 
(19)  Tree-save/landscape buffer. A buffer area within which it is permitted to remove understory vegetation and tree limbs in order to allow for development on adjacent property to be seen from a major thoroughfare. Modification of a buffer can only be done with the approval of the city landscape architect. In addition to understory clearing and limbing, it can include limited grading, berming, and relandscaping, provided none of the modifications to the buffer adversely affect the existing mature trees in the buffer. 
(20)  Village collector road. A village collector road is a thoroughfare intended primarily to move traffic from one area of a village to another area in that same village. 
(nnn)  Structural erosion and sediment control practices. Measures for the stabilization of erosive or sediment-producing areas by utilizing the mechanical properties of matter for the purpose of either changing the surface of the land or storing, regulating or disposing of runoff to prevent excessive sediment loss.

(rrr)  Substantial improvement. Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure, either: (1) before the improvement or repair is started, or (2) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.

Any person who after the effective date of this ordinance engages in development shall pay a development impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this ordinance. 
(a)  Construction not subject to impact fees. 
The following projects and construction activities do not constitute "development" as defined in this ordinance, and are therefore not subject to the imposition of impact fees: 
(1)  Rebuilding no more than the same number of residential units of development or the same square footage for retail, commercial and/or industrial development as defined in this ordinance that were removed by demolition, or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe, on the same lot or property. 
(2)  Remodeling or repairing a structure that does not result in an increase in the number of units of development or an increase in the total square footage of retail, commercial and/or industrial development. 
(3)  Replacing a residential housing unit with another housing unit on the same lot or property. 
(4)  Replacing an existing retail, commercial and/or industrial building with a building of similar size and use on the same lot or property.

(6)  Constructing an addition to or expansion of a residential housing unit that does not increase the number of housing units. 
(7)  Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses and intended for the personal use of the residents, such as a deck or patio, satellite antenna, pet enclosure, or private recreational facilities such as a swimming pool. 
(b)  Grandfathered projects. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, that portion of a project for which an impact fee has been paid or is due and owed to the city under the previous ordinance shall not be subject to development impact fees pursuant to this ordinance unless as otherwise required by this ordinance. 
Any building for which a valid and complete application for a building permit has been received prior to the effective date of this ordinance may proceed without payment of fees otherwise imposed by this ordinance, provided that: 
(1)  All fees and development exactions in effect prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall be or have been paid in full; and 
(2)  Said construction shall be commenced, pursued and completed within the time established by the building permit, or within 180 days, whichever is later. If said construction is not completed within this timeframe, the city shall impose additional impact fees that are in effect at the time construction is complete. 
(c)  Method of calculation. 
Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this ordinance shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ordinance, the calculation of impact fees shall be net of credits for the present value of ad valorem taxes or other revenues as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and which: 
(1)  Are reasonably expected to be generated by new growth and development; and 
(2)  Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed. 
The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this ordinance shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of Peachtree City, Georgia, and may be amended from time to time by official act. 
In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
307.7 Fee assessment and payment. 
(a)  Impact fee schedule. 
Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment "A" for a property located inside of Peachtree City, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by Peachtree City, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. 
In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the impact fee schedule or fits within a different category, then: 
The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee. 
In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted impact fee schedule. 
If a land use designation is not in a category contained in this ordinance, then an appropriate new category may be added by the administrator and an appropriate fee established under the city's current impact fee methodology, subject to annual confirmation by the city council. 
Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this ordinance. 
(b)  Timing of assessment and payment. 
Development impact fees shall be assessed at the time of application for a building permit. All development impact fees shall be due and collected prior to issuance of a building permit. 
For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property. 
If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy. An adjustment may result in a refund to the fee payor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit. 
(c)  Individual assessment determinations. 
Individual assessments of development impact fees may be established as follows: 
At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project in lieu of the fee established on the impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment "A". 
In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. Each individual assessment study shall: 
(1)  Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data; or 
(2)  Be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in Peachtree City or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to accepted methodology; and 
(3)  Provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination. 
(4)  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this ordinance. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this ordinance. 
(5)  Any fee approved as an individual assessment determination shall have standing for 180 days following the date of approval. Payment of such an approved individual assessment determination shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by Peachtree City, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
(d)  Fee certification. 
Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certification of the development impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment "A" or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable. Such certified schedule or fee shall establish the development impact fee due for a period of 180 days from the date of certification, even if new or revised rate schedules are adopted in the interim. 
307.8. Exemptions. 
(a)  Exemption policy. 
The city council of Peachtree City finds that certain office or industrial uses that create unusually high investment, economic or job creation benefits represent extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the City of Peachtree City in proportion to the creation of such benefits. To encourage such development projects, the city council may consider granting a reduction in the impact fee based on a determination and relative to the extent that the business or project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to Peachtree City, as adopted in the exemption criteria. It is also recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees. 
(b)  Evaluation criteria. 
The following factors, among others, shall be considered in determining the extent to which a development project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the City of Peachtree City: 
1.  Use: Preference will be given to the construction or expansion of national or regional corporate office facilities and to construction or expansion of projects related to industries primarily involved in research and development, assembly, manufacturing or distribution. Particular consideration will be given to development and/or redevelopment of structures in those areas identified as character areas in the city's comprehensive plan. 
2.  Investment: The total amount of new private capital investment in land, buildings and equipment related to the project and to the total capital investment in current facilities if the project expands an existing business within the city. 
3.  Annual economic impact: The total annual amount of new wages, purchases, employee travel and training and related expenses, and other expenditures that will be generated as a result of the project and to the total annual economic impact of current facilities if the project expands an existing business within the city. 
4.  Job creation: 
a.  The total number of jobs created and/or retained as a result of the project. 
b.  The number of jobs created and/or retained paying at least 100 percent of the average wage for Fayette County as established by the Georgia Department of Labor. 
c.  The number of jobs created or retained that are exempt managerial and/or professional and/or senior executive jobs. 
(c)  Impact fee exemption guidelines. 
Any applicant for an exemption shall present a written request for such an exemption to the administrator. The request shall include such data of relevance to the evaluation criteria and may include any relevant documents in support of the request. 
The administrator shall forward the application to any and all boards, commissions, or authorities of the City or Fayette County, as applicable, who shall review the request and provide their recommendation to the administrator. At a minimum, the administrator shall forward the application to the Development Authority of Peachtree City (DAPC) for review and consideration and recommendation. Each recommendation shall be included in the information provided by the administrator to city council. 
The administrator shall prepare a report for the city council with a recommendation on whether or not the exemption should be granted and, if so, what amount should be exempted. The amount of the exemption shall be related to the public benefit, as determined under the evaluation criteria, and such other factors as the administrator may consider relevant. Acting upon the recommendation of the Administrator, but not bound by such recommendation, an impact fee exemption shall then be determined by the city council for a development or expansion project that is determined to represent extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the City of Peachtree City. 
The amount of the exemption shall be limited as follows: 
1.  Business-related development and expansion projects may be considered for an impact fee exemption of up to 50 percent of the fee otherwise due, reflecting the extent to which the project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth under the evaluation criteria. 
2.  An additional impact fee exemption of up to 25 percent may be considered for such a project that is or is proposed to be located entirely within the Peachtree City Industrial Park. 
3.  An additional impact fee exemption of up to 25 percent may be considered if such a project represents an expansion of an existing building already located within the Peachtree City Industrial Park. 
(d)  Reimbursement of impact fee fund. 
It is recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees. As a part of the project budgeting process, adequate funds shall be identified and transferred to the impact fee fund accounts equal to the amount of all exemptions granted. Any such funds shall be transferred over a period of time equal to the time period over which the project is financed. 
(e)  The city council may grant or deny an exemption taking into account the criteria set forth herein, the economic condition of the city, and the city's impact fee fund and program. The decision by the city council to grant or deny an exemption shall be discretionary, and each application for an exemption shall be reviewed on its own merits, taking the factors set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) into consideration. City council is under no obligation to take action and exempt any application regardless of its similarity to a previously approved application. 
307.9. Deposit and expenditure of fees. 
(a)  Maintenance of funds. 
All development impact fee funds collected for future expenditure on construction or expansion of facilities pursuant to this ordinance shall be maintained in one or more interest-bearing accounts until encumbered or expended. Restrictions on the investment of development impact fee funds shall be the same that apply to investment of all such funds generally. 
Separate accounting records shall be maintained for each category of system improvements within each service area wherein fees are collected. 
Interest earned on development impact fees shall be considered funds of the account on which it is earned and shall be subject to all restrictions placed on the use of development impact fees under this ordinance. 
(b)  Expenditures; restrictions. 
Expenditures from the impact fee accounts shall be made only for the category of system improvements within the service area for which the development impact fee was assessed and collected. 
Except as provided below, development impact fees shall not be expended for any purpose that does not involve building or expanding system improvements that create additional capacity available to serve new growth and development. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ordinance, the following shall be considered general revenue of Peachtree City, and may be expended accordingly: 
(1)  Impact fees collected to recover the present value of excess capacity in existing system improvements; 
(2)  Any portion of an impact fee collected as a repayment for expenditures made by Peachtree City for system improvements intended to be funded by such impact fee; and 
(3)  Any portion of the impact fee (but not to exceed three percent of the total) collected and allocated by the administrator for administration of the impact fee ordinance, and such additional amount assessed for repayment of the cost of preparing the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Annual report. 
The administrator shall prepare an annual report to the city council as part of the annual audit describing the amount of any development impact fees collected, encumbered, and used during the preceding fiscal year by category of public facility and service area. 
Such annual report shall be prepared following guidelines of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA), and submitted to DCA in conjunction with the annual update of the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
307.10. Credits. 
When eligible, fee payors shall be entitled to a credit against impact fees otherwise due and owing under the circumstances and in the manner set forth in this section. 
(a)  Credits; restrictions. 
Except as provided in paragraph 2 below, no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this ordinance. 
If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) prior to the effective date of this ordinance for system improvements that are included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive land use plan, is greater than the impact fee that would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ordinance, any credit due under this section shall not constitute a liability of Peachtree City, and shall accrue to the developer to the extent of impact fees assessed for new development for the same category of system improvements within the same service area. 
In no event shall credit be given for project improvements, or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Granting of credits. 
Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that: 
(1)  The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive land use plan; 
(2)  The amount of the credit does not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding, as shown in the capital improvements element; and 
(3)  The city council shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction, dedication, or transfer. 
(4)  The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is authorized under a private agreement executed under the provisions of section 9 of this ordinance. 
(c)  Guidelines for credit valuation. 
Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines: 
(1)  For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated.

(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
DIVISION 1. - STANDARDS FOR SITE DESIGN 

Sec. 702. - Protecting the natural environment. 
Prior to preparation and submittal of a site plan, the applicant should evaluate the proposed development's compatibility with the existing environment to determine the limitations and capabilities of the site for development. To the greatest extent practicable, the site plan shall be prepared in a manner that will conserve and protect natural resources, including air quality, trees, natural vegetation, existing topography, streams, creeks, wetlands, watersheds, water quality, and wildlife habitat. Development of each site should be limited to a level that does not exceed the capabilities and requirements of a healthy environment. 
Existing vegetation should be retained to the maximum extent possible. Clearing of native vegetation should be limited to that required for the provision of essential purposes (i.e., access, building, sewage disposal, etc.). Where appropriate, existing native vegetation should be enhanced with plantings of the same variety. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 703. - Access. 
The entire parcel, rather than simply a particular project, shall be considered in formulating and approving access plans. Interparcel site access, for pedestrians, golf carts and vehicles, should be provided to adjacent properties when land uses are compatible. Common access easements for shared driveways along state highways and busy streets are strongly encouraged. 
If at all feasible with the development plan, service functions (e.g., deliveries, maintenance activities) shall be integrated into the circulation pattern in a manner that minimizes conflicts with vehicles and pedestrians. Commercial and industrial developments should have service and loading areas separate from main circulation and parking areas. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 704. - Grading plan. 
Developments should be designed to fit the existing contours and landform of the site and to minimize the amount of earthwork. Excavation and earthwork should be kept to a minimum to reduce visual impacts and erosion. Where cut and fill is required, balancing the cut and fill is highly encouraged. 
Abrupt or unnatural-appearing grading is strongly discouraged. Every effort should be made to avoid the creation of harsh, easily eroded banks and cuts. The height and length of retaining walls should be minimized and screened with appropriate landscaping. Tall, smooth-faced concrete retaining walls should be avoided in highly visible areas. Where this is not possible, the walls shall be finished in a manner that is compatible with the exterior of the building and screened with landscaping. Terracing should be considered as an alternative to the use of tall or prominent retaining walls, particularly in highly visible areas. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 705. - Fences and walls. 
The design of fences and walls shall be compatible with the architecture of the main building(s) and should use similar building materials. All walls or fences 50 feet in length or longer, and four feet in height or taller, should be designed to minimize visual monotony by changing plane, height, material or material texture, or significant landscape massing. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 706. - Multi-use paths. 
The planning commission shall require multi-use paths in order to facilitate pedestrian and golf cart access from residential and commercial developments to schools, parks, playgrounds and other city amenities via the multi-use path system. If, at the time of conceptual approval, there are no completed multi-use paths to which the multi-use paths of the proposed developer can be linked, the planning commission shall require that the developer, in lieu of installing the multi-use paths, dedicate the easements and deposit a cash payment with the city council equal to the cost of installing the multi-use paths. This cost shall be determined by the city engineer. Such deposit shall be placed in a multi-use path construction fund to be established by the city council. When the multi-use system is extended to the boundary of the development, the city council will use the deposit to construct the multi-use paths in the development. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 707. - Utility lines. 
All utility lines within the city shall be placed underground with the following exceptions: 
(1)  Those lines which were in place above ground prior to May 21, 1987; 
(2)  Those lines, temporary in nature, which are intended to provide immediate service to an area for a period not to exceed 180 days, subject to the approval of the city engineer; 
(3)  Major transmission lines which do not provide service to adjoining properties, but are intended to distribute service between substations, subject to the approval of the city engineer; and 
(4)  When an electric distribution line already exists overhead on, adjacent to, or across the street from a piece of property zoned for industrial use, that line may be extended overhead to the industrial property provided the overhead line extension is placed underground at the closest feasible point to the property line and does not attach directly to any structure on the property; and 
(5)  Underground utility lines being installed, relocated or upgraded within the city shall be located in accordance with standard drawings 303 and 304 in the "DESIGN STANDARDS" section at the rear of the [this] land development ordinance. Those utilities being placed along publicly owned and maintained rights-of-way shall follow drawing number 303. Those utilities being placed along privately owned and maintained streets shall follow drawing number 304. Exceptions may be granted by the city engineer with the concurrence of the utility company or companies involved. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 707.1. - Marking standards for underground utilities. 
I.  Definitions. The following words are to be understood consistent with the definitions contained herein as applicable to this article: 
(a)  Emergency means a sudden or unforeseen occurrence involving a clear and imminent danger to life, health, or property; the interruption of utility services; or repairs to transportation facilities that require immediate action. 
(b)  Extraordinary circumstances means circumstances other than normal operating conditions which exist and make it impractical or impossible for a facility owner or operator to comply with the provisions of this article. Such extraordinary circumstances may include, but shall not be limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, ice and snow, and acts of God. 
II.  White lining. 
(a)  Background. White lining is a practice that has been widely used in the United States where the National Transportation Board concluded that pre-marking is a practice that helps prevent excavation damage. The procedure simply involves an excavator using white paint to indicate the route or area that is going to be excavated, such that the locator then knows exactly how much marking is required and where. White lining reduces confusion about what utilities need to be marked or not marked. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of white lining is to allow everyone involved with the dig site to know the exact location of the proposed excavation. White lining the excavation site is an excellent way to assist the utilities or utility locators in marking lines in the work area right the first time and in less time. This technique eliminates speculation by the locator about where the excavation will take place and will often enable the utility or its agent to locate faster and more accurately. In short, pre-marking the area and the extent of the intended excavation can reduce delays and the time it takes to perform the locate. 
(c)  Examples; timing. Examples of areas to be white lined are smaller (involving only a portion of a particular address) or linear excavations such as telecommunication drops and lines, service lines (such as for water, gas, electricity and sewer), utility pits, cuts and repairs, curb repairs, bore holes, directional boring pathways, pole and signage placements, etc. Such examples are merely explanatory of the type of excavation where white lining is appropriate and are not meant to be exclusive. White lining shall be completed prior to contacting GA811 to obtain a locate request ticket number. Electronic/virtual white lining is not an acceptable or recognized method. 
(d)  Exceptions to white lining. Exceptions are allowed as follows: 
(1)  Unless one or more utility facilities are damaged five times or more collectively by a contractor making the locate request within a 90-day contract period, white lining will not be required for any large project so designated in accordance with GPSC Rule 515-9-4-.13 (a copy of GPSC Rule 515-9-4-.13 currently in effect is attached as Exhibit "A" and by this reference is incorporated herein). A large project ticket holder whose past prohibits it from being exempt, as stated above, will be subject to no more than a two-day shutdown period and shall be required to white line the remainder of the project to meet the Large Project Marking Facility Locating Agreement Schedule that the ticket holder and utility originally agreed upon; 
(2)  Homeowners/occupants involved in excavation or land disturbance that is confined to a single address or parcel. Homeowners/occupants shall not submit locate requests for excavation or land disturbance that will be performed by a business, a contractor, or a utility. Businesses, contractors, and utilities are not exempt from white lining; 
(3)  "Emergencies" and "extraordinary circumstances" as such terms are defined herein, are statutory exceptions to the requirement for obtaining a locate ticket prior to commencing mechanized excavation and, hence, also exceptions to the requirement for white lining under this section. However, if a particular emergency notification is later determined not to have been an emergency or an extraordinary circumstance, then the excavator's failure to procure a locate ticket before excavating will be treated as a violation of this section. Also, pre-excavation emergency locate ticket requests (that is, a request for a locate ticket on an expedited basis sooner than the prescribed time limit) will not be an exception to white lining as required in this section; 
(4)  Residential telecommunication service drop lines that can be delineated by the route of the existing line on the ground for single residential address/parcel requests only; and 
(5)  Termite baiting systems. 
(e)  White lining symbols as directions to locator. White lining proposed dig sites that will follow a single path or trench shall be marked using white lines and/or arrows and shall be located for 20 feet on either side of the white line and for 20 feet outward beyond the designated "START" and "END" of such linear white line. Therefore, it is important to identify the starting and ending points. 

(f)  Identification of white lining excavator. In order to enable the locating utility or its locators to quickly identify the requested locate at the job site and expedite the locating process, such excavator when white lining shall identify himself or itself by labeling the white line area with the excavator's name or the applicable locate ticket number or both. 
III.  Facility marking by or for utilities. 
(a)  Utility markings. Facility owners or their locate contractors shall indicate utility facilities by placing their UPC alpha code, along with the type material (if known) that the facility consists of, at the beginning and end of locates. Also, arrows should be placed at the ends of markings to indicate that the underground facility continues. In accomplishing the locate task, the line locator shall use industry-approved and generally accepted methods of locating. The tolerance zone shall be 24 inches measured horizontally from the outer edge of either side of such marked utility facilities. 
(1)  To avoid confusion on long runs, the marks shall be frequent enough to identify the owner. 
(2)  The marks shall indicate the approximate center-line of the underground lines. For example, the middle of the cable, line or pipe shall be at the center of the dashed marks. 
(3)  Location marks shall be four to 12 inches in length and at intervals of five to ten feet. 

(4)  The line locator (person marking the lines) shall extend marks outside the proposed work area by 20 to 30 feet if those facilities extend outside the proposed excavation area. 

(5)  In areas such as flower beds, rock gardens, etc., flags or stakes may be an alternative to paint. The decision to use flags, paint, or stakes shall be based on the terrain and job conditions. For instance, flags or stakes in wet areas, offsets in dirt construction zones that have a high volume of traffic crossing their line location marks. 

(6)  Dead ends, stub-outs, termination points, etc., shall be marked as follows: 

(7)  Lines that have connections (e.g., T's or Y's) or changes in directions shall be clearly indicated. Marks indicating lines or connections shall clearly show the intersection and path of the line or connection. Marks that show changes in direction shall be placed closer together for more clarity and accuracy. 

(8)  Manholes and valves shall be identified by using a circle and letters if they are not visible (dirt covering valve boxes or pavement covering manhole cover). 

(9)  Facilities that cross but do not intersect shall be marked as described to indicate such installation manner. 

(10)  Unlocateable sewer laterals shall be marked by placing a green triangle on the sewer main and, if the location of the tap for such unlocateable sewer lateral is known, by placing a green "T" or "Y" or other appropriate symbol at the tap pointing generally toward the address served by such unlocateable sewer lateral. 

(11)  When facilities share the same trench, they shall be heavily identified and separated enough so that they can be readily identified. This would apply to lines that share the same color code. For example, cable television and telephone lines: 

(12)  If the facility to be marked has a diameter greater than 12 inches, the size of the facility shall be indicated if known. If the size is not known, then the mark shall indicate greater than 12 inches. 
(13)  Duct structures shall be marked by using a dot with parallel boundary on each side of the dot. 

(14)  In areas where there is a strong likelihood that any or all marker types showing line location would be destroyed, offsets shall be placed on a permanent surface. However, offsets should be used only in conjunction with marks placed above a facility. Offset spacing should be every third or fourth mark. For example, the following mark would indicate the line is 16 feet from the end of the arrow. 

(15)  In areas where cables are spliced, the facilities should be located individually as far as possible on both sides of the splice. When the signal is distorted due to the near proximity to the splice a circle with "SP" should indicate the area of distortion or "splice pit".

DIVISION 2. - STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION DESIGN 

Sec. 709. - Suitability of land. 
Land that is subject to flooding, improper drainage or erosion or that is for topographical or other reasons unsuitable for development use shall not be platted for any use that will continue or increase the danger to health or safety, unless the hazards are first corrected. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 710. - Name of subdivision. 
The name of the subdivision must be approved by the planning commission, and it shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 711. - Access. 
Access to every subdivision shall be provided by way of a public or private street. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 712. - Parks, playgrounds and recreation areas. 
(a)  Recreation standards. The city shall require that land be reserved for parks and playgrounds or other recreation purposes by the developer of each single-family subdivision or multifamily development in locations designated on the master plan or where such reservations would otherwise be appropriate. Each reservation shall be of suitable size, dimension, topography, and general character and shall have adequate street access for the particular purposes envisioned by the planning commission. Those areas shall be shown and marked on the final plat, "Reserved for park and/or recreation purposes." When recreation areas are required, the planning commission shall determine the number of acres to be reserved basing that determination upon the premises that three acres of recreation for every 100 dwelling units is required. The planning commission shall refer such proposed reservations to the local government official or department in charge of parks and recreation for their recommendations. The developer shall dedicate all such recreation areas to the city government as a condition of final subdivision plat approval. 
(b)  Minimum size of park and playground reservations. Land reserved for recreation purposes should normally be an area of at least four acres. When procedure contained in (a) above would yield less than four acres, the commission may require that the recreation area be located at a suitable place on the edge of the subdivision so that additional land may be added at such time as adjacent land is subdivided. In no case shall an area of less than two acres be reserved for recreation purposes. 
(c)  Alternative procedure. 
(1)  Money in lieu of land. Where, with respect to a particular single-family subdivision or multifamily development, the reservation of land required pursuant to this section does not equal the percentage of total land required to be reserved, the city shall require, prior to preliminary plat or final site plan approval, that the applicant deposit with the city clerk a cash payment in lieu of land reservation. Such deposit shall be used by the city for improvement of neighborhood park, playground, or recreation areas including the future acquisition of property. The planning commission shall determine the amount to be deposited, based on the following formula of $500.00 multiplied by the number of dwelling units proposed for the residential development less a credit for the amount of land actually reserved for recreation purposes, if any; as the land reserved bears in proportion to the land required for reservation. 
(2)  Public facility in lieu of land and/or money. 
a.  A facility (e.g., passive park, playground, swimming pool, tennis courts, ball field, etc.) may be constructed in lieu of the designated land requirements as determined by this section. Such facilities must be of equal or greater value than the designated requirements, and must be approved by the city council. 
b.  Facilities constructed in greenbelt areas may qualify for partial credit of land in lieu of money. The following credits shall be permitted: 
1.  Greenbelts required by this article—No credit. 
2.  Greenbelts with cart paths—One-third credit. 
3.  Greenbelts with cart paths, including improvements such as: picnic tables, picnic grills, picnic shelters, etc.—Two-thirds credit. 
4.  Greenbelt areas that include larger recreational areas (e.g., the three recreation ponds in Braelinn Village)—Full credit. 
In order to receive any credit for cart paths in any greenbelt area, the cart path must extend over or through a minimum of 75 percent of the greenbelt area measured along the longest boundary. 
Acceptance of the proposed public greenbelts by the planning commission will be a condition of final plat or final site plan approval. The developer shall complete the greenbelt improvements within an appropriate and reasonable time period established between the developer and the planning commission but in no event later than one year after final plat or final site plan approval. 
(d)  Recreation needs. A developer who is developing a portion of his holdings may propose an overall plan for recreation needs. The planning commission shall review the plan. If the plan conforms to the intent and purpose of this article, the planning commission may accept the plan as the recreational need plan for the designated area. As the developer develops portions of the designated area, he shall submit a letter describing how he is satisfying the requirements of the plan. 
(e)  Notes. If the land to be reserved is located other than shown on the final plat, then appropriate notes as to size, location and other identifying data shall be shown on the final plat being approved. 
(f)  Other recreation reservations. 
(1)  The provisions of this section are minimum standards. None of the paragraphs above shall be construed as prohibiting a developer from reserving other land for recreation purposes in addition to that required by this section. 
(2)  When subdivisions or developers provide private recreational areas and facilities, partial credit may be given to meet the requirements set forth in this section. The planning commission will apply the formula described in section 705(c)(1) ($500.00 per dwelling unit) on an equal basis with the private facility subject to a maximum of one-half credit of total amount required by the formula of $500.00 per dwelling unit. The developer shall complete the private recreational facilities within an appropriate and reasonable time period established between the developer and the planning commission but in no event shall the period exceed one year from final plat on final site plan approved. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 713. - Easements. 
Easements, where required, shall have a minimum width of ten feet. The city engineer may require sewer easements in subdivisions not currently served by a sewer system if, in his opinion, the subdivision may some day be served by a sewer system. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage easement subject to approval by the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 714. - Special screening. 
Special screening shall be required of all commercial and multifamily subdivisions or developments on the sides that abut streets or single-family residential subdivisions, and the applicable setback areas of multiple frontage lots in single-family residential subdivisions. The intent of this special screening requirement is to hinder the view of the screened structure from the abutting single-family residential subdivision and/or to provide an area between street and commercial area. The area between street and commercial area shall be at least ten feet wide and shall run from property line to property line except for the ingress and egress areas and shall be included on the landscape plan.

(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 722. - Scenic roads. 
(a)  Scenic roads, as defined by this article, may be established from time to time by the city council upon the recommendation of the planning commission. 
(b)  If any road, or section of a road, within the city is proposed for scenic road status, an application shall be made to the city planner. This application shall follow the form and content of an application for a limited use commercial zoning classification. Also this application shall be administered in accordance with the requirements for a limited use commercial rezoning proposal. 
(c)  Only those roads classified as arterials, major collectors, and minor collectors are eligible for scenic road status.

That plan must include the specific construction, maintenance, and landscape standards that will apply to the road and the adjoining property. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 723. - Buffer standards for major thoroughfares. 
In order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, the city has determined that buffer standards need to be adopted and enforced for the property along its major thoroughfares. These standards are intended to promote an orderly development process by setting forth specific standards to be consistently applied to all building sites along major thoroughfares; they are intended to maintain and enhance the aesthetic standards that have already been established as a part of the city's streetscape; they are intended to ameliorate air quality and water runoff problems; they are intended to help reduce traffic congestion and unsafe driving conditions; and they are intended to encourage an orderly pattern of planned development along all the major traffic arteries in the city, as opposed to the sprawl and strip commercial development that typically characterizes unplanned development without proper buffer standards. 
The buffer standards have been established for the four main categories of major thoroughfares: arterial highways, community collector roads, village collector roads, and scenic roads. The specific thoroughfares within each of these categories are identified, standards are presented for both residential and nonresidential land uses along the thoroughfares, and special conditions and exceptions are presented for each classification. 
723.1 Arterial highways. 
There are two arterial highways in Peachtree City: SR 54 and SR 74. The following buffer standards shall apply to all residential and nonresidential development along these highways: 
(a)  Residential buffers. A continuous 100-foot-wide (minimum) city-owned greenbelt buffer shall be established for any residential development adjacent to an arterial highway. 
(b)  Nonresidential buffers. A continuous 60-foot-wide tree-save/landscape buffer shall be established for any nonresidential development adjacent to an arterial highway. 
(c)  Special conditions and exceptions. 
(1)  The required tree-save/landscape buffer for any nonresidential property may be reduced as follows, subject to the approval of the city landscape architect and the planning commission: 
a.  A buffer may be reduced from 60 feet to 50 feet, provided the developer installs additional landscaping that amounts to at least ten percent of the caliper inches of the trees required for the entire site by the landscape ordinance. 
b.  A buffer may be reduced from 60 feet to 40 feet, provided the developer installs additional landscaping that amounts to at least 20 percent of the caliper inches of the trees required for the entire site by the landscape ordinance. 
(2)  The buffer requirements for paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall not apply to any existing developed lot adjacent to an arterial highway unless the zoning of the property is changed or there is a major change in the intensity of the existing use.

For these lots, the minimum buffer shall be not less than 20 feet wide. 
(4)  For any existing platted lot which is adjacent to an arterial highway and which has an average depth of between 200 feet and 220 feet (measured from the right-of-way line of the adjacent arterial highway), the required buffer width may be established at 20 feet plus the number of feet the average depth of the lot exceeds 200 feet. This means that the depth of a buffer for these lots could range from 20 feet minimum to 40 feet maximum. 
(5)  The buffer requirements for paragraphs (a) and (b) above may be reduced by ten feet if a nonresidential lot is located between an arterial highway and a parallel service road and if a tree-save/landscape buffer at least 30 feet wide is established adjacent to the service road. 
(6)  For lots that front on an arterial highway and have a second or third frontage on another arterial highway, community collector road, village collector road, or scenic road, the respective buffer standards for each of the adjacent major thoroughfares shall apply.

(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
DIVISION 4. - STANDARDS FOR RETAIL, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUILDING DESIGN 

Sec. 724. - Applicability. 
The intent of these standards is to enhance the visual appearance of the community as a whole, as well as the commercial appeal of individual establishments. The mission or intent of this requirement is to adopt design standards which, over time, will establish a streetscape and image that will make the city unique to surrounding jurisdictions, establishes a unifying theme, presents the traveling public with a sense of arrival, is harmonious with its surrounds, is aesthetically pleasing and enhances the character of the community. 
As such, the following goals, at a minimum, are established: 
(a)  To encourage the rehabilitation/ redevelopment of commercial areas. 
(b)  To reinforce and promote the established "village center" planning concept and associated retail and commercial development. 
(c)  To facilitate and encourage safe, attractive, and convenient pedestrian circulation and alternate forms of transportation within a development, along a corridor and throughout the community. 
(d)  To promote and encourage new development to be compatible in both scale and character with adjoining developments. 
(e)  To use landscaping techniques to soften the effect and blend each development with the surrounding areas. 
(f)  To further energy conservation and stormwater management through better design. 
(g)  To ensure that quality development throughout the city is obtained. 
Development or redevelopment of all retail, commercial, office and/or industrial tracts lying within 500 feet of the centerline of SR 74 or SR 54, or within 500 feet of the centerline of any scenic road, community or village collector as defined by this ordinance, shall comply with the requirements of this article. 
Each new development and/or changes to existing development located within these areas shall be reviewed by the planning commission for conformance with these guidelines. There shall be no alteration of the existing condition of land, uses, structures, landscaping or lighting within these areas without approval of the planning commission. However, if a proposed development will not be visible from the road once the project is completed, the planning commission may waive review of the development. 
The compatible relationship of each development within these areas is of critical public concern for any building or site enhancements. The intent of the design review is not to stifle innovative site planning, engineering, or architectural design but to assure respect for and reduce incompatible and adverse impacts on the visual experience. The planning commission shall base their review on the guidelines established herein as the sole basis for their review. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 725. - Architectural design. 
The design of all structures, walls, fences, signs, light fixtures and accessory buildings shall be unobtrusive and of a design, material and color that blend harmoniously with the natural surroundings, and the scale of neighboring architecture, complying with the intent of this section. Innovative, high quality design and development is strongly encouraged to enhance property values and long-term economic assets along designated corridors. 
Diversity of architectural design is highly encouraged. However, multiple buildings on the same site or within the same development should be designed to create a cohesive visual relationship between the buildings. 
Franchise architecture for single or multiple buildings within a development should be avoided in order to create buildings that complement one another. Franchise architecture is defined as building design that is trademarked or identified with a particular franchise, chain or corporation and is generic or standard in nature. Franchises or national chains should follow the standards of this article to create a building that is compatible with the development in which it is located, utilizing similar architectural design, building materials or color selections to blend in with the surrounding development. 
Architectural design should be compatible with the developing character of the neighboring area. Design compatibility includes complementary building style, form, size, color, materials, and detailing. The architect should consider each of the following contexts as part of the design process: 
(a)  Size (the relationship of the project to its site); 
(b)  Scale (the relationship of the building to those around it); 
(c)  Massing (the relationship of the building's various parts to each other); 
(d)  Fenestration (the placement of windows and doors); 
(e)  Rhythm (the relationship of fenestration, recesses and projections); 
(f)  Setback (in relation to setback of immediate surroundings); 
(g)  Materials (their compatibility with the surrounding developments); and, 
(h)  Context (the overall relationship of the project to its surroundings). 
Buildings should incorporate alcoves, arcades, awnings, covered walkways, porticoes or roofs that protect pedestrians from the rain and sun. In addition, when appropriate, buildings should incorporate changes in mass, surface, lighting or finish to emphasize entranceways. 
Blank walls that can be seen from any street (public or private) are prohibited. Walls shall have offsets, jogs, or other distinctive changes in the building facade. Long or continuous wall planes shall be avoided, particularly in pedestrian activity areas, where buildings should exhibit more detail and elements appropriate for close range pedestrian view. 
The height of proposed buildings should be coordinated with the height of adjoining structures, especially where buildings will be located very close to each other. It is often possible to adjust the height of a wall, cornice, or parapet line to match that of an adjacent building. Similar design linkages, such as window lines, should be placed in a pattern that reflects the same elements on neighboring buildings. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 726. - Building height and massing. 
The height of proposed buildings should be coordinated with the height of adjoining structures, especially where buildings will be located very close to each other. It is often possible to adjust the height of a wall, cornice, or parapet line to match that of an adjacent building. Similar design linkages, such as window lines, should be placed in a pattern that reflects the same elements on neighboring buildings. 
The massing of a building can be defined as the overall geometry (length, width and height) of its perceived form. Massing is a significant factor that contributes to establishing the character of a specific building. Of particular importance in defining the massing of a building is the overall height of the form, both actual and perceived, as well as the geometry of the roof. 
In order to reduce the apparent bulk of multi-story buildings and maintain pedestrian scale by providing a sense of "base," "middle," and "top", the following guidelines must be met: 
(a)  Top: The "top" of the building shall emphasize a distinct profile or outline with elements such as projecting parapets, cornices, upper level setbacks, or pitched rooflines. 
(b)  Middle: The middle of the building must be made distinct by change in building materials and/or color, windows, balconies, recessed panels, step backs, or other decorative features. The middle of a building typically consists of a pattern of upper-story windows. 
(c)  Base: Buildings shall have a distinct "base" at the ground level by using articulation and materials such as stone, masonry, or decorative concrete. Distinction of the base may also be defined by windows, alcoves, water tables, a change in materials, texture or color, building overhangs, canopies, awnings, or other architectural elements. For multi-story buildings, a base may be one story tall, defined by a storefront, a cornice, or a change in materials. 
The facades of all buildings shall be proportionally divided using architectural elements including windows and entries in conjunction with porches, arcades, and awnings. Any wall surface over 30 feet in length should include at least one change in plane. Larger buildings shall be divided into bays of 25 to 40 foot widths. Bays can be articulated by pilasters, piers, differentiation in material, texture, or color, or by variation in the wall plane. 
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 937, § 1, adopted February 21, 2008, repealed the former §§ 726—730 and enacted new provisions in lieu thereof. Formerly, §§ 726—730 pertained to exterior building materials and architectural elements, exterior color selection, primary color(s), accent colors, and awnings, respectively, and derived from Ord. No. 884, adopted May 18, 2006. 
Sec. 727. - Exterior building materials and architectural elements. 
All sides of a building may have an impact on adjoining developments and should be considered for treatment with an architectural finish of primary materials (i.e., brick, wood and stone), unless other materials demonstrating equal or greater quality are used. As a general rule, front facades should be at least 80 percent brick and/or stone. Side facades should be at least 50 percent brick and/or stone. Rear facades do not have a minimum requirement for primary materials and can consist entirely of secondary materials (e.g., stucco). Tertiary materials (i.e., wood and metal) should be used for decorative elements and trim only. 
The following types of building materials should not be used on any part of the exterior of a building exposed to public view: 
(a)  Metal building without a masonry base course or other architectural features; 
(b)  Prefabricated steel panels; 
(c)  Highly reflective, shiny, or mirror-like materials; 
(d)  Mill-finish (non-colored) aluminum metal windows or doorframes; 
(e)  Aluminum, vinyl or fiberglass siding or roofing materials; 
(f)  Unfaced or painted concrete block; 
(g)  Pre-cast concrete panels or exposed, unfinished foundation walls; 
(h)  Exposed plywood or particle board; 
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Editor's note— See note at section 726. 
Sec. 728. - Exterior color selection. 
Material or color changes generally should occur at a change of plane. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in material and/or color selections will be avoided. 
Facade colors should be low reflectance, and subtle, neutral, or earth-tone colors. High-intensity colors, metallic colors, black, or fluorescent colors should not be used. 
Building colors should be carefully chosen so that each building color complements that of its neighbors. Colors can be classified as the "base" color (used on the majority of the building surface), "trim" color (used on the window trim, fascia, balustrades, and posts), and "accent" color (used on signs, awnings, and doors). The base color should consist of more subdued earth tones or brick shades. Trim colors should have contrasting lighter or darker shade than the base color. If natural brick is used, it should not be painted. 
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Editor's note— See note at section 726. 
Sec. 729. - Primary color(s). 
A maximum of three predominant colors should be designated as a primary unifying element. Accent colors should not be considered predominant colors. Flexibility may be used to allow additional colors and/or a range of predominant colors provided that these colors are in the same family of colors or are similar to each other. Any color specified as a primary unifying element shall be dominant in the building facade. 
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Editor's note— See note at section 726. 
Sec. 730. - Accent colors. 
Accent colors may be used as a secondary unifying element provided they are used throughout the development. 
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Editor's note— See note at section 726. 
Sec. 730.1. - Awnings. 
The use of awnings on buildings is encouraged to provide protection from sun, wind, and rain, and to improve aesthetics of the building exterior. It is recommended that awnings be constructed with a durable frame, covered by a canvas material. Aluminum and other metal canopies are acceptable in most instances, particularly when integrated into shopping center designs. 
Solid colors are preferred over striped awnings, but striping is permitted if colors complement the character of the structure or group of buildings. 
Awnings are encouraged for first floor retail uses to provide architectural interest and to encourage pedestrian activity. Where awnings are used, they should be designed to coordinate with the design of the building and any other awnings along the same block face. Awnings on second floor windows can be used to soften the appearance of a particular elevation or to assist in reducing the scale of the overall building. 
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-21-2008) 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 937, § 1, adopted February 21, 2008, enacted provisions intended for use as § 731. Inasmuch as there are already provisions so designated, and the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been redesignated as § 730.1. See note at section 726. 
DIVISION 5. - STANDARDS FOR LIGHTING DESIGN 

Sec. 731. - Building and site lighting. 
All exterior lighting should be architecturally compatible with the building style, material, and color selections. Architectural and shoebox style cutoff fixtures shall be used in all parking areas as opposed to cobra type light fixtures and directional floodlights. Exterior lighting of the building and site should be designed so that light is not directed off the site, and the light source is shielded from direct offsite viewing. All outdoor light fixtures should be fully shielded or be designed or provided with light angle cut-offs, so as to eliminate uplighting, spill light, and glare. 
Exterior architectural, display and decorative lighting visible from the designated corridors shall be generated from a concealed light source with low-level fixtures. Any lighting fixture used to illuminate parking areas, access drives or loading areas shall be of such design, so as to minimize the amount of ambient lighting perceptible from adjacent properties. In no case shall any lighting impair the vision of motorists on the corridor. 
Entrances into developments from the designated corridors may be lighted for traffic safety reasons, provided such lighting does not exceed the applicable footcandle requirements specified below. Excessive illumination of signage, buildings, or site features should be avoided. Roof lighting and down-lighting washing the building walls are strongly discouraged. 
731.1. Mounting height. 
Fixture mounting height should be appropriate for the project and the setting. The overall height of all lighting within parking lots should not exceed 30 feet in height from finish grade to the top of the light fixture. Lower mounting heights are encouraged where sites are located adjacent to residential areas or other sensitive land uses. Use of low, bollard-type fixtures that are three to four feet in height, are encouraged as pedestrian area lighting. 
731.2. Light fixtures. 
All light fixtures should be a cutoff luminaire whose source is completely concealed with opaque housing and should not be visible from any street. This provision includes lights on mounted poles, as well as architectural display and decorative lighting visible from the corridor. Fixtures should be mounted in such a manner that the cone of light is not directed at any property line of the site. Only incandescent, fluorescent, metal halide, mercury vapor or color corrected high-pressure sodium light may be used. The same type of lighting must be utilized for all fixtures and light sources on the site. 
731.3. Illumination levels. 
All site lighting should be designed so that the level of illumination measured in footcandles (fc) at any one point meets the standards below. The planning commission shall have the discretion to allow limited flexibility as to variations in the minimum and average levels, if the proposed levels are below the following standards. The planning commission shall not allow flexibility for proposed levels which exceed the maximum levels, unless such levels strictly conform to the recommended levels within the IESNA Lighting Handbook. 

 
Lighting underneath canopies for service stations or similar uses shall be restricted to no more than two 320-watt recessed lighting fixtures (including lenses) mounted flush with the bottom of the canopy on each side of a gasoline pump or other design that meets the standards of this chapter. Lighting for canopies for service stations and other similar uses shall not exceed an average of 12 fc as measured at the ground level at the inside of the outside edge of the canopy. Lighting for ATM machines shall be recessed and mounted flush with the actual canopy above the ATM machine and shall comply with the latest requirements identified within the IESNA Lighting Handbook or established by federal regulations. 
Decorative wall packs may be used only at service entrances to buildings and shall not be used to draw attention to the building or provide general building or site lighting. Wall packs on the exterior of a building shall be shielded (full cut-off type bulb or light source not visible from off-site) to direct light downward and be of low wattage (100 watts or lower). 
Illumination of all monument signage shall be by an externally located steady light source, which is shielded and directed solely at the sign. The intensity of the light shall not exceed 20 fc at any one point on the sign face. Colored lamps are not permitted. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 732. - Electrical streetlighting. 
(a)  Electrical streetlighting shall be installed in all subdivisions. 
(b)  Adequate streetlighting shall be determined and approved by the city planner during the approval of a preliminary plat. One copy of the approved streetlighting plan shall be forwarded to the electrical utility company servicing the subdivision. 
(c)  The developer shall provide adequate lighting at street intersections, and dead-end streets including culs-de-sac, and all at-grade cart paths crossing with collectors or arterial. 
(d)  As a minimum, luminaires are to be mounted at least 16 feet above grade. As a maximum, luminaires are to be mounted not more than 28 feet above grade. Adjustment in spacing and luminaire height may be made due to street curves, topography and natural foliage and type of equipment. A design within the range of the minimum and maximum shall be considered for approval that produces the effective horizontal illumination of 0.2 footcandle. 
(e)  Poles, fixtures and all related materials must be available standard stock items through the electric utility company servicing the subdivision or must be approved by the city planner. 
(f)  The developer shall pay the cost of installing the streetlights to the city planner and forwarding it on to city clerk during or before final plat approval. The city clerk shall forward the payment to the utility. 
(g)  The city will accept monthly charges for street light units on public property after negotiation and contract with the utility company following satisfactory implementation of subsections (a) through (f) above. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
DIVISION 6. - SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 733. - Submittal requirements. 
As a part of the conceptual site plan submittal, the applicant shall be required to provide the following information to the city planner for review and distribution to the planning commission for consideration: 
(a)  Schematic architectural elevations for all buildings or a set of design guidelines that include the unifying elements that are to be incorporated within the overall project (including each outparcel); 
(b)  Identification of primary physical characteristics of each building including predominant color(s), exterior materials and architectural features;

Colored renderings may be required, but shall not be a substitute for this requirement. In addition to listing the color(s), the design guidelines shall also describe how and where the color will be used. It is recognized that the same color on a different material may not match exactly. 
A lighting plan shall be required for all non-single family residential developments of one acre or more in size. When required, lighting plans shall illustrate all proposed lighting on a site and buildings. The plan should illustrate areas of night illumination and the amount of light at various places measured in footcandles (fc). When required, the lighting plans hall consist of either isofootcandles (connecting points of equal light illumination levels, similar to a topographic contour) or a photometric grid with individual spot readings). No lighting plan shall be approved which will result in direct light that exceeds the requirements or is other wise inconsistent with the provisions of this section. 
(Ord. No. 884, 5-18-2006) 
Sec. 734. - Requirements following project completion. 
The present owner and all subsequent owners of the property shall maintain all appearance features, lighting and landscaping approved by the planning commission. 
Changes beyond the owner's control shall be restored by the owner, unless otherwise provided. 
Any modifications to any element of the site plan, building design or lighting initially approved by the planning commission will require subsequent review and approval by the planning commission.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 990, § 1, adopted December 17, 2009, changed the title of section 803 from "Design standards" to "Design/construction standards." 
Sec. 804. - Multi-use path design standards. 
When required by the planning commission, multi-use paths shall be installed by the developer and shall comply to the following standards: 
(a)  The alignment of the path shall conform to the general plan for the area or as directed by the planning commission. The path shall be located a minimum of four feet from any property line except where located on an easement for access to a street or where unique topographical features warrant such location. Such locations must be noted on the preliminary plat. 
(b)  All new multi-use paths shall be constructed at a minimum of ten feet in width, and shall be constructed of two-inch 9.5 mm Superpave asphalt over a four-inch compacted, aggregate base. The aggregate base shall extend a minimum of 36 inches on either side of the multi-use path. A clearance zone measuring four feet in width × eight feet four inches in height shall be provided and maintained as measured from the edge of the path. (A detail of these path standards is found within Local Design Manual.) 
(c)  Where existing ground conditions require cross drainage under paths, the pipe size and alignment of the culverts shall be directed by the city engineer. 
(d)  After the paving is complete, the paths shall be inspected by the city engineer and any defects noted and the developer so notified of the deficiencies. Grassing and backfilling the edges of the path shall be included within the specifications.

The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 1005.4(c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 1005.4(b)(2) of this ordinance; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraphs (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
(i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
(ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
(i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
(ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970", and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to Code Section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to Code Section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shore line stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specification and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph, maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design, and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015, if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land-disturbance activities. 
(d)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit. 
(e)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Section 1005.4(b) and (c) of this ordinance. 
1005.5 Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal of the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the building department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the building department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 1005.5(c) of this ordinance. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 1005.4(b) and (c) of this ordinance will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three full-size printed copies and one 8½" × 11" reduced copy of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, and an appropriate and properly filled out Georgia EPD Erosion Sedimentation & Pollution Control Plan Checklist. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  A fee, shall be charged in the amount set forth in the current city fee schedule. 
(4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), one-half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to subsection O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 34 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 1005.4(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid and bonding, if required as per subsection 1005.5(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may require a bond as outlined in subsection 1005.5(b)(7) of this ordinance prior to approving the permit application. 
(7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 1005.4(b) and (c) of this ordinance, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation & Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with the ordinance, any variances required by subsections 1005.4(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 1005.5(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit, and plan shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this ordinance. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
1005.6 Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The engineering department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this section, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this section. 
(b)  This ordinance shall be amended to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The engineering department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
1005.7 Penalties and incentives. 
(a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this ordinance without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
(b)  Stop-work orders. 
(1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this ordinance, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have not more than five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that all site activities, including building construction that would not result in a safety issue, be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
(2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order for all site activities, including building construction that would not result in a safety issue, and may require an increase in the bond posted by the application to ensure compliance with the approved plan; and; 
(3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
(4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity, on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
(c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 1005.5(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
(d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this ordinance, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this section, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this ordinance shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this ordinance, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this ordinance under county ordinances approved under this section shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

(c)  Liability. 
(1)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this ordinance, nor the compliance with provisions of this ordinance shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
(2)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this section or the terms of the permit. 
(3)  No provision of this section shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby. 
(Ord. No. 791, 9-19-2002; Ord. No. 828, 5-6-2004; Ord. No. 998, § 1, 5-20-2010; Ord. No. 1122, § 1, 3-2-2017) 
Sec. 1006. - Drainage. 
(a)  Policies. It is hereby declared to be public policy to: 
(1)  Recognize the necessity of joint action where feasible by the city and the development industry in resolution of existing drainage problems and prevention of their worsening or recurrence. 
(2)  Work in a cooperative relationship with the development industry to accomplish the above-stated objective by encouraging through this section and other public actions; the development of fewer but larger major stormwater facilities; and the incremental resolution of existing drainage problems on a priority basis in concert with private development activities. 
(3)  Preserve, where feasible, the natural environment of city streams through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development, and where feasible, restore the floodplain to its natural functional purpose to resolve existing flooding problems, but recognize the necessity of using urban streams for water runoff in those situations where preservation of the natural stream environment would result in continuation or worsening of flooding conditions. 
(4)  Incrementally assume maintenance responsibility for the public drainage system on lands accepted by the city. 
(5)  Require of the development industry the responsibility to maintain the functioning of the storm drainage system during the development process. 
(6)  Encourage the construction of joint stormwater ponds serving several residential properties which can be accepted for maintenance by the city upon completion of project development. The city encourages (where engineering judgment so warrants) the location of these stormwater facilities off the site of the property under development and may participate where it is in the general public's best interest in the construction of major stormwater facilities which would serve not only the needs of the property under development, but would assist in resolving existing flooding problems. 
(7)  Encourage innovative design solutions to the effective control of runoff. 
(8)  Encourage accommodating runoff from residential properties or between individual single-family lots through underground piping rather than open surface drainage swales. 
(9)  Minimize cross drains from streets to natural drainageways by longitudinal piping or by retaining within the streets, for as long a reach as commonly accepted standards of engineering judgment permit, runoff to a point of discharge not directly onto individual single-family lots. 
(b)  Standards. 
(1)  All engineering design items for storm drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation control, and delineation of the intermediate regional floodplain shall meet the applicable minimum requirements of the Stormwater Design Manual and the Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia, available for review in the office of the city engineer. Rainfall intensities used in hydrologic computations shall not be less than shown by applicable rainfall curves published by the National Weather Service for the affected area. 
(2)  A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all development and construction disturbing more than 5,000 square feet of land or involving the installation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious surfaces. This storage and release requirement shall not apply to individual single-family lots of less than two acres which are not a part of a platted subdivision. 
(3)  The release rate of stormwater from all developments, where controlled release is required, shall be determined according to the requirements of the Stormwater Design Manual. 
(4)  The following requirements shall apply to the installation, development and maintenance of all stormwater and sedimentation control facilities designed for storage of stormwater runoff: 
a.  In residential subdivisions, these facilities shall be located on tracts of land, designated as city-owned greenbelt on the recorded plat, with sufficient area around the perimeter to provide access for maintenance purposes and shall be immediately adjacent to or be provided with an access easement to a public street. The access easement shall provide at least ten feet of width outside of above-ground obstructions including trees, headwalls, weirs, settling basins or other drainage structures. 
b.  Except as provided in (4)c., the property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the stormwater facilities during grading, construction, and following final approval of the completed project. This maintenance obligation shall be binding on future owners, successors and assigns of the property and be in accordance with all provisions of the Water Resource Protection Ordinance. 
c.  In the case of platted residential subdivisions, the city shall assume maintenance responsibility after the release of the maintenance agreement for subdivision streets. Upon completion of the maintenance agreement, all stormwater ponds shall have a positive slope to the outlet in order to facilitate complete drainage. 
(5)  Special drainage system maintenance requirements: 
a.  No impoundment of water which retains in excess of 0.5 acre-foot of runoff shall be altered without first obtaining a development permit, which shall only be issued after competent engineering studies provided by the developer show that this removal will not adversely affect downstream properties. 
b.  Trash, garbage, construction materials, construction by-products or other debris shall not be deposited in any part of the drainage system. 
c.  No restrictions or barriers, including fences, may be placed in the drainage system without first obtaining a development permit. 
(6)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

(1)  No development shall be allowed within any area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following: 
(a)  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
(b)  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
(c)  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or 
(d)  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
(2)  Any development within the area of future-conditions flood hazard allowed under subsection 1007.4.3(1) shall also meet the following conditions: 
(a)  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
(b)  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
(c)  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased;

The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of development, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys and plans for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). 
(3)  No development shall be allowed within any area located at or below the base flood elevation except for new multi-use paths and perpendicular road/path crossings. New paths or road crossings must also meet requirements of subsections 1007.4.3(1) and 1007.4.3(2) above. 
1007.4.4. Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. 
An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Peachtree City prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
(1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
(2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Peachtree City. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
(3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
(4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
1007.4.5. Floodway encroachments. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection 1007.4.5(2) below. 
(2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
(3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Peachtree City until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the City of Peachtree City. 
1007.4.6. Maintenance requirements. 
The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. The City of Peachtree City may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the City of Peachtree City. 
1007.5. Provisions for flood damage reduction. 
In all areas of special flood hazard and areas of future-conditions flood hazard the following provisions apply:

(Ord. No. 1091, § 1, 3-19-2015) 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 1091, § 1, adopted March 19, 2015, repealed and reenacted section 1007 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, section 1007 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 925, § 1, 1-17-2008; Ord. No. 942, § 1, 5-1-2008. 
Sec. 1008. - Groundwater recharge areas. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the City of Peachtree City and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that Peachtree City and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. 
(2)  Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
(b)  Establishment of the groundwater recharge area protection district. 
(1)  Establishment. The groundwater recharge area protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this section. 
(2)  Determination of pollution susceptibility. Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this section. 
(c)  Protection criteria. 
(1)  No construction may proceed on any building to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Human Resources, Manual for On-Site Sewage Management (hereinafter DHR Manual) and paragraph (2) below. 
(2)  New buildings served by a septic tank/drain field system shall be on lots having minimum size limitations as follows, based on application of Table MT-1 of the DHR Manual (hereinafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimums set forth in DHR Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A-F) of the DHR Manual. 
a.  One hundred fifty percent (150%) of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
b.  One hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
c.  One hundred ten percent (110%) of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
d.  In no event shall the minimum lot size for any building served by a septic tank/drain field system be less than one acre. 
(3)  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; a medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet; or a low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 X 10-7cm/sec or other criteria established by the natural resource and conservation service. 
(4)  New above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
(5)  New facilities that handle hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and which contain amounts of 10,000 gallons or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and local fire code requirements. 
(6)  Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility. 
(7)  Commercial and industrial operations, either new or existing, which require washing truck railroad cars (tanks or other load types) shall provide containment equal to 110 percent of the container volume as well as a treatment plan and appropriate equipment to handle an emergency. 
(d)  Exemptions. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of this section is exempt from the minimum lot size requirements contained in paragraph (d)(2)a., b., c., and d. above. 
(Ord. No. 791, 9-19-02) 
Sec. 1009. - Wetland protection. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  The wetlands in the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. 
(2)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
(3)  The purpose of this section is to promote wetlands protection while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. 
(b)  Establishment of the wetlands protection district. 
(1)  The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory Maps.

(Ord. No. 791, 9-19-2002) 
Sec. 1010. - Illicit discharges. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  The purpose of this ordinance is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Peachtree City through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable. This ordinance establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4). The objectives of this ordinance are: 
a.  To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user. 
b.  To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
c.  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this ordinance. 
(b)  Applicability. This ordinance shall apply to all water entering the storm drain system generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by Peachtree City. 
(c)  Administration. The community development director shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this ordinance. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the community development director may be delegated in writing by the community development director to persons or entities acting in the beneficial interest of or in the employ of Peachtree City. 
(d)  Severability. If the provisions of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this ordinance shall be judged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such order of judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this ordinance. 
(e)  Responsibility. The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this ordinance are minimum standards; therefore this ordinance does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants. 
(f)  Discharge prohibitions. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows. The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this ordinance: 
1)  Water line flushing or other potable water sources, non-commercial landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wet-land flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants. 
2)  Discharges specified in writing by the community development director as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 
3)  Dye testing provided that verbal notification is given to the agency prior to the time of the test. 
4)  Any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations 
(g)  Illicit connections. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is considered to be in violation of this ordinance if the person connects any system conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(h)  Suspension of MS4 Access. 
(1)  Emergency situations. Peachtree City may, without prior notice, suspend publicly-owned drainage system access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(2)  Detection of illicit discharges. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this ordinance may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The community development director will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city council for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the community development director. 
(i)  Industrial or construction activity discharges. Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to Peachtree City prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(j)  Discharge monitoring. 
(1)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges to the publicly owned storm drainage system. 
(2)  Access to facilities. 
a.  The community development director shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. If a discharger has security measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of Peachtree City. 
b.  Facility operators shall allow the community development director full access to all parts of the premises in order to inspect, sample, examine and copy records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and to perform any additional duties as required by state and federal law. 
c.  The community development director shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the developmental services director to monitor and/or sample the facility's stormwater discharge. 
d.  The community development director has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary, given that reasonable cause to believe that an illicit discharge or connection exists. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the discharger's own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy per the manufacturer's recommended standards. 
e.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly and permanently removed by the operator at the written or oral request of [the] community development director. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
f.  Unreasonable delay in allowing the community development director access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this ordinance. The operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if that person or an agent denies the community development director reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this ordinance. 
g.  If the community development director has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, then the community development director may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction upon showing that: 
i.  He/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance; 
ii.  Or, that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any order issued hereunder; 
iii.  Or, to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community. 
(k)  Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. Peachtree City may from time to time adopt requirements identifying best management practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility, which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. Prior to commencement of substantial improvements to the site, the owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with an industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWP3) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(l)  Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(m)  Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation who has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of a release of hazardous materials that person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, that person shall notify the community development director in person or by phone, facsimile or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the community development director within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years. 
(n)  Enforcement. 
(1)  Notice of violation. Whenever the community development director finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this ordinance, the community development director may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require of the violator without limitation: 
a.  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
b.  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
c.  The cessation of the violating discharges, practices, or operations; 
d.  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; 
e.  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and

Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be completed by a designated governmental agency or a contractor at the violator's expense. 
(o)  Appeals of notice of violation. Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the community development director. The notice of appeal must be received within ten days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the city council or his/her designee shall take place within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. 
Any person, aggrieved by a decision or order of the community development director, after exhausting administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal de novo to the superior court of Fayette County. 
(p)  Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within ten days of the decision of the review authority upholding the decision of the community development director, then representatives of the community development director may subsequent to written notice enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. 
(q)  Cost of abatement of the violation. Within 30 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. Within 30 days of the notice, the property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. 
(r)  Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this ordinance. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this ordinance, the community development director may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.

The following specific activities are exempt from this ordinance. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property. 
(1)  Activities for the purpose of building one of the following: 
-  A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line; 
-  Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures; 
-  Intrusions necessary to provide access to a property; 
-  Public access facilities that must be on the water including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the stream, (not meant to apply to lakes, only streams per the definition) fishing platforms and overlooks; 
-  Unpaved foot trails and paths; 
-  Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used. 
(2)  Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least 25 feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in item 4.2.(1), above. 
(3)  Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time this ordinance takes effect or approved under the terms of this ordinance. 
(4)  Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this ordinance takes effect or approved under the terms of this ordinance, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. 
(5)  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the city engineer on the next business day after commencement of the work.

1012.5.1 Buffer and setback requirements. 
All land development activity subject to this ordinance shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. 
(2)  An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 
(3)  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
1012.5.2 Variance procedures. 
Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this ordinance, and the city engineer finds and determines that the requirements of this ordinance prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the city council may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
(2)  Except as provided above, the city council shall grant no variance from any provision of this ordinance without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the city council. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship. 
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this ordinance, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
(3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and, 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
(4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and, 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment. 
1012.6 Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements. 
This ordinance is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this ordinance should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL 

Sec. 1101. - Purpose. 
Intent of article and declaration of public policy. The guiding presumption behind this article is the belief that the natural environment has significant value in and of itself, and that all reasonable measures available should be used in the preservation of that environment, consistent with the continued development of a viable Peachtree City. 
The city council, therefore, declares it to be public policy to: 
(a)  Aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the process of air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge, and stormwater runoff retardation, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare, and heat abatement. 
(b)  Assist in providing adequate light and air by preventing overcrowding of land. 
(c)  Provide visual buffering and enhance beautification of the city. 
(d)  Safeguard and attempt to enhance property values and, in so doing, protect private and public investment. 
(e)  Preserve, protect and further the unique identity and environment of the city, and, thereby, preserve the economic base attracted to the city by such factors. 
(f)  Recognize that the protection and enhancement of the natural beauty, environment, and greenspace within the city contributes to the economy, as well as provides a truly necessary aesthetic balance to the development of an urban setting. 
(g)  Conserve an ever-dwindling supply of energy, by the preservation and enhancement of the natural environment. 
(h)  Protect the atmosphere, lands, and water from pollution, impairment or unnecessary destruction. 
(i)  Protect natural vegetation except where its removal is necessary for responsible property development or control of disease and infestation. This article shall serve to dissuade the unnecessary clearing of land and its disturbance, so as to preserve, insofar as possible, the natural and existing growth of vegetation, and to replace whenever possible the removed foliage with new vegetation. 
(j)  Protect vegetation within the intermediate regional floodplain and for a minimum ten feet from the banks of those streams not having defined intermediate regional floodplain elevation contours, so as to assist in the retention of stormwater runoff and the control of erosion, including particularly the protection of stream bank stability by vegetation or restoration. 
(k)  Preserve protected and specimen trees or stands of trees which are exceptional representatives of their species either in terms of size, age or unusual botanical quality, and encourage the good care of same through properly applied forestry practices. 
(l)  Protect and supplement existing vegetation within greenbelts, open space, recreation areas, protected areas, and scenic roads where feasible. 
(m)  Encourage and promote the use of native and drought tolerant plant material on all development sites.

(c)  The plan shall provide no less than three caliper inches of canopy trees and no less than two caliper inches of understory trees for every 1,000 square feet of impervious surface on the overall site. 
Example: 
A development site contains 68,000 SF of impervious surface.  Divide 68,000 by 1,000, which equals 68.  Multiply 68 x 3 to determine the total caliper inches of canopy trees required. In this case, a total of 204 caliper inches of canopy trees must be provided.  Multiply 68 x 2 to determine the total caliper inches of understory trees required. In this case, a total of 136 caliper inches of understory trees must be provided. 
(1)  Each canopy tree shall be a minimum of two and one-half inches in caliper. 
(2)  Each deciduous understory tree shall be a minimum of two inches in caliper. 
(3)  Each multi-trunk tree used as understory trees shall have a minimum of three canes, each of which shall be a minimum of two inches in caliper. 
(4)  Each evergreen understory tree shall be a minimum of 15 gallons in size or a minimum of six feet in height above finish grade at the time of planting. 
(5)  Sizing and grading standards for all plant material shall comply with the latest edition of the American Standard for Nursery Stock as prepared by the American Association of Nurserymen and adopted by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI Z60.1). 
(d)  All areas not devoted to structures, parking, driveways, site development features or the preservation of natural vegetation shall be landscaped. 
(e)  Preservation of existing vegetation on a project site is highly encouraged. 
(1)  For those developments that designate and maintain tree save areas other than vegetation located within tree save and/or landscape buffers or areas identified for future development, the planning commission may permit up to a 25 percent reduction in the total number of trees required by this ordinance. Tree save areas must be identified on the final site plan and protected with a tree-save barrier during construction. No construction materials, construction debris, or equipment shall be permitted to be stored within the tree-save areas. 
Tree credit shall be determined as follows: 
Total SF of project site designated as undisturbed tree save area  Total SF of property x 100 = Potential tree credit (%) 
Example:  The total property area is 1.4 acres (60,984 SF).  The Applicant is proposing to designate 6,500 SF as a permanent tree save area. The potential tree credit is calculated as follows: 
(6,500/60,984) x 100 = 11% of potential tree save credit 
(2)  Special consideration may be given when specimen trees are preserved and protected on a project site. These trees shall be identified on the tree survey submitted as a part of the conceptual site plan review process and shall be inspected by the city landscape architect and/or a certified arborist to determine the health of the tree. 
In those instances where specimen trees are protected, the planning commission may consider a reduction in the total caliper inches of trees required by this ordinance. 
(f)  It is recommended, but not required, that all planting and lawn areas include an underground irrigation system with a programmable timer and operational rain shut-off device. 
(1)  If an underground irrigation system is not provided, a water source shall be provided no less than 100 feet from all planting areas. 
(2)  The property owner shall be responsible for insuring the plant material is properly watered.

ARTICLE XII. - TRAFFIC IMPACT[9] 

Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 724, adopted Nov. 4, 1999, renumbered art. XII, §§ 1201 and 1202 as art. XIII, §§ 1301 and 1302 and added a new art. XII, §§ 1201—1209 as herein set out. 

Sec. 1201. - Purpose and scope. 
The implementation of the master plan for the development of Peachtree City has been temporarily disrupted because of delays with the DOT project to improve GA 54 to a four-lane arterial thoroughfare between GA 74 and Coweta County. 
Therefore, in order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, it has been determined to be necessary to adopt the following traffic impact ordinance for the GA 54 corridor. The corridor is defined as all that property both north and south of GA 54 between GA 74 and Coweta County, and extending from the GA 54 right-of-way a distance of 6000 feet to the north and 6000 feet to the south. 
The traffic impact ordinance shall establish a minimum standard of traffic operations for the corridor and provide for an administrative process to assure that no development is undertaken that would result in a lowering of the level of traffic operations below that established minimum standard. 
This article shall remain in effect until the DOT highway improvements are under contract or upon the GDOT's refusal to issue further mitigation-project permits. 
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-99; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-99; Ord. No. 806, 4-17-03)

(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-99; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-99) 
Sec. 1203. - Traffic impact model. 
The city shall retain a traffic engineering consultant to prepare and maintain a traffic impact model for the corridor. The model will be based on the traffic conditions in the corridor at the time the article is adopted. The model will then be updated to reflect the impact of each new project that is subsequently approved for development in accordance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-99; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-99) 
Sec. 1204. - Acceptable standard of traffic operations. 
The minimum acceptable standard of traffic operations within the corridor shall be defined as follows: 
(a)  For an unsignalized intersection, the average total delay per vehicle shall not exceed 45 seconds. 
(b)  For a signalized intersection, the volume to capacity composite ratio shall not exceed 1.10; and the average total delay per vehicle shall not exceed 60 seconds. 
(c)  The delays referred to in (a) and (b) above shall be calculated according to the methodology described in the Highway Capacity Manual, as updated in 1994. 
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-99; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-99) 
Sec. 1205. - Traffic impact study. 
(a)  A traffic impact study shall be performed for any proposed new development project within the corridor that has access only from GA 54, or is otherwise located within the corridor on a street which ultimately only has access from GA54. 
(b)  A traffic impact study shall be performed for any proposed new development project outside the corridor, if that project will generate 100 or more peak-hour trips, as defined in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) publication, Traffic Access and Impact Studies for Site Development. 
(c)  A traffic impact study must be performed by a qualified traffic engineer. 
(d)  A traffic impact study must be prepared at the expense of the developer of a proposed project. 
(e)  A traffic impact study, if required, must be performed in accordance with the general guidelines recommended in the ITE publication, Traffic Access and Impact Studies for Site Development, unless otherwise specified in this article or as directed by the city. A traffic study must include the projected traffic from all previously approved projects that are not yet in place at the time of the study. The extent of the study area must be clearly defined by the developer and approved by the city prior to actually initiating the study. And the study must, as a minimum, include a thorough analysis of the A.M. and P.M. peak-hour traffic over the entire corridor. 
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-99; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-99) 
Sec. 1206. - Evaluation and determination. 
Each required traffic impact study will be evaluated by the city as to its technical accuracy and its impact on the established minimum standard of traffic operations in the corridor. The cost of this evaluation shall be reimbursed to the city by the developer; and each evaluation shall produce a determination that a proposed project either complies with the established standard or it does not comply. 
(a)  If it is determined that a proposed project complies with the established minimum standard of traffic operations for all intersections in the corridor, a development permit shall be issued for the project, provided it meets all other applicable city codes and ordinances. 
(b)  If it is determined that a proposed project will not comply with the established minimum standard of traffic operations at one or more intersections in the corridor, the developer may: 
(1)  Reach an agreement with the city on a plan to mitigate the negative impact the project will have on traffic in the corridor; or 
(2)  Delay implementation of the project until the thoroughfare capacity is increased in accordance with the DOT plans; or 
(3)  Delay implementation until traffic is reduced in the corridor by other capital improvements to the point where the proposed project is able to comply with the established minimum standard of traffic operations within the corridor. 
(c)  If a developer reaches an agreement with the city on a plan to mitigate the negative impact of a project in accordance with (b)(1) above, a development permit shall be issued for the project, provided the mitigation plan is fully implemented as a part of the permitted work, and provided the project, including the mitigation plan, meets all other applicable city codes and ordinances. 
(d)  If a developer delays implementation of a project until the thoroughfare capacity is increased in accordance with (b)(2) above, a development permit shall be issued for the project upon completion of the DOT improvement work, provided the project meets all other applicable city codes and ordinances. 
(e)  If a developer delays implementation of a project in accordance with (b)(3) above, a development permit shall be issued for the project upon completion of other capital improvements that reduce traffic in the corridor to the point where the project is able to comply with the established minimum standard of traffic operations within the corridor, provided the project meets all other applicable city codes and ordinances, as well as all other portions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-1999; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-1999) 
Sec. 1207. - Updating the model. 
Once an evaluation and determination are made by the city and a permit is issued based on that determination, the city's traffic engineering consultant shall update the traffic impact model to reflect that determination. The cost of updating the model shall be reimbursed to the city by the developer of the proposed development project. 
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-1999; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-1999) 
Sec. 1208. - Expiration of determination. 
(a)  For any project for which a traffic impact analysis is required by this article, a traffic impact determination must be issued prior to final site plan approval or preliminary plat approval. That determination shall expire if a developer fails to secure a development permit for the project within 90 days of the date the determination is made. 
(b)  A traffic impact determination shall expire if a developer fails to initiate construction on a project within 90 days of the issuance of a development permit. 
(c)  A traffic impact determination shall expire if a developer ceases work on a project for more than 60 consecutive days after a development permit is issued. 
(d)  If a traffic impact determination expires for any of the above reasons, the city's traffic engineering consultant shall re-adjust the traffic impact model to reflect that change; and the developer, if he wishes to pursue the proposed project, shall be required to repeat the entire analysis and evaluation process, and shall have no vested rights as a result of the expired determination.

(c)  There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or the intended development of the property which preclude the applicant from complying with this ordinance and that do not apply generally to other property in the same zoning district and which prevent the applicant from complying with existing regulations; 
(d)  The granting of such variance will not constitute the granting of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations on other property in the same zoning district; and 
(e)  The granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or general welfare nor injurious to property or improvements in the zone or neighborhood in which the property is located. 
(f)  The granting of such variance will not create inconsistencies with any objective of the comprehensive plan. 
If it is found that the request is not in conformance with these requirements or may possibly have an adverse effect on the surrounding area, the city council shall deny the request in writing, stating the reasons for the denial.
