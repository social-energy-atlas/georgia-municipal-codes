PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Hapeville, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code, as supplemented through November 7, 2000, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The Code has been divided into two parts, The Charter and Related Laws and The Code of Ordinances. Part I has been subdivided into subpart A, The Charter, and subpart B, Related Laws, and Part II has been further subdivided into subparts A, B and C, being General Ordinances, Environment, Health and Sanitation, and Planning and Development. The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged within each subpart in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter, Article and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of three parts separated by a dash. The figure before the first dash refers to the chapter number; the figure before the second dash refers to the article number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the article. Thus, the second section of chapter 2, article 2 is numbered 2-2-2, and the sixth section of chapter 5, article 3, is section 5-3-6. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and article, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 9-2-1 and 9-2-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 9-2-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, or in the case of chapters placed at the end of the title embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the chapter, article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared to be useful to either city personnel or the general public. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Mary Grace Tavel, Senior Legal Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Alice Shepard, Deputy City Clerk, Mike Rast, City Administrator, and Murray J. Weed, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2.108. - Same; signature; seal. 
In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary-treasurer of the authority. Either of such signatures on any coupons may be by facsimile signature of the chairman and the secretary-treasurer of the authority in accordance with the provision of applicable law. Any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. 
Sec. 2.109. - Same; negotiability.

In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state.

In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.

ARTICLE 6. - CODE OF ETHICS 

Sec. 2-6-1. - Intent. 
(a)  Declaration of policy. The proper operation of democratic government requires that the mayor and council, city committees, boards, panels, public officials and city employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there is established a code of ethics for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. The purpose of this code is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the city. The provisions and purpose of this code of ethics and such rules and regulations as may be established are declared to be in the best interests of the city. This code of ethics shall apply to all officials, employees and members of boards and commissions, task forces, panels, and authorities of the city. 
(b)  Responsibilities of public office. Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state and municipality, and thus to foster respect for all government. They are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office, regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their primary concern. 
(c)  Procurement of qualified leaders. It is also essential to the proper operation of government that those best qualified be encouraged to serve the government. Accordingly, legal safeguards against conflicts of interest must be so designed as not unnecessarily or unreasonably to impede the recruitment and retention by the city of those men and women who are best qualified to serve. An essential principle underlying the staffing of our government structure is that its elected officials and employees should not be denied the opportunity, available to all other citizens, to acquire and retain private economic and other interests, except where conflicts with the responsibility of such elected officials and employees to the public cannot be avoided. 
(d)  Dedicated service. 
(1)  All officials and employees of the municipality should be loyal to the objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to attain those objectives. Appointed officials and employees should adhere to the rules of work and performance established as the standard for their positions by the appropriate authority. 
(2)  Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach the law or ask others to do so, and they should work in full cooperation with other public officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by the officially recognized confidential nature of their work. 
(e)  Distribution of code. The city administrator is authorized and directed to have such number of said code of ethics printed as in his or her discretion will be sufficient for distribution to the officials, employees and board, panel, task forces, authorities, and commission members, as well as having copies available at the city hall for citizens of the city.

If, by majority vote, the board rules that the respondent did not violate the ethics code as charged by the complainant, then the matter is concluded. If the board, by majority vote, concludes that the respondent did violate the ethics code as charged by complainant, then the board must make a second decision by majority vote as to the appropriate penalty. 
(14)  At any hearing held by the board of ethics, the public official who is the subject of inquiry shall have the right to written notice of the complaint at least ten business days before a hearing, to be represented by counsel, to hear and examine the evidence and witnesses, and to present evidence and witnesses in opposition or in extenuation and to be provided copies of any document in possession of the city or complainant to be used against them at least five business days in advance of the hearing. Failure to provide such documents shall preclude their submission and consideration by the board. 
(15)  The complainant's evidence must prove that respondent is guilty of the offense charged by the evidentiary standard commonly referred as "preponderance of the evidence." 
(16)  If any question concerning the hearing procedures which is not otherwise addressed in this article arise, the city attorney, or in his absence, the appointed legal advisor to the board shall resolve the procedural question by advisory opinion then said opinion shall be adopted or declined by the board.

Sec. 2-6-11. - Penalties. 
Any public official who knowingly violates any provision of the code of ethics provided in this article shall be subject to public reprimand or censure. If, in the opinion of the board of ethics, the matter warrants such action, the matter may be sent to the solicitor pro hac vice for review for trial in city court, or to another law enforcement agency for investigation. A decision of the board recommending public reprimand, censure or referral to a law enforcement agency may be appealed to the superior court. Superior court review shall be limited to an inquiry of whether or not there was any evidence before the administrative board, which supported their decision. If a conviction results in city court, said offense shall be punishable as a misdemeanor, and may result in a $1,000.00 fine and/or 60 days in jail.

Sec. 8-3-21. - Precautions to be taken by owners. 
(a)  No person owning or having custody or control of any dog or other animal known by such person to be vicious, dangerous, or potentially dangerous shall permit it to run at large, or permit it to run loose on or within the premises of such person in such a manner as to endanger the life or limb of any person lawfully entering such premises. 
(b)  It shall be the duty of every owner of any vicious animal or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog, or anyone having any such animal in his/her possession or custody, to ensure that the vicious animal or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog is kept under restraint, as prescribed in subsections (d), (e), and (f) of this section, and that reasonable care and precautions are taken to prevent the vicious animal or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog from leaving, while unattended, the real property limits of its owner, custodian, or harborer, and it is securely and humanely enclosed within a house, building, fence, locked pen, or other enclosure out of which it cannot climb, dig, jump, or otherwise escape on its own volition. Such enclosure must be securely locked at any time the animal is left unattended so that children are prevented from entry and to prevent the vicious animal or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog from escaping. 
(c)  For owners of a vicious animal or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog whose animal lives out-of-doors, a portion of their property should be fenced with a perimeter or area fence. Within this perimeter fence, the vicious animal or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog must be humanely confined inside a locked pen or kennel of adequate size.

At the hearing, the owner of the dog shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence, and, in addition thereto, the hearing board shall receive such other evidence and hear such other testimony as the hearing board may find reasonably necessary to make a determination either to sustain, modify, or overrule the animal control officer's classification of the dog. 
(c)  Within ten days after the date of the hearing, the animal control hearing board shall notify the dog owner in writing by certified mail of its determination on the matter. If such determination is that the dog is a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog, the notice shall specify the date upon which that determination is effective. 
(d)  A certificate of registration to the effect that the dog owner has a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog shall also be issued by the animal control officer, and is contingent upon the dog owner presenting to the animal control officer evidence of:

This registration fee is subject to change as dictated by the county board of commissioners. Certificates of registration shall be renewed on an annual basis. At the time of the annual renewal of a certificate of registration, an animal control officer shall require evidence from the owner or make such investigation as may be necessary to verify that the dangerous or potentially dangerous dog is continuing to be confined in a proper enclosure and that the owner is continuing to comply with other provisions of this article. 
(f)  Issuance of a certificate of registration or the renewal of a certificate of registration by the animal control officer does not warrant or guarantee that the requirements specified in section 8-3-21 of this article are maintained by the owner of a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog on a continuous basis following the date of the issuance of the initial certificate of registration, or following the date of any renewal of such certificate. 
(g)  The owner of a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog shall notify the animal control officer within 24 hours if the dog is on the loose, is unconfined, has attacked a human, has died, or been sold, stolen or donated. If the dog is sold or donated, the owner shall also provide the name, address and telephone number of the new owner. If sold or donated to another resident of the county, the new owner has ten days after taking possession of the dog to register the dog with the county animal control. If the owner moves with the dog from one jurisdiction to another within the state, the owner shall register the dangerous or potentially dangerous dog in the new jurisdiction within ten days after becoming a resident. 
(h)  The owner of a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog who is a new resident of the state shall register the dog as required in this article within 30 days after becoming a resident.

Chapter 11 - BUSINESS LICENSING AND REGULATION 
ARTICLE 2. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 

Sec. 11-2-1. - Findings; public purpose. 
(a)  The mayor and council, which is the governing body of the City of Hapeville, Georgia (the "city"), is aware of the following evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the mayor and council of the city: 
(1)  Findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986) and Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976), and in articles and studies in other communities including, but not limited to: Rome, Georgia; Adams County, Colorado; New York, New York; Newport News, Virginia; El Paso, Texas; Manatee County, Florida; Bellevue, Washington; Kent, Washington; City of Sandy Springs, Georgia; Fulton County, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and other studies, articles, and court decisions; and 
(2)  The opinion of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Flanigan's Enterprises, Inc. of Georgia v. Fulton County, Ga., 596 F.3d 1265 (11th Cir. 2010), which discusses extensive evidence of negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments in Fulton County, Georgia incorporated into the record of the proceedings before the mayor and council of the city; and 
(3)  Three articles authored or co-authored by Dr. Richard McCleary, Professor at the University of California, Irvine, entitled "Rural Hotspots: The Case of Adult Business" (2008); "Do Peep Shows 'Cause' Crime? A Response to Linz, Paul, and Yao" (2006); and "Do 'Off-Site' Adult Businesses Have Secondary Effects? Legal Doctrine, Social Theory, and Empirical Evidence" (2009), incorporated into the record of the proceedings before the mayor and council of the city; and 
(b)  Based upon all of this evidence, the mayor and council of the city find: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses, also known as adult entertainment establishments, lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or inadequately controlled by the operators of the establishments. Sexually oriented businesses cause an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including, but not limited to, disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use, assaults and batteries, and corruption of public officials. 
(2)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, may occur at sexually oriented businesses. Offering or providing private or semi-private space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
(3)  Adult entertainment establishments escalate and exacerbate undesirable community conditions, including, but not limited to, blight, diminished property values, increased need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, and increased burden on the judicial system as a result of the criminal behavior which the mayor and council find such business establishments bring to a community. The secondary negative effects that are caused by such businesses are not limited to such facilities that offer live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts, but other forms of sexually oriented businesses that also have a deleterious effect on nearby neighborhoods, commercial districts, and on urban life in general. These other types of such businesses include , but are not limited to adult bookstores, peep shows, massage parlors, bath houses, adult gift and novelty shops, and lingerie or nude modeling studios. 
(4)  Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. 
(5)  Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses. 
(6)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(7)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in some areas of some sexually oriented businesses. 
(8)  The findings noted in subsections (1) through (7) raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(9)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(10)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other secondary negative effects as described herein. 
(11)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(12)  The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter. 
(13)  The barring of such individuals from the management of adult entertainment establishments for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(14)  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter. 
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities as described above, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the city; and based on the findings of multiple courts around the country; and based on the documentary evidence submitted to the mayor and council, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country. 
It is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total), under certain circumstances, in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with commercial nudity and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are criminal activity, depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove referenced. The mayor and council find it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city, as well, unless these regulations are adopted. 
Furthermore, it is the finding of the mayor and council that nude or semi-nude live entertainment and other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in the city and surrounding communities. 
The mayor and council further find that each separate adverse secondary effect of adult entertainment businesses and sexually oriented businesses constitutes a substantial governmental interest, that each substantial governmental interest includes, but is not limited to, preventing future adverse secondary effects of both pre-existing sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment businesses in the city and those that may open in the future, and the viability of each separate substantial governmental interest of the city addressed herein does not depend upon any comparative analysis between adult entertainment businesses and non-adult entertainment businesses. 
The mayor and council therefore find that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the city, the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the mayor and council of the city find that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment, and find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions. The mayor and council further find that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To all of these ends, this chapter is hereby adopted. 
Also based upon all of the information, studies, and findings in court decisions, as well as the well known and self evident conditions and secondary effects caused by the commercial exploitation of commercial nudity combined with the sale, dispensing and consumption of alcoholic beverages, the mayor and council also find and conclude that the sale, dispensing, or consumption of alcoholic beverages of any kind in an adult entertainment establishment as defined herein tends to independently create, aggravate, exacerbate, and add to all of those negative secondary effects set forth in this section. The purpose and intent of this article is to address and forestall those negative secondary effects in the city within the permissible limits and parameters of the Georgia and United States Constitutions.

Sec. 35-1-15. - Liability of city. 
Neither the city nor any officer or employee thereof shall be held responsible for any damages caused by any excavations in any street, alley, sidewalk, public right-of-way, or other public place made by any person under the authority of a permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The permittee shall be solely liable for any damage or loss occasioned by any act or omission occurring in connection with the excavation, and shall fully indemnify, hold harmless and defend the city, its officers and employees from and against any and all suits, actions, judgments, losses, costs, demands, claims, expenses (including attorney's fees), damages, and liabilities of every kind to which the city, its officers or employees may be subjected for injury of any type, death or property damage arising from or connected with any such act or omission.

(Code 1981, § 5-1-15; Ord. No. 98-15, § 1, 9-1-1998) 
Sec. 35-1-16. - Coordination of excavations. 
(a)  Any utility owning, operating or installing in city streets and rights-of-way, alleys, sidewalks, public rights-of-way or any other public places facilities providing water, sewer, gas, electric, communication, video or other utility services shall prepare and submit to the director a utility master plan, in a format specified by the director, that shows the location of the utility's existing facilities in city streets and rights-of-way, alleys, sidewalks and other public places, and shows all of the utility's planned major utility work in city streets and rights-of-way, alleys, sidewalks and other public places. Utilities shall submit an initial utility master plan no later than 180 days after the effective date of the ordinance adopting this section. Thereafter, each utility shall submit semiannually, on the first regular business day of January and July, a revised and updated utility master plan. As used in this subsection, the term "planned major utility work" refers to any and all future excavations planned by the utility when the utility master plan or update is submitted that will affect any city street, alley, sidewalk or other public place for more than five days, provided that the utility shall not be required to show future excavations planned to occur more than five years after the date that the utility master plan or update is submitted. 
(b)  The director shall make all utility master plans submitted in accordance with subsection (a), above, available for public inspection. 
(c)  Excavations in city streets and rights-of-way disrupt and interfere with the public use of city streets and rights-of-way and damage the pavement. The purpose of this section is to reduce this disruption, interference and damage by promoting better coordination among utilities making excavations in city streets and rights-of-way and between these utilities and the city. Better coordination will assist in minimizing the number of excavations being made wherever feasible, and will ensure that excavations in city streets and rights-of-way are, to the maximum extent possible, performed before, rather than after, the resurfacing of the streets by the city. 
(d)  Coordination also provides a means for utilities to avoid payment of a trench cut cost recovery fee either by eliminating the need for a new excavation, or, if an excavation is made, by allowing the excavation to qualify for an exemption from the trench cut cost recovery fee pursuant to section 35-1-3(d). However, even utilities performing the best possible coordination will find it necessary to make excavations that do not qualify for an exemption from the trench cut cost recovery fee. For this reason, and in order to provide a further incentive for such utilities to perform the best possible coordination, if a utility coordinates its work with other utilities and/or the city so that no trench cut cost recovery fee is required for at least 80 percent of the linear feet of its total excavations in city streets and rights-of-way during a calendar year, the utility shall receive a refund, without interest, of 25 percent of the trench cut cost recovery fees the utility paid during that year. If a utility coordinates its work with other utilities and/or the city so that no trench cut cost recovery fee is required for at least 90 percent of the linear feet of its total excavations in city streets and rights-of-way during a calendar year, the utility shall receive a refund, without interest, of one-half percent of the trench cut cost recovery fees the utility paid during that year. If a utility coordinates its work with other utilities and/or the city so that no trench cut cost recovery fee is required for at least 95 percent of the linear feet of its total excavations in city streets and rights-of-way during a calendar year, the utility shall receive a refund, without interest, of 100 percent of the trench cut cost recovery fees the utility paid during that year. Upon appropriation by the city council, city funds authorized for the purpose of maintenance, repair or resurfacing of city streets shall be transferred to the special fund or funds created pursuant to section 35-1-3(e) to replace any amount refunded pursuant to this subsection. The director shall adopt procedures for implementing this subsection. 
(Code 1981, § 5-1-16; Ord. No. 98-15, § 1, 9-1-1998) 
Sec. 35-1-17. - Additional requirements. 
(a)  In addition to the requirements of this chapter, cable television franchisees and licensees shall construct facilities in accordance with the provisions of chapter 38 of this Code. In the event of any conflict between the requirements of this chapter and the provisions of chapter 38, the provisions of chapter 38 shall govern. 
(b)  All utility installations permitted under this chapter shall, upon demand of the director, be relocated or lowered if required by the city to avoid potential conflicts with a proper governmental use of a street, alley, sidewalk or other public place. All expenses incurred in relocating, lowering lines, potholing or marking of facilities to determine their exact location after the original installation shall be paid for by the permittee. As used in this section, "relocating" shall mean lowering and any other adjustments. 
(c)  Upon completion of underground or surface work permitted under this chapter, the permittee shall furnish as built plans of the installation showing a correct plan view to scale, details and a profile showing the locations of all the elements of the installation based on data obtained in the field during construction. 
(d)  Private parties and nonpublic utilities shall comply with the following additional requirements: 
(1)  The permittee shall take out, pay for and maintain, during the period in which the permit is in effect, a policy of public liability and property damage insurance protecting permittee, permittee's agents and employees against any liability, injury or death sustained or suffered by the public or damage to the property of the public by reason of the work carried on under the permit. The public liability insurance shall be for the limits of at least $300,000.00 for injury to one person and $500,000.00 for injury to more than one person, and the property damage insurance limit shall be at least $100,000.00. The insurance shall be placed with a company satisfactory to the chief administrator of the city, prior to the date that work under the permit is commenced. The policy or policies of insurance shall name the city, its officers and employees as additional named insureds and shall contain an endorsement precluding cancellation or reduction in coverage without giving the chief administrator at least ten days' written notice prior thereto. 
(2)  If required on the face thereof, the permit shall not be effective for any purpose unless and until the permittee files with the chief administrator a corporate surety bond or other security approved by the chief administrator in the amount specified on the face of the permit, said bond or other security to fully assure the performance by permittee of all obligations imposed upon permittee under the provisions of the permit and this chapter.

The notice of appeal shall include or attach a statement describing the action being appealed, setting forth the grounds for the appeal, and describing the action requested of the board of appeals. The scope of the appeal shall be limited to the grounds specified in the notice of appeal. No later than 30 days after the filing of a timely notice of appeal, the board of appeals shall render a decision on the appeal. The board of appeals' decision may affirm, reverse or modify the decision appealed. A copy of the board of appeals' decision shall be provided to the person appealing at the address shown on the notice of appeal. 
(b)  Any person required to pay a trench cut cost recovery fee pursuant to section 35-1-2(c) who desires to protest or otherwise challenge imposition of the fee shall tender to the city payment in full of the fee when due, accompanied by a written notice containing the following information: 
(1)  A statement that the required payment is tendered under protest; and 
(2)  A description of the factual and legal basis for the protest. 
(c)  Any judicial action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, void or annul the imposition of a trench cut cost recovery fee for which a written notice of protest is filed pursuant to subsection (b), above, shall be filed no later than 90 days after the notice is received by the city.

ARTICLE 2. - TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS AND ANTENNAS 

Sec. 38-2-1. - Purpose, findings and goals. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of telecommunication towers and antennas, and the facilities whereon such towers or antennas are located. 
(b)  The mayor and council recognize that the city is to provide for the siting of telecommunication towers and antennas pursuant to the mandates of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. While mandated to make such provisions, the mayor and council also recognize that telecommunication towers and antennas can negatively impact the aesthetic appearance of the city, and can reduce the property value of lots proximately located to such towers, particularly when they are sited adjacent to residential areas. 
(c)  The goals of this article, therefore, are to: 
(1)  Express the intent of the mayor and council that the construction of new towers be an option of last resort and, to the extent feasible, location of antennas on existing towers, building rooftops, and other suitable structures should first be sought; 
(2)  Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; 
(3)  Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites; 
(4)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 
(5)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to construct them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers or antennas; 
(6)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures; 
(7)  Develop an inventory of existing sites with specific information about the load capacity of each existing site, remaining developable land area available at the site, and any terms or conditions of the lease which would affect the possibility of collocation at the site; and 
(8)  Provide for the disposition of towers which are abandoned by all users, and set forth the time period within which the requirements would apply and responsibility for the removal of abandoned towers. 
(9)  Encourage the use of construction methods and telecommunications conveyances which are the least visually obtrusive.

Each grantee shall enter into an agreement with the city which is consistent with the terms of this article. Each franchise agreement granted under this article shall be personal to the grantee and the terms of each franchise agreement may vary.

(b)  It is not the intention of this article nor any subsequent agreement to grant any property right whatsoever to grantee. Further, grantee is required to contractually relinquish any claimed easement right within the city's municipal right-of-way. If any facility is placed by grantee outside of the city's right-of-way and such right-of-way is later expanded to include the grantee's facility, upon the city's request, such facility shall be removed or relocated at grantee's full and sole expense. The grantee, under contract and for the express consideration of the use of the city's right-of-way shall waive any and all claim for reimbursement for any costs for any removed or relocated facility and for any claim of any easement or other property right in the public right-of-way or expanded public right-of-way.

(b)  In those areas of the city where transmission or distribution facilities of all the public utilities providing telephone and electric power service are underground, the grantee likewise shall construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities therein underground. 
(c)  In those areas of the city where a grantee's cables or facilities are located on the above-ground transmission or distribution facilities of the public utility providing telephone, electric power, or other service, and in the event that the facilities of such public utilities subsequently are placed underground, then the grantee likewise shall construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at grantee's cost, provided that grantee may request a waiver, in writing, of the requirement for underground placement where such underground placement would be technologically unfeasible. Certain of grantee's equipment, such as pedestals, amplifiers and power supplies, which normally are placed aboveground, may continue to remain in above-ground closures. 
(d)  If the grades, lines, or right-of-way of any street within the service area are changed at any time during the term of a franchise, then the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades, lines, or rights-of-way. In the event that the grantee refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the city and the grantee shall pay to the city all costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alternation, or relocation. 
(e)  Prior to construction a final location plan shall be submitted for approval by the inspection department, and the inspection department shall be authorized to permit or to require an alternate location for the proposed facilities within the public right-of-way to avoid conflict with other permitted uses or to establish an appropriate width from curb for placement of conduit for the use proposed. The city also reserves the right to inspect the installation and maintenance of grantee's facilities in or on the city's property. 
(f)  The grantee shall provide as-built drawings, acceptable to the city detailing the number and location of facilities installed pursuant to this article. The number and location of facilities may be reasonably regulated as set forth in this chapter. 
(g)  The grantee shall give the city 30 days advance written notice requesting any additional use of right-of-way and shall abide by any permitting requirements as specified by city ordinances. 
(h)  In connection with the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade, or removal of the facilities the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, protect any and all existing structures belonging to the city and all designated landmarks. The grantee agrees that it shall be liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace or repair and restore to its previous serviceable condition, in a manner as may be specified by the city, any street or any municipal structure involved in the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the facilities that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by or on behalf of the grantee. 
(i)  In connection with the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade, or removal of the facility, the grantee shall not obstruct the streets, railways, passenger travel, river navigation, or other traffic to, from, or within the public rights-of-way without prior consent of the city and any other appropriate authorities. All such work shall be performed so as to cause minimal interference with users of the streets and adjoining property owners. 
(j)  The grantee shall, upon prior written notice by the city or any person holding a permit to move any structure, temporarily move its wires to permit the moving of said structure. The grantee may impose a reasonable charge on any person other than the city for any such movement of its wires. However, imposition of such a charge shall not be deemed to constitute an easement benefiting grantee. 
(k)  In case of a grantee's disturbance of pavement, sidewalks, driveways or other surfaces, the grantee shall, at its sole expense, replace and restore such surfaces, in as good a condition as before such work was commenced and in accordance with city standards. 
(l)  Erection, removal, and common uses of poles. 
(1)  No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by the grantee without first having entered into a pole attachment agreement with the city. However, no location of any pole or wire-holding structure of the grantee shall be vested interest and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the council determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. 
(2)  Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing for use in serving the city are available for use by the grantee on reasonable terms the council may require the grantee to use such poles and structures. If a grantee believes the terms with a private supplier to be unreasonable, it may apply, in writing, to the city for a waiver of this requirement. 
(3)  Poles in public right-of-way shall be removed or relocated at the sole expense of grantee at the request of the city when, in the city's sole discretion, removal or relocation is deemed necessary.

Upon such request for payment, the city shall notify the grantee of the amount and date thereof.

ARTICLE 1. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 51-1-1. - Title. 
This chapter shall be known as the city's "flood damage prevention ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-21-2015) 
Sec. 51-1-2. - Statutory authorization. 
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does ordain this chapter and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
(Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-21-2015) 
Sec. 51-1-3. - Findings of fact. 
It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(2)  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
(3)  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: 
a.  Protect human life and health; 
b.  Minimize damage to private property; 
c.  Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and 
d.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
(Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-21-2015) 
Sec. 51-1-4. - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and 
(6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
(Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-21-2015) 
Sec. 51-1-5. - Applicability. 
This chapter shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city. For lands subsequently annexed into the city, the special flood hazard areas identified on Fulton County maps and studies shall be subject to regulation under this chapter. For those land areas acquired by the city through annexation, the current effective flood insurance study, supporting maps, and other data for the county are hereby adopted by reference. 
(Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-21-2015)

Sec. 51-1-8. - Compatibility with other regulations. 
This chapter is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, easement, covenant, deed restriction or other provision of law. The requirements of this chapter are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
(Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-21-2015) 
Sec. 51-1-9. - Severability. 
If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this chapter shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2015-06 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-21-2015) 
Sec. 51-1-10. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the development project is located. 
Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of the structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building (including a gas or liquid storage tank), that is principally above ground, or a manufactured home. 
Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway.

The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the code enforcement official. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the requirements of this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the city shall have the right to appeal such decision to the mayor and council as established by the city in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the mayor and council. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the mayor and council may appeal such decision to the superior court of Fulton County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(7)  In reviewing such requests, the city and the mayor and council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(8)  Conditions for variances. 
a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and

(Ord. No. 2016-34 , § 1, 1-10-2017) 
Sec. 57-1-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the city or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The city may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 15, 16 and 17 of section 57-1-4(c) in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  Additional protections. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
(15)  Except as provided in subsections (16) and (17) of this subsection (c), there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream that, under normal circumstances, has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(17)  There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280, et seq., the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970.", and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented; 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in EPD Rule 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
(d)  Minimum requirements. Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent the city from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
(e)  Permits. The fact that land-disturbing activity for a project for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2016-34 , § 1, 1-10-2017) 
Sec. 57-1-5. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. 
(1)  The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The city shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(2)  Wetlands as defined in 33 CFR Part 328.3(b) are an important resource, which are protected through the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended. This act regulates all dredge and fill activities in "water of the U.S." and is administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Land disturbing activities may require a Section 404 permit administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The United States Department of Interior has prepared a national wetlands inventory map covering the city. The map is known as the Hapeville National Wetlands Inventory Map and is incorporated in this article by reference. To assist applicants for land disturbance permits, the city has available for public inspection a copy of the Hapeville National Wetlands Inventory Map. It is encouraged that permit applicants for land disturbance use this map as a resource to identify wetlands. Permit applicants are cautioned, however, that all wetlands may not be identified by this map and the responsibility for defining wetlands and securing any necessary state or federal permits rests solely with the applicant. Applicants for land disturbance permits are advised that only the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for certifying whether or not wetlands are present on the site, the city is not involved with Section 404 permitting. As a part of the process of obtaining a land disturbance permit, all applicants must complete and submit an "acknowledgement and certification" form provided by the city which acknowledges the applicant has investigated Section 404 permitting criteria and has determined whether or not the permit is required for the project for which a land disturbance permit has been requested. Should the applicant certify a Section 404 permit is not required, the city must make a determination from the map as to whether or not the presence of wetlands is likely within the area in which the permit is requested. Should the city determine that the presence of wetlands is not likely in the area the city may issue the land disturbance permit. However, should the city determine that the presence of wetlands is likely in the area the city may not issue the land disturbance permit. A determination by the city that the presence of wetlands is likely in the area requires that the applicant obtain a determination to be made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If wetlands are present, the applicant must obtain a Section 404 permit prior to being issued a land disturbance permit. Should the applicant certify a Section 404 permit is required, the city may not issue a land disturbance permit until the applicant provides a copy of the Section 404 permit to the city. Any action by the city under this article does not relieve the property owner, developer, or petitioner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD, if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of section 57-1-4 will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  A fee, in the amount of $500.00, shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
(4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-17(9) or 12-7-17(10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the city shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the city. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections (15), (16) and (17) of section 57-1-4(c) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (7) of this subsection (b) have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the city and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the city to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The city, with plan review authority, shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the city, with plan review authority, to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the city may deny the permit application. 
(7)  The city may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this chapter or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the city may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the city with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections (b) and (c) of section 57-1-4, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the city of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the city unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the city has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by subsections (15), (16) and 17 of section 57-1-4(c) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(7) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the city. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the city, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The city may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Ord. No. 2016-34 , § 1, 1-10-2017) 
Sec. 57-1-6. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The community services department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the city shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
(b)  The city shall amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The community services department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to Code section 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
(Ord. No. 2016-34 , § 1, 1-10-2017) 
Sec. 57-1-7. - Penalties and incentives. 
(a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. 
(b)  Stop-work orders. 
(1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this chapter, the director or the city shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the city shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, thact, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the city shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
(2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the city shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
(3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
(4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the city or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the city or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
(c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection (7) of section 57-1-5(b). The city may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
(d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this chapter, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose a penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this chapter under county ordinances approved under this chapter shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

Chapter 58 - SURFACING AND MAINTENANCE OF DRIVEWAYS AND OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES 

Sec. 58-1-1. - Purpose, intent, and nonconforming use, and grace period for compliance with regulations. 
(a)  In adopting this chapter, it is the intent of mayor and council to clarify amendments made on July 16, 2013 to former section 93-23-5 of the Code wherein the surfacing and maintenance of residential driveways and commercial off-street parking and loading facilities were regulated. 
(b)  Residential driveways that were constructed of a material other than hard-surfaced pavement prior to July 16, 2013 shall have until June 31, 2021 to come into full compliance with the regulations set forth within section 58-1-3 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2016-29 , § 1, 1-10-2017; Ord. No. 2017-09 , § 1, 5-2-2017) 
Sec. 58-1-2. - Definitions. 
(a)  Asphalt, porous. Asphalt concrete from which small aggregates are omitted from the asphalt mixture. The remaining large, single-sized aggregate particles leave open voids that give the material its porosity and permeability. To ensure pavement strength, fiber may be added to the mix or a polymer-modified asphalt binder may be used. Generally, porous asphalt pavements are designed with a subsurface reservoir that holds water that passes through the pavement, allowing it to evaporate and/or percolate slowly into the surrounding soils. An example of a porous asphalt surface is an open-graded fixture course. 
(b)  Concrete, porous. A type of concrete with a high porosity used for concrete flatwork applications that allows water from precipitation and other sources to pass directly through, thereby reducing the runoff from a site and allowing groundwater recharge. 
(c)  Gravel. Rock, including but not limited to granite, limestone, dolomite, crushed and graded by screens and then mixed to a blend of stones and fines. Gravel is also known as "crusher run," DGA (dense grade aggregate), QP (quarry process), and shoulder stone. Gravel is generally between five to 15 millimeters in size. 
(d)  Materials, pervious. Materials, such as concrete paving blocks, concrete grid pavers, perforated brick pavers, or other similar materials approved by the city engineer or his or her designee, that permit water to enter the ground by virtue of their porous nature or by large spaces in the material. 
(e)  Hard-surfaced Pavement. Pavement made hard or firm by compacting or paving it with an asphalt (or bituminous) surface, hot mix asphalt (HMA) surface, Portland cement concrete (PCC) surface, pervious pavement, or similar materials approved by the city engineer or his or her designee. 
(f)  Pavement, permeable. Pavement utilizing a range of sustainable materials and techniques with a base and subbase that allow the movement of storm water through the surface. Pervious materials allow storm water to percolate and infiltrate the surface areas, traditionally impervious to the soil below. Examples of permeable pavement include open cell pavers, porous asphalt, porous concrete, and other material approved by the city engineer or his or her designee.

Sec. 58-1-3. - Surfacing requirements for single-family residential driveways and hardship exemptions. 
(a)  The construction materials of single-family residential driveways shall consist of porous concrete, asphalt, plain concrete, brick and concrete pavers, or other permeable pavements. Loose gravel shall, in no event, be allowed as a finished surface for such driveways. 
(b)  Residential driveways that were constructed of a material other than hard-surfaced pavement prior to July 16, 2013 shall have until June 31, 2021 to come into full compliance with the regulations set forth within section 58-1-3(a) of this chapter. 
(c)  Hardship exemption: Owner(s) of a single-family residential driveway who allege that they will suffer an extreme and substantial financial hardship in complying with the regulations set forth under sections 58-1-3(a) and 58-1-3(b) of this chapter, may apply to the city council for a hardship exemption from the requirements of this chapter. Such application shall be filed the city clerk. Eligibility for a hardship exemption shall be determined based upon evidence provided by the applicant showing that the property owners will suffer an extreme and adverse financial hardship if forced to comply with the requirements of this chapter. Such evidence may include proof of the financial circumstances of all owners of the property, as well as the status of the property, including the property's involvement in recent and/or pending transfers of ownership and foreclosure.

Sec. 58-1-4. - Surfacing and maintenance requirements for commercial driveways and off-street parking and loading facilities. 
(a)  All commercial driveways and off-street parking and loading facilities regulated under article 23 of chapter 93 of this Code shall be hard-surfaced pavement. Loose gravel shall, in no event, be allowed as a finished surface for such driveways and off-street parking and loading facilities. Such driveways and off-street parking and loading facilities shall also be drained, lighted and maintained by the property owner in accordance with specifications of the city. 
(b)  Parking areas that are in excess of the parking requirements of chapter 93 of this Code may consist of pervious materials, provided the total number of parking spaces, including excess spaces, does not exceed 110 percent of the requirement.

(1)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the city finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the appeals board of the city may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
(2)  Except as provided above, the planning commission of the city shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the planning commission. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the article would create an extreme hardship. 
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
(3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
(4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;

ARTICLE 4. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 63-4-1. - Short title. 
This article will be known as the city stormwater utility ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2016-20 , § 1, 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 63-4-2. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the establishment of a stormwater utility in the city. The objectives of this article are stated as follows: 
(1)  The professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the mayor and council properly assess and define the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the city. 
(2)  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city, it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of a separate accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city. 
(3)  Stormwater management is necessary throughout the city. Intense urban development in the city has radically altered the natural hydrology of the area and the hydrologics of stormwater systems, with many natural elements having been replaced or augmented by man-made facilities. As a result, the specific service, system demands in the city now exceed the service capability of many of the systems. An advanced level of service is needed in the city due to its urbanization, therefore a stormwater utility service area subject to stormwater service fees should encompass the entirety of the city to enable the city to successfully manage, operate and improve stormwater systems at an advanced level. 
(4)  It is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater service level continue to be funded from the city's water and sewer revenue and water and sewer fund revenues, and therefore that the mayor and council may allocate such revenue(s) and funds to support stormwater management in the future in the form of a combination of service fee payments for city-owned properties and a supplemental allocation of general fund funding. 
(5)  The stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Funding of stormwater services and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the city in protecting the public health, safety and welfare. 
(6)  Provision of stormwater management programs and systems renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses, and the service and benefits differ among the individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems. 
(7)  The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs and systems may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management programs and systems and risk exposure. It is not practical to allocate the cost of the city's stormwater management programs, systems in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time, but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the long-term demands they impose on the city's stormwater management programs, systems which render or result in services and benefits. 
(8)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the city, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater systems in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
(9)  The mayor and council find, conclude and determine that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and benefits throughout the city, and the most equitable means to fund an advanced level of stormwater services in the city is through stormwater service fees and other mechanisms as described in the professional engineering and financial analyses prepared for the city. 
(b)  Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the corporate area of Hapeville. 
(c)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
(d)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
(e)  Responsibility for administration. The city manager shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2016-20 , § 1, 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 63-4-3. - Definitions. 
Credit means a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service fee or other fees, rates, rentals, charges, fines and penalties to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility, or continuing provision of a service or activity that reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities. 
Customer means all persons, properties and entities served by and/or benefitting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, regulation and improvement of the stormwater management programs, systems and regulation of public and private stormwater systems and activities related thereto, and persons, properties and entities which will ultimately be served or benefitted as a result of the stormwater management program. 
Developed land shall mean property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 200 square feet of Impervious Surfaces as defined in this chapter. 
Duplexes and triplexes shall mean developed land containing two (duplex) or three (triplex) residential dwelling units located within the same building on one or more parcels of land. 
Equivalent residential unit, for the purposes of this article, shall mean 2,400 square feet of impervious surfaces. The equivalent residential unit shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater service fees to single-family dwelling unit properties or classes of single-family dwelling unit properties and to other developed lands. 
Hydrologic response means the manner whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including but not limited to the presence of impervious area, the size, shape, topographic, vegetative and geologic conditions of a property, antecedent moisture conditions and groundwater conditions on a property. 
Impervious surfaces means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, paved areas and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development or other imposition of impervious surfaces. 
Multiple-family dwelling unit residential properties shall mean developed land whereon more than one residential dwelling unit is located, and shall include, but not be limited to, apartment houses, structures containing multiple residential condominiums located on a single parcel of property, boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, personal care homes, homes for the elderly, retirement and nursing homes, and other structures in which more than one family group commonly and normally reside or could reside. For the application of stormwater service fees, multiple-family dwelling unit residential properties shall be treated in the same manner as are other developed lands as defined in this article. 
Other developed lands shall mean, but not be limited to, multiple-family dwelling unit residential unit properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial, retail and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, railroad stations and other transportation facilities covered by impervious surfaces, parking lots and decks, parks and other recreational properties, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, and water and wastewater treatment plants and all other types of developed land except single-family dwelling units. 
Single-family dwelling unit shall mean developed land upon which is located one principal structure that contains one dwelling unit designed for occupancy by one family, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities. Single-family dwelling units may include houses, duplexes, triplexes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land, and fee-simple ownership or condominium townhomes and attached single-family residential structures located on individual lots or parcels of land and such single units located on more than one individual lot or parcel of land. For the purposes of this article, developed land may be classified as a single-family dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental and/or accessory structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports or small storage buildings, accessory dwellings or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional areas of impervious surfaces such as parking spaces, playgrounds or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship or similar nonresidential uses. Single-family dwelling units shall not include developed land containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple-family residential units that are individually owned but are located on a single parcel of developed land, such as condominiums and cooperatively-owned apartments. 
Stormwater management systems or stormwater systems or systems means those natural and man-made channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, area drains, drop inlets, junction boxes, pipes, head walls, flared end sections, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
Stormwater service fees or stormwater service charge shall mean the periodic service fee imposed pursuant to this article by the city for the purpose of recovering and/or funding costs related to stormwater management systems and facilities. The use of the area of impervious surface on each property as a measure to determine the stormwater service fee rate shall not preclude the use of other measures, or of grouping of properties having similar characteristics into classes or categories, grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate fees for one or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the city's cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service fees may also include certain special charges to individual properties or persons for stormwater management systems and facilities or services related to stormwater management, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced levels of stormwater service above and beyond the service levels normally provided by city. 
Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state.

(b)  A stormwater enterprise fund shall be established in the city budget and accounting system for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees and licenses as may be established by the mayor and council and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the stormwater utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater enterprise fund and all expenses of the utility shall be paid from the stormwater enterprise fund, except that other revenues receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management programs, systems, operations and capital investments as deemed appropriate by the mayor and council, upon recommendation by the city manager. 
(c)  The mayor and council hereby confer upon the stormwater utility operational control over the existing stormwater management programs, systems performed, provided or owned and heretofore operated by the city and other related assets, including but not limited to properties other than roadways upon which such systems are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management. 
(Ord. No. 2016-20 , § 1, 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 63-4-5. - Scope of responsibility for the stormwater management systems.

(3)  Are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of systems. 
(b)  Operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater management systems which are located on private property or public property not owned by the city and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of such systems shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by state and federal law. 
(c)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of all properties and persons in general by regulation of the stormwater management systems, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. 
(d)  To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation, or rule of the city or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees or agents. 
(Ord. No. 2016-20 , § 1, 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 63-4-6. - Requirements for on-site stormwater management systems: enforcement methods and inspections. 
(a)  Every owner of real property located in the city, and every person which serves as a contractor for the purpose of developing real property located in the city shall, as to the real property owned or being developed, provide, manage, maintain and operate on-site stormwater management systems and facilities sufficient to collect, convey, detain, control and discharge stormwater in a manner which is in compliance with all of the city ordinances and resolutions, and state and federal laws, rules and regulations, and which, in any event, will not discharge stormwater in a manner which will flood, damage or otherwise harm property which is located downstream from the real property owned or being developed. A failure by an owner and/or contractor to meet the obligations and requirements imposed by this article shall constitute a private nuisance and the parties damaged thereby or the city may bring an action to abate such nuisance. Any parties so damaged may include in such action a claim for the damages that such party has sustained. 
(b)  If any court of competent jurisdiction shall find that the failure of the owner and/or contractor to meet the obligations and requirements imposed by this article constitutes a public nuisance, and the owner and/or developer fails to abate such nuisance within any time limit which the court might impose, the city may enter upon the property at issue and cause such work to be performed as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance, with the cost of such work to be charged to the owner and the developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. 
(c)  If the city incurs costs to abate a public nuisance, the city shall file suit to recover such costs and establish its judgment lien rights in relation thereto, which lien rights shall be perfected, after judgment, by the city filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the superior court of Fulton County. 
(d)  The city's designated officers, representatives, agents and employees shall have the right, pursuant to its authority in chapter 54, to enter upon private and public property owned other than by the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner of such property, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests on such property in order to assure compliance with any order or judgment entered pursuant to this section. 
(Ord. No. 2016-20 , § 1, 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 63-4-7. - Stormwater management fees authorized. 
(a)  The city is authorized to impose a service fee on each customer of the stormwater system, provided that such fee is closely associated with the amount of impervious surface associated with a particular property for which the service fee is imposed. 
(b)  Single-family dwelling units, as defined by this article, shall be billed for one equivalent residential unit, as defined in this article. 
(c)  The stormwater service fee rate per equivalent residential unit, as defined in this article, shall be $3.50 per month for the calendar year of the effective date of this article and for subsequent years, unless modified by the city. 
(d)  All developed lands not classified as single-family dwelling units, as defined by this article, shall be billed for one equivalent residential unit, as defined by this article, for each 2,400 square feet of impervious surfaces or partial increment thereof located on the property. 
(e)  Stormwater service fee rates may be determined and modified from time to time by the mayor and council of the city so that the total revenue generated by said fees and any other sources of revenues or other resources allocated to stormwater management by the mayor and council shall be sufficient to meet the cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities, including but not limited to the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, operating expense, capital outlays, non-operating expense, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the mayor and council of the city. 
(f)  Stormwater service fee revenues in any given year may exceed or be less than the cost of service in that year, provided, however, that the stormwater service fee rate shall be based on meeting the long-term projected cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities. 
(g)  All unencumbered stormwater management funds derived from service fees and other sources of revenue not expended at the end of a fiscal year shall remain in the stormwater management utility enterprise fund account and balances shall be forwarded to the next fiscal year. 
(h)  Stormwater service fee rates shall be structured so as to be fair and reasonable, and the resultant service fees shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services and systems. 
(i)  The cost of stormwater management services and systems may include operating expenses, capital investments, and reserve accounts. 
(j)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service fees and/or other methods of funding stormwater management shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater systems or to private stormwater systems which impact the proper function of the public stormwater systems. 
(Ord. No. 2016-20 , § 1, 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 63-4-8. - Billing, delinquencies, and collection of stormwater service fees. 
(a)  The city is authorized to establish and/or utilize its own policies with respect to the billing and collection of the stormwater utility service fees and the treatment of delinquent accounts. The stormwater utility service fee may be billed separately, or on a customer statement and collected along with other utility services provided by the city, at the city's sole discretion. The city is authorized to apply partial payments proportionately among the water, sewer, and stormwater fees charged by the city. The city is authorized to use existing city procedures for disconnection of water service with respect to non-payment. 
(b)  A stormwater service fee bill may be sent though the United States mail or by alternative means, notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. 
(c)  The stormwater service fee bill may be billed and collected along with other fees and charges, including but not limited to, other utility bills, assessments or property taxes, as deemed most effective and efficient by the city manager. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fees and other charges and any associated fines or penalties, including but not limited to, interest on delinquent service fees. If a property owner is under billed, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of developed land, the city stormwater utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest for any delinquency during the back billed period. A late fee of five percent of the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility service fee bill shall be charged when a bill becomes delinquent. Thereafter, an additional fee of one percent based on the unpaid bill and any applicable delinquency fee shall be charged for each month the bill remains delinquent. 
(d)  Stormwater service fees shall begin to accrue August 3, 2016, and shall be billed in arrears. 
(e)  Frequency of the billing of stormwater service fees shall be monthly unless otherwise specified by mayor and council.

(Ord. No. 2016-20 , § 1, 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 63-4-9. - Exemptions and credits. 
(a)  Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater utility service fees or receive a credit or offset against such service fees. No exemption, credit, offset or other reduction in stormwater service fees shall be granted based on the age, tax, or economic status, race or religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities. 
(b)  The following properties are hereby exempt from stormwater service fees: 
(1)  Properties that are not defined in this article as being developed land shall be exempt from stormwater service fees. 
(2)  Railroad tracks, gravel and stone areas underneath and immediately adjacent to the tracks, and undeveloped portions of the railroad right-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater service fees. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, paved or unpaved service roads and drives, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service fees. 
(c)  A stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions shall be prepared by the city engineer and approved by the mayor and council specifying the design and performance standards of on-site stormwater systems, facilities and activities that qualify for application of a service fee credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. 
(d)  The following properties are hereby eligible for credit(s) based on stormwater control systems or other mitigation: 
(1)  Developed land than other single-family dwelling units, which use stormwater control systems or facilities that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces on the subject property. 
a.  Developed land meeting eligibility for credit under this subsection includes but is not limited to: multiple-family dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial, retail and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks and other recreational properties, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, and water and wastewater treatment plants and all other types of developed land except single-family dwelling units may receive a credit against the stormwater service fee applicable to the property. 
b.  The stormwater utility service fee credit for on-site stormwater control systems or facilities under subsection (d)(1) shall be proportional to the extent that the on-site stormwater control systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner meets or exceeds the city's development and performance standards contained in the stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions and other requirements and conditions.

Subpart C - PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT 
Chapter 81 - ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STANDARDS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2008-19, § 1, adopted Feb. 17, 2009, amended Ch. 81 in its entirety and enacted similar provisions as set out herein. The former Ch. 81 derived from Ord. No. 2006-13, § 1, adopted July 11, 2006. 

Sec. 81-1-1. - Introduction and purpose. 
(a)  Introduction. These urban design standards contain regulations that affect the design and character of the public and private realms of the city. Their intent is to carefully balance architecture, landscape design and urban stewardship at all levels to create the highest quality environment for residents and visitors. 

This chapter is intended to focus primarily on urbanism, as opposed to style, for most buildings. Unless specifically required by underlying zoning, it is intended to provide guidance to the city's design review committee (DRC) in the review process on universal principles such as: relationship of buildings to street; facade articulation; building orientation, etc. The standards are intended to balance historic urbanistic precedents in Hapeville with new building typologies not historically found in the area. As such, these standards generally do not indicate specific architectural styles for most parts of the city. 
The document contains both mandatory requirements (indicated with "shall") and optional best practices (indicated with "should" or "where possible.") Where a project does not meet the mandatory requirements, the burden of varying from them is placed on the applicant. In said case, the applicant may solicit support for such variation by providing documentation that the proposed development is consistent with the spirit of this document, precedent, and city policies. Final approval, however, shall be at the discretion of the DRC. 
This chapter comprises several sections. The first sections contain a review of the purpose of this chapter, followed by an overview of definitions, DRC duties, and applicability. These are followed by standards for the commercial/mixed-use area and the neighborhood conservation area. These sections contain text and supporting graphics. Unless specified, graphics and photos are for illustrative purposes only. 
(b)  General purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to encourage and provide a safe environment for pedestrian movement and improve open space areas throughout the community. Development goals include preserving and enhancing the character of existing residential properties and to address new and infill development opportunities. Increased density and intensity of development is allowed in order to maintain and enhance the existing characteristics of the community and to simultaneously improve the visual quality of the built environment throughout the city. 
The standards are separated into commercial/mixed-use area and neighborhood conservation area standards. They respond to issues related to the built environment including, but not limited to, building orientation, heights, articulation, finishes, pedestrian and vehicular access and landscape components. The chapter provides regulations based on maintaining and enhancing the visual characteristics of each district of the community, and providing for new and infill development that maintains its existing fabric. Commercial development is directed away from strip-type, vehicle-oriented centers and towards projects that maintain the feel of an old town requiring walkable, pedestrian-friendly centers to ensure a quality lifestyle and related set of experiences supported by the built environment. 
(c)  Goals. The goals of this chapter are to: 
(1)  Encourage and provide a safe environment for pedestrian movements throughout the city; 
(2)  Address new and infill development that maintains and enhances the existing characteristics of the community; 
(3)  Allow for increased density and intensity of development in underdeveloped portions of the city; 
(4)  Improve open space areas throughout the community; and 
(5)  Improve the visual quality of the built environment.

(d)  Duties and authority. 
(1)  All design, as defined in this chapter, in the city requires design review except as listed herein below. 
(2)  When a design is submitted which does not require site plan review then the same shall be considered by the DRC solely. When a design is submitted which requires site plan review then the DRC shall review the same only after the planning commission has reviewed and supported the site plan. Commercial new construction, single-family residential construction and additions of structures that meet or exceed 50 percent of the existing structure, combining two or more parcels that are adjacent or subdividing two or more parcels, increase of commercial parking by 50 percent or more than 30 inches in elevation adjustments as approved by the city engineer for commercial parking require planning commission approval and DRC review. 
(e)  Standards of review. The DRC shall utilize the purpose and goals outlined in section 81-1-1, the requirements of this chapter as to specific architectural standards. 
(f)  Appeals. Although this chapter is not a zoning regulation, binding decisions of the design review committee are appealable to the board of zoning appeals. 
(g)  Design exceptions. Relief from these standards may be granted by the design review committee upon finding that the design exception: 
(1)  Will not increase traffic, decrease access to the proposed development, or adversely impact the general public safety; and 
(2)  Will not reduce the adequacy of off-street parking, loading, and service for the proposed development unless specifically granted by the planning commission, board of zoning appeals, or authorized shared parking arrangement; and 
(3)  Will not adversely affect the compliance with landscaping, buffering, and irrigation provisions of other Code requirements, and 
(4)  Will result in design that is compatible with adjacent parcels. As used herein "compatible" shall mean "a unified architectural design and signage program within a development having minimal impact on adjacent parcels."

Sec. 81-1-6. - Commercial/mixed-use area. 
Based on goals established in this chapter, the following standards are required in the commercial/mixed-use area identified in section 81-1-3. This includes three subareas: subarea A, subarea B, and subarea C. All of the standards contained in this section shall apply to all private development in subareas A and B. Subarea requirements are found within the applicable subsection. 

Private development in subarea C shall be governed by section 81-1-7 Neighborhood conservation area. Although commercial and mixed uses are permitted in this subarea, the Hapeville Main Street Town Center LCI Plan established a desire to preserve a residential character of this subarea, regardless of use. 
The above notwithstanding, applicants for one-family attached or detached dwellings, two-family dwellings, and multifamily buildings in the commercial/mixed-use area shall elect to comply with the requirements of this section or those of section 81-1-7. The section elected shall be applied to said structures in its entirety. 
To the extent determined by the design review committee, this section's standards should also apply to industrial uses not within the commercial/mixed-use area. For example, certain standards, such as storefront requirements, may not be appropriate for industrial uses, while others, such as material and landscaping requirements, may be. 
(a)  Site development standards. 
1.  Except where indicated, setbacks shall be established by zoning. 
2.  On corner lots the principal building shall be located adjacent to the street intersection, subject to setback or build-to line requirements of zoning. 
3.  On new buildings in subarea A, where the adjoining buildings were built before 1950, the main facade of the new structure shall align with the average existing building facade line of the two adjoining structures closest to the proposed setback. This will maintain the historic uniform setbacks of subarea A and place buildings close to the public right-of-way, thereby, encouraging pedestrian access. 
4.  Except where a greater height is required by zoning, buildings shall provide a minimum height of 24 feet along the build-to line or front setback, including roof parapet walls. One-story buildings meeting this requirement are permitted. 
5.  Except where a greater height is required by zoning, the first story finished floor to ceiling slab height shall be a minimum of 12 feet. 
6.  Maximum building heights shall be established by zoning, except that buildings within 150 feet of a neighborhood conservation area and without an intervening street shall be limited to a maximum height of 35 feet, and shall meet the transitional height plane requirements. 
7.  Space able to be occupied requirements shall be as follows: 
a.  One-family attached and detached dwellings and two-family dwellings shall provide first-story occupiable space for a minimum of the first ten feet of depth along the enfronting facade. 
b.  Reserved. 
c.  All other buildings, including parking decks, shall provide first-story occupiable space for a minimum of the first 20 feet of depth along the enfronting facade. 

8.  Individual front facades of one-family detached dwellings within 15 feet of the front lot line or build-to line shall have no more than two corners, excluding bay windows, porches or stoops. 
9.  Portions of enfronting facades containing first-story retail or restaurant uses shall be composed as a simple plane with jogs of less than ten feet. 
10.  Buildings along Atlanta Avenue, North Central Avenue, South Central Avenue, Virginia Avenue, Dogwood Drive (except in subarea C), or Sylvan Road shall enfront for a minimum of 80 percent of the width of the front setback or build-to line. In no case shall a break in buildings along said streets exceed 30 feet in width. Enfronting facades along said streets shall also meet the requirement of subsection (g)11. for all uses. 
11.  Sidewalks shall be located along all public and private streets. Sidewalks shall be of the widths indicated on the "Commercial/Mixed-use Area Sidewalk Table" and shall consist of two areas: a landscape area and a clear area. 

a.  The landscape area shall be adjacent to the curb and is intended for the placement of trees, street furniture (including utility poles, waste receptacles, fire hydrants, traffic signs and newspaper vending boxes), bus shelters, bicycle racks, public kiosks and similar elements in a manner that does not obstruct pedestrian access or motorist visibility. 
b.  The landscape area may be primarily paved adjacent to on-street parking and shall be landscaped in all other areas. Street trees shall be planted a maximum of 40 feet on center, spaced equal distance between streetlights, and in line with stripes of parallel parking spaces. Al newly planted trees shall be a minimum caliper of two and one-half inches measured 12 inches above ground, shall be limbed up to a minimum height of seven feet and shall have a minimum mature height of 40 feet. Variations to this may be reviewed as approved by the city planning commission. 

COMMERCIAL/MIXED-USE AREA SIDEWALK TABLE 

 
c.  The clear area shall be the portion of the sidewalk reserved for pedestrian passage and unobstructed by permanent objects to a height of eight feet, including, but not limited to, steps and stoops, traffic-control boxes, and utility structures. The sidewalk clear area shall have a consistent cross-slope not exceeding two percent. No awning or canopy shall extend more than five feet over the clear area. 
d.  Where property abuts a neighborhood conservation area without an intervening street, the sidewalk area within 20 feet of such shall taper when necessary to provide a smooth transition to the existing residential sidewalk. In the event that the abutting residential area has no existing sidewalk the sidewalk shall taper to a width of six feet, measured from the street curb, or as approved by the planning commission. 
(c)  Supplemental area and fence standards. 
1.  Supplemental areas in the commercial/mixed-use area shall limited to the treatments identified in Figure 3 and as otherwise identified in this section. 
2.  All first story enfronting commercial uses and all enfronting buildings on Atlanta Avenue, North Central Avenue, South Central Avenue, Virginia Avenue, Dogwood Drive (except in subarea C), or Sylvan Road shall provide the "storefront and awning treatment" identified in Figure 3, and subject to the following additional requirements: 
a.  The supplemental area shall be hardscaped.

5.  "Common yard, porch and fence, terrace or light court," or "forecourt" treatments identified in Figure 3, the supplemental area shall be landscaped and shall include a minimum of one tree every 50 feet of frontage. See list of allowed trees on in section 93-2-14. 
6.  For "porch and fence, terrace or light court, stoop-front," or "forecourt" treatments identified in Figure 3: 
a.  Fences in the supplemental area are permitted and shall be picket-wood, stone, composite materials or ornamental metal, with the finished side facing the street. 
b.  Retaining walls in the supplemental area are permitted and shall not exceed 32 inches in height unless required by topography. 
c.  All street-facing walls shall be faced with stone, full-depth brick, or smooth stucco. 
7.  Chain link fencing is not permitted in areas visible from a public right-of-way. 

Figure 3: Commercial/Mixed-Use Area Supplemental Area Treatments (Courtesy of Smart Code 8.0 and Duany Plater-Zyberk & Co.) 
a)  Common yard: a treatment wherein the facade is set back substantially from sidewalk. The supplemental area shall be unfenced, unwalled, and visually continuous with adjacent supplemental areas, supporting a common landscape. 
b)  Porch and fence: a treatment wherein the facade is set back from the sidewalk with an attached porch permitted to encroach. A fence at the back of the required sidewalk is required as a demarcation of the yard. The porch shall be no less than 8 feet deep. 
c)  Terrace or light court: a treatment wherein the facade is set back from the sidewalk by an elevated terrace or a sunken light court. This type buffers residential use from urban sidewalks and removes the private yard from public encroachment. Fences and walls are permitted in this treatment. 
d)  Forecourt: a treatment wherein a portion of the facade is close to the sidewalk and the central portion is set back. The forecourt is suitable for circular drives or other vehicular drop-offs.

The entrance is usually an exterior stair and landing. This type is recommended for ground-floor residential use. Fences and walls are permitted in this treatment. 
f)  Storefront and awning: a treatment wherein the facade is aligned close to the sidewalk with the building entrance at sidewalk grade. This type is conventional for retail use. It meets the requirements of subsection 81-1-6(g)11. Awnings are encouraged to overlap the sidewalk. Permanent fences and walls are prohibited. 
8.  Where a development adjoins the neighborhood conservation area, the development shall provide a physical barrier between the two to minimize disruptive light, noise, odor, dust, unsightly appearances and intrusive activity relative to the residential area. A smooth transition to the adjacent neighborhood conservation area shall be ensured by providing: 

a.  A minimum 20-foot landscaped buffer located within the development site along the boundary with the neighborhood conservation area. Said buffer shall be planted with a minimum of one tree per 40 linear feet. Shrubs, flowers or grasses shall also be provided and maintained to a minimum height of four feet to visually screen new development and provide an attractive boundary that encourages continued investment in adjacent residential zones. 
b.  A permanent opaque wall between six and eight feet in height and faced in wood, stacked stone, full-depth brick or hard-coat true stucco. Said wall may be located anywhere within the required landscaped buffer. 
c.  Where a public or private alley separates the development from a neighborhood conservation area the landscape buffer and permanent opaque wall shall be provided adjacent to the alley. 
(d)  Utility standards. 
1.  Mechanical features shall be screened from view from any park or along any public right-of-way with planting, walls or fences of equal or greater height.

(e)  Parking and traffic standards. 
1.  Two curb cuts serving two one-way driveways shall be counted as one curb cut. 
2.  Public or private alleys or driveway providing vehicular access to two or more parcels shall not constitute a curb cut. 

3.  New public streets shall not count as curb cuts. 
4.  Parcels are permitted a maximum of one driveway curb cut per street frontage. In cases where a property abuts multiple streets the total number of curb cuts or portions thereof may be allocated to a single street. 
5.  Circular drives are prohibited, with the exception of hotel and hospital uses. 
6.  No curb cuts shall be permitted on North Central Avenue, South Central Avenue, Virginia Avenue or Atlanta Avenue when access can be provided from another street.

c.  The base of carport columns shall be faced in stacked brick or stacked stone to a minimum height of three feet above grade. 
9.  Parking is prohibited in the supplemental area and between a building and the adjacent street. This shall not be interpreted as restricting on-street parking. 

10.  A continuous off right-of-way landscape buffer with a minimum width of ten feet shall be provided between parking and the adjacent sidewalk. This requirement shall apply when existing sidewalks not meeting this requirement are repaired or replaced. 
11.  Parking decks shall conceal automobiles from visibility and have the appearance of a horizontal storied building on all levels; parking structures must be faced in full-depth brick, stone, cast stone, or precast concrete faced in or having the appearance of brick or stone. Retail or restaurant fronted decks are encouraged. 
12.  Underground parking is allowed when possible. 
13.  Drive-through windows and all vehicular queuing, when permitted by zoning, shall be placed to the rear or side of the building facade, shall not be visible from any public right-of-way, and shall not be located within 25 feet of the back of the required sidewalk. 
14.  Gasoline and service stations shall place all fuel dispensing, service canopies and service entry doors to the rear of the building and away from the public right-of-way. Said facilities and associated queuing shall not be visible from any adjacent street or located within 25 feet of the sidewalk.

8.  Chimneys located on an exterior building wall shall begin at grade. 
9.  Flat roofs shall be permitted. 
10.  Buildings with sloped roofs not completely screened from the adjacent street by a parapet shall have a pitch between 4:12 and 12:12. Mansard roofs are prohibited. Pitched-roof materials are limited to roof shingles, natural slate, wood shake, factory-finished sheet metal, and terra cotta tile, unless determined to be historically appropriate by the planning and zoning manager. 
11.  Roof-mounted lights and flagpoles are prohibited. Roof-mounted satellite dishes or telecommunication devices shall be screened from public view and shall blend with the background of the building as practical. 
12.  In subarea A roof lines shall appear flat from the adjacent street and roof structures shall be vertically screened by a parapet wall. 
(g)  Facade and style standards. 
1.  Exterior facade materials shall be limited as follows: 
a.  Subarea A. Unpainted full-depth brick. 
b.  Subarea B. Full-depth brick, cast stone, hard-coat stucco, fiber-cement siding, natural-wood siding or stacked stone. 
c.  Subarea C. See neighborhood conservation area. 
d.  Remaining commercial/mixed-use area. Full-depth brick, cast stone, hard-coat stucco, fiber-cement siding, natural-wood siding or stacked stone. 
e.  Split-face block. In addition to the above materials, split-face block may be utilized on exterior facades, but only along a non-enfronting side or rear facade that is not visible from an adjacent street, public park, or plaza. 
f.  [Materials on enfronting facades.] The materials utilized along an enfronting facade shall be provided for the first 20 feet in length along adjacent non-enfronting facades. 
g.  [Façade colors, materials.] Facade colors and materials shall be limited to three per facade face. 
2.  Where allowed, the combined enfronting facade area covered with fiber-cement siding and/or natural-wood siding shall not exceed 20 percent of the total enfronting facade area, provided that: 
a.  Where a development includes only one building this requirement shall apply to said building. 
b.  Where a development includes two or more buildings this requirement shall apply to the sum of the total enfronting facade areas. This may result in individual buildings containing front facades entirely of fiber cement siding and/or natural wood siding. 
3.  Where allowed, hard-coat stucco shall have a smooth finish. Furthermore, architectural details such as sills, trim, pediments, cornices, railings, door enframements, or similar details shall not be of stucco. 
4.  In subarea A exterior building colors shall be consistent with the existing historic characteristics of each individual building as a contributing resource from its significant period of design and style. If the building was designed to be of natural or unique brick pattern, it should be returned to this style. All mortar and brick repairs should match the material and hue. Earth hues are suggested for paint, when used on most facades of brick construction, however there may be exceptions. A palette should be established on a building-by-building basis, with a suggested complimentary hue trim color to the base color. It is highly suggested the complete building color palette be limited to three colors for field and trim selections. Two adjacent buildings may use the same color palette only if the field and trim colors are reversed on each of the buildings. No sandblasting or abrasive cleaning methods (including high-pressure washes) shall be used on facades. Final review of selected color, restoration procedures, fixtures, and applications shall be coordinated on a building-by-building analysis through individual design review of visual concepts. The DRC shall make these determinations based on these standards, taking in consideration the style of the building, the nature and marketing of the applying business, the Main Street guidelines, the secretary of the interior's guidelines for renovation, section 93-2-7 et seq. of the zoning ordinance, and the standards for historic preservation. 
5.  Facade materials shall be combined horizontally, with the heavier below the lighter. 
6.  Enfronting upper and lowers facades shall be differentiated. Potential ways to achieve this include windows, belt courses, cornice lines or similar architectural details. This is intended to prevent buildings in which individual floors cannot be identified from the building exterior; it should not be interpreted to limit architectural expression. 
7.  Blank, windowless walls are prohibited along enfronting facades, except where a building enfronts multiple streets. In the latter case, it was not historically uncommon for buildings (especially commercial or mixed-use ones) to orient towards the more intensely developed street. As such, along the first story of enfronting mixed-use and commercial facades this requirement may be waived by the building official along streets that are predominantly residential in character when: 

a.  The first 20 feet of said facade meets the above requirements, and 
b.  The area beyond the first 20 feet is treated with architectural detailing, such as pilasters, false windows, or similar features. 
8.  Enfronting upper-story windows are encouraged to be equally sized, vertically oriented, equally spaced and arranged in a grid pattern. 
9.  Foundations shall be constructed as a distinct building element that contrast with facade materials. Foundations that are exposed above the ground, must be parged with cement, stuccoed over or be faced in full-depth brick, natural stone, or cast stone. 
10.  Vending machines, video or other outdoor merchandise displays, mechanical/electrical games, amusement rides, telephones, ice machines, freestanding automated teller machines excluding automated teller machines attached to buildings or integrated into buildings by canopies, and shopping carts shall be placed within the structure of a building and shall be out of view from the public right-of-way. 
11.  Safety pylons, bollards, and trash receptacles in the supplemental area or along an enfronting facade shall be permitted based upon design compatibility with the main facade and neighboring comparable facilities. 
(h)  Door and window standards. 
1.  The main entry door to enfronting principal buildings shall face, be visible from, and be accessible from the adjacent public sidewalk. 
2.  The main entry door to all uses shall be linked to the sidewalk via a pedestrian walkway or wheelchair access. 
3.  First-story doors or windows operating on sliders are only permitted when they open directly onto a required sidewalk or supplemental zone. 

4.  Building numbers, at least six inches in height, shall be located above or beside the street-facing pedestrian entrance. 
5.  Window panes serving commercial uses shall be recessed a minimum of three inches and a maximum of eight inches from the adjacent facade. 
6.  Where window lights are utilized they shall be true divided lights, simulated divided lights, or one-over-one lights. Grids between glass are prohibited. 
7.  Where used, window shutters shall match one-half the width of the window opening. 
8.  Enfronting windows shall be vertically shaped with a height greater than width, including display windows but not transoms. 
9.  Enfronting windows and door glass (except on churches and fire stations) shall utilize clear glass or tinted glass. Tinted glass shall have a transmittance factor of 50 percent or greater and shall have a visible light reflectance factor of ten or less. 
10.  Painted window or door glass is prohibited. 
11.  All enfronting "storefront and awning" treatments identified in Figure 3, and all enfronting facades along Atlanta Avenue, North Central Avenue, South Central Avenue, Virginia Avenue, Dogwood Drive (except within subarea C), and Sylvan Road shall provide a storefront consisting of: 
a.  A nonglass base or knee wall beginning at grade and extending not more than 24 inches above the sidewalk. 
b.  A glass display window beginning at the top of the bulkhead or knee wall, to a height not less than ten feet and not more than 12 feet above the adjacent required sidewalk. Such glass shall provide views into display windows having a minimum depth of two and one-half feet and that are accessible from the building interior. 
c.  A main entry door remaining unlocked during normal business hours, and having a surface area that is a minimum of 70 percent glass. 
d.  A glass transom located above the glass display window having a minimum height of 18 inches and a maximum height of 36 inches. 
e.  A minimum of 75 percent of the length of the enfronted portion of the build-to line shall be provided in glass, including glass doors and display windows. 

f.  No linear distance of more than ten feet without intervening glass display windows or glass doors. 
g.  First-story drop ceilings recessed a minimum of 18 inches from the display window opening. 
12.  Awnings projecting from buildings, serving as an entry canopy and/or providing identification to the business, are allowed, provided that: 
a.  Awnings shall be at least five feet deep as measured from the building's front facade. 
b.  Awnings serving as an entry canopy shall match adjacent business awnings in depth and height. 
c.  Valance width and height must align horizontally. 
d.  Frame construction on awnings should be square aluminum tubes. Thin, one-and-one-half-inch-diameter round aluminum tube frames are not permitted. It is suggested that Steel Stitch™ brand be used. 
e.  Valance on awnings should always be loose as valances should not be rigidly framed.

Sec. 81-1-8. - RSD and RMU zoned developments. 
Based on goals of this chapter, the following variations from and additions to these standards shall apply to sites zoned "Regionally Significant Development (RSD) and Residential Mixed Use (RMU)". Due to their size, and the opportunity to create self-contained "mini-cities" that this provides, these sites have an option to establish architecturally unique identities that may or may not reflect those of other parts of Hapeville. This is particularly true for those with mid-rise buildings, big box retail, convention center, warehouses, and telecommunication centers, which are not envisioned by the standards in section 81-1-6. 

(a)  General standards. 
(1)  The requirements of section 81-1-6 shall apply except as herein noted or varied by design exception. Where a conflict exists between sections 81-1-6 and 81-1-8, the requirements of 81-1-8 shall prevail. 
(2)  The requirements herein shall apply to all public and private streets. Exemptions to the requirements of section 81-1-6 relating to supplemental zones 
(3)  For master planned developments in excess of 30 acres, the Hapeville Architectural Design Standards may be substituted with independent architectural design standards, provided the substituted regulations are consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter, and subject to final approval by the design review committee. At a minimum, substitute design regulations shall include site development standards, utility standards, parking and traffic standards, and general facade standards, including but not limited to exterior materials, architectural themes, and street-level facade treatments. In the absence of these required elements, the minimum architectural standards will default to sections 81-1-6 and 81-1-8 respectively. 
(b)  Parking and traffic standards. Circular drives are permitted on new streets. 
(c)  Standards for low-rise buildings. See subsection (d)(1) for big box retail, conference/convention centers, warehouses, and telecommunication or data centers. 
(1)  Buildings four (4) stories of less are deemed low-rise. 
(2)  Standards for stories one and two: 
a.  Exterior materials shall be limited as follows: 

i.  Within 20 feet of public street rights-of-way or twenty (20) feet of the sidewalk along a private street: glass (except glass block), full-depth brick, cast stone, hard coat stucco, fiber cement siding, natural wood siding or stacked stone. 
ii.  Other locations: The above materials, plus half-depth brick and split-face block. 
(3)  Standards for stories three and four. 
a.  Exterior facade materials shall be limited to: glass (except glass block), metal, brick, simulated brick, precast concrete panels, cast stone, hard coat stucco, fiber cement siding, natural wood siding, stacked stone, half-depth brick, or split-face block. 
b.  There shall be no minimum recess distance from the facade for window panes serving commercial uses. 
c.  Windows shall be vertically shaped with a height greater than width. 
d.  Building floors shall not appear as single horizontal window bands separated by nonglass spandrels of equal or greater height than the windows. 
e.  Windows may utilize clear or tinted glass. Tinted glass may have any transmittance or light reflectance factor. 
(d)  Mid-rise building design standards. 
(1)  Buildings taller than four (4) stories are deemed midrise. 
(2)  Mid-rises shall have two- or three-part facades: 
a.  A two-part facade consists of: 
i.  A "base" zone (the lower stories); 
ii.  A "shaft" zone (all other floors). 
iii.  Zones may be differentiated by a change in facade materials, window pattern, or window material. They may also be separated by a cornice or expression line. 
b.  A three-part facade consists of: 
i.  A "base" zone (the lower stories); 
ii.  A "shaft" zone (middle stories); 
iii.  A "cap" zone (upper stories or cornice which provides a termination at the building top). 
iv.  Zones may be differentiated by a change in materials, window pattern, or window material. They may also be separated by a cornice or expression line. 
c.  Facade materials shall be arranged horizontally, with materials having a more visually heavy appearance placed below lighter ones. No more than two different materials or colors shall be used per facade zone. 
(e)  Big box retail, conference/convention centers, warehouse, telecommunication, and data center design standards. 
(1)  Big box retail, conference/convention centers, warehouse, and telecommunication or data centers shall comply with: 
a.  The requirements of subsection 81-1-8(c) "Low-rise buildings," or 
b.  The following requirements along each exterior facade visible from a public street, private street, private drive, or parking lot: 
i.  Materials shall be limited to: glass (except glass block), metal, brick, simulated brick, precast concrete panels, cast stone, hard coat stucco, fiber cement siding, natural wood siding, stacked stone, half-depth brick, or split-face block. 
ii.  Facade materials shall be combined only horizontally, with the heavier below the lighter. 
iii.  A minimum of 30 percent of the facade area shall be glass. Such glass shall allow visibility into the building a minimum depth of five feet. Display windows shall count towards this requirement. 
iv.  Facades over 100 feet in length shall incorporate wall projections or recesses a minimum of five feet in depth and a minimum of 20 contiguous feet in length per 100 feet of facade length. The combined length of said recesses and projections shall constitute more than 20 percent but less than thirty (40) percent of the total facade length.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2014-11 , § 1, adopted October 7, 2014, amended chapter 90 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, chapter 90 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from the Code of 1981, §§ 8-4-1—8-4-6, and Ord. No. 2013-08, §§ 2, 3, adopted July 16, 2003. 
State Law reference— Authority of municipality to adopt and enforce subdivision regulations, Ga. Code Ann., Sec. 69-1214 et seq. 

Sec. 90-1-1. - Purpose, authority and jurisdiction. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development. Once land has been cut up into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility, in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects. It is therefore to the interest of the public, the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards. 
(2)  The major street plan, of which certified copies were filed in the office of the city clerk and the following standards guiding the planning commission are designed to provide for the harmonious development of the area; to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provisions for traffic; and also to secure adequate provision for light, air, recreation, transportation, water, drainage, sewer and other sanitary facilities. 
(b)  Authority. These subdivision regulations are adopted under the authority granted by the laws of the state. The planning commission has fulfilled the requirements set forth in state law as prerequisites to the adoption of these regulations. 
(c)  Jurisdiction. These regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within the corporate limits of the city as now or hereafter established. Within these regulations, the term "subdivision" shall mean the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, sites or divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building development, and includes resubdivision and, when appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or area subdivided. Any owner of land within this area wishing to subdivide land shall submit to the planning commission a plat of the subdivision according to the procedures outlined in section 90-1-2, which plat shall conform to the minimum requirements set forth in section 90-1-3. Improvements shall be installed as required by section 90-1-4 of these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2014-11 , § 1, 10-7-2014) 
Sec. 90-1-2. - Procedure for plat approval. 
(a)  Preliminary plat preparation and submission. The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of the preparation and submittal of a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision to planning commission. 
(b)  Final plat preparation and submission. A final plat, including the required certificates, may be submitted to planning commission following approval of a preliminary plat. The final plat becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court when duly signed by the secretary of the planning commission. 
(c)  Consultation/technical advisory. The subdivider should consult city staff for advice and assistance before preparing the preliminary plat and its formal application for approval. This will enable the subdivider to become thoroughly familiar with these regulations, the major street plan and other official plans for public improvements which might affect the area. Such informal review should minimize unnecessary delays and costly revisions. 
(d)  General. 
(1)  Any owner of land lying within the city wishing to divide that land into two or more lots, or to resubdivide land, shall submit a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision to the planning commission for approval and shall obtain approval prior to the filing of a final subdivision plat. Any such plat of subdivision shall conform to the minimum standards of design for the subdivision of land as set forth in section 90-1-3 of these regulations and shall be presented in the manner specified in this chapter. No subdivision plat shall be filed or recorded by the clerk of the superior court of Fulton County without the approval of the planning commission as specified herein. 
(2)  In order to secure review and approval of the planning commission of a proposed subdivision, the prospective subdivider shall, prior to the making of any street improvements or installations of utilities, submit to the planning commission a preliminary plat as provided in subsection (e) below. Upon approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider may proceed with preparation of the final plat and other required documents as specified in subsection (f) and the improvements set forth in section 90-1-4. 
(e)  Preliminary plat. 
(1)  A minimum of five days prior to the meeting at which the preliminary plat is to be considered, the subdivider shall submit two copies of the preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals 100 feet to the planning commission. 
(2)  The preliminary plat shall meet the minimum standards of design and the general requirements for the construction of public improvements as set forth in section 90-1-3 and shall contain the following information insofar as possible: 
a.  The proposed subdivision name and location, name and address of the owner or owners, and name of the author of the plat who shall be a state-registered engineer or land surveyor. 
b.  Date, approximate north point and graphic scale. 
c.  The location of existing and platted property lines, streets, buildings, watercourses, railroads, sewers, bridges, culverts, drain pipes, water mains and any public utility easements; the present zoning classification of the land to be subdivided and the adjoining land; and the names of adjoining property owners or subdivisions. 
d.  Plans of proposed underground utility layouts (including sewers, water mains and electrical service) showing feasible connections to the existing or any proposed utility systems. 
e.  The names, locations, widths and other dimensions of proposed streets, alleys, easements, parks and other open spaces, reservations, lot lines and utilities. 
f.  Contours at vertical intervals of not more than five feet. 
g.  The acreage of the land to be subdivided and acreage of any lots to be created. 
h.  Location map showing the relationship of subdivision to area. 
(3)  Within 30 days after submission of the preliminary plat, the planning commission will review the plat and indicate its approval, denial or approval subject to modifications as a basis for preparation of the final plat. If a plat is denied, reasons for the denial will be indicated in writing. If approved subject to modifications, the nature of the required modifications will also be indicated in writing. 
(4)  Approval of the preliminary plat by the planning commission will not constitute acceptance of the final plat and will not be indicated on the preliminary plat. 
(5)  Failure of planning commission to act on the preliminary plat within 30 days of the meeting at which the preliminary plat was first considered will be deemed approval of this plat. 
(6)  One copy of the preliminary plat shall be retained by the planning commission secretary. The second copy will be returned to the subdivider with any notations at the time of approval or denial and the specific modifications, if any, required. 
(7)  Approval of the preliminary plat shall lapse and become null and void unless a final plat based thereon is submitted within one year from the date of such approval. The planning commission may grant an extension of time not to exceed 180 days upon good cause shown. 
(f)  Final plat. 
(1)  The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat proposed for recording and development at the time; provided, however, that any portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations. 
(2)  a.  A minimum of five days prior to the planning commission meeting at which it is to be considered, the subdivider shall submit an electronic file and the original drawing in black ink and three copies (black and white prints), together with any street profiles or other plans that may be required by planning commission. 
b.  The plat shall be drawn to a scale of one-inch equals 100 feet on sheets not larger than 22 inches by 34 inches or an approved size to correspond to local plat book dimensions. When more than one sheet is required, an index sheet of the same size shall be filed showing the entire subdivision with the sheets lettered in alphabetical order as a key. 
c.  When the plat has been approved by the planning commission, one copy will be returned to the subdivider, with the approval of the planning commission certified thereon, for filing with the clerk of superior court as the official plat of record. One copy containing the certification of the planning commission will be returned to the subdivider and the planning commission secretary shall retain the other two copies. 
(3)  The planning commission shall approve or deny a final plat within 30 days of the date upon which the plat was first considered by the planning commission. Failure of the planning commission to act on the final plat within these 30 days shall be deemed approval. In the event a final plat is denied, the grounds for denial shall be stated in the records of the planning commission. 
(4)  Approval of the final plat by the planning commission shall not constitute acceptance by the city of dedication of any streets, easements or other public way, ground or improvements. 
The final plat shall show: 
a.  The lines of all streets, roads, and allies, lot lines, building setback lines, lots numbered in numerical order, house numbers, reservations, easements and any areas to be dedicated to public use or sites for other than residential use with notes stating their purpose and any limitations.

(Ord. No. 2014-11 , § 1, 10-7-2014) 
Sec. 90-1-3. - General requirements and minimum standards of design. 
(a)  Streets. 
(1)  Conformity to the major street plan. The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to the official major street plan. 
(2)  Relation to adjoining street systems. The proposed street system shall extend existing streets or projects at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width. 
(3)  Street widths. The minimum width of right-of-way, measured from lot line to lot line, shall be as shown on the major street plan, or if not shown on that plan, shall be not less than as follows: 
a.  For major streets, 70 feet as may be required. Major streets are those regional roads to be used primarily for fast or heavy traffic and will be located on the major street plan. 
b.  For arterial streets, 60 feet. Arterial streets are those which carry traffic from minor streets to the major streets and include the principal streets utilized for local circulation. 
c.  For minor and collector residential streets, 50 feet. Minor streets are those which are used primarily for access to the abutting residential properties and designed to discourage their use by through traffic. Collector residential streets are those which carry traffic from residential streets to arterial streets. 
d.  For dead-end streets (culs-de-sac), 50 feet. Culs-de-sac are permanent dead-end streets or courts designed so that they cannot be extended in the future. "Hammerhead" turnarounds are also permitted on dead-end streets accessing low density neighborhoods. 
e.  For alleys, ten feet to 16 feet. Alleys are minor public ways used primarily for service access to the back or side of properties otherwise abutting on a street. In cases where topography or other typical physical conditions make a street of the required minimum width impracticable, the planning commission may modify the above requirements. Through proposed business areas the street widths shall be increased ten feet on each side if needed to provide parking without interference of normal passing traffic. 
(4)  Additional width on existing streets. Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the above minimum street width requirements. 
a.  The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street. 
b.  When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the centerline of the existing roadway, shall be provided. 
(5)  Restriction of access. When a tract fronts on an arterial street or highway, the planning commission may require those lots to be provided with frontage on an access street. 
(6)  Street grades. Grades on major streets shall not exceed seven percent. Grades on other streets may exceed seven percent but not ten percent. 
(7)  Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long radius shall be introduced. On streets 60 feet or more in width, the centerline radius of curvature shall be not less than 300 feet; on other streets not less than 100 feet. 
(8)  Vertical curves. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of minimum length in feet equal to 15 times the algebraic difference in rates of grade for major streets and one-half this minimum length for other streets. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals 100 feet horizontal, and one-inch equals 20 feet vertical, may be required by the planning commission. 
(9)  Intersections. 
a.  Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than 60 degrees. 
b.  Property line radii at street intersections shall not be less than 20 feet and where the angle of street intersection is less than 75 degrees, the planning commission may require a greater curb radius. Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the property line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such construction. 
(10)  Tangents. A tangent of at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
(11)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be prohibited. 
(12)  Dead-end streets. 
a.  Minor terminal streets or courts designed to have one end permanently closed shall be no more than 400 feet long unless necessitated by topography. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet and a street right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet. "Hammerhead" turnarounds are also permitted on dead-end streets accessing low density neighborhoods. 
b.  Where, in the opinion of the planning commission, it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of the property. These dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turnaround having a roadway diameter of at least 80 feet. 
(13)  Private streets and reserve strips. There shall be no private streets platted in any subdivision. Every subdivided property shall be served from a publicly dedicated street. There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where the control of such strips is definitely placed with the community under conditions approved by the planning commission. 
(14)  Street names. Proposed streets in obvious alignment with others already existing and named shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case shall the name for proposed streets duplicate existing street names, irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, driveway, place or court. 
(15)  Alleys. Alleys shall be provided to the rear of lots used for business purposes, and shall not be provided in residential blocks except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys. 
(b)  Blocks. 
(1)  Length. Blocks shall not be less than 400 feet or more than 1,200 feet in length, except as the planning commission considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of street pattern. In blocks over 800 feet in length, the planning commission may require one or more public cross walks of not less than ten feet in width to extend entirely across the block and at locations deemed necessary. 
(2)  Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where fronting on major streets or prevented by topographical conditions or size of the property, in which case the planning commission will approve a single tier of lots of minimum depth. 
(c)  Lots. 
(1)  Arrangement. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot shall have frontage on a public street. 
(2)  Minimum size. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be such as the planning commission deems appropriate for the type of development and use contemplated. Remnant lots, that is, parcels of land that would not comply with the minimum lot area or width following subdividing shall be prohibited. Such remnant parcels shall be added to adjacent lots rather than be platted as unusable parcels. 
a.  The size and widths of lots shall in no case be less than the minimum requirements of the zoning ordinance. No lot shall have a width greater than six times the lot depth at the building setback line without specific approval by the planning commission. 
b.  Size of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial properties shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. Platting of individual lots should be avoided in favor of an overall design of the land to be used for such purposes. 
(3)  Minimum depth. The minimum depth of building setback lines from the right-of-way shall not be less than 30 feet and in the case of corner lots 15 feet from the side street right-of-way unless a lower standard is allowed by an existing zoning ordinance. 
(4)  Corner lot dimension. Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and larger to permit the additional side yard requirements of the zoning ordinance or building setback lines outlined above. 
(5)  Lots on a curved street or cul-de-sac. All such lots shall comply with the minimum lot frontage at the building setback line. No lot shall have a lot width less than 35 feet at the street right-of-way. 
(6)  Lots in more than one municipality. No new lot created subsequent to the effective date of this chapter shall be divided by a city boundary line. 
(7)  Double frontage lots. No lot, other than a corner lot, shall have frontage on more than one street unless a reserve strip that would prohibit vehicle access is created. 
(d)  Public use and service areas. Due consideration shall be given to the allocation of areas suitably located and of adequate size for playgrounds and parks for local or neighborhood use as well as public service areas. Plats indicating dedication of park and playground areas to the city shall be approved conditionally subject to the written acceptance of the land by mayor and council. 
(1)  Public open spaces. Where a school, neighborhood park or recreation area or public access to water frontage, shown on an official map or in a plan made and adopted by the planning commission, is located in whole or in part in the applicant's subdivision, the planning commission may require the dedication or reservation of such open space within the subdivision up to a total of ten percent of the gross area or water frontage of the lot, for park, school or recreation purposes. 
(2)  Easements for utilities. Except where alleys are permitted for the purpose, the planning commission may require easements, not less than ten feet in width, for wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water and heat mains or other utility lines, along all rear lot lines, along side lot lines if necessary, or if, in the opinion of the planning commission, advisable. Easements of the same or greater width may be required along the lines of or across lots, where necessary for the extension of existing or planned utilities. Easements greater than ten feet in width may be required where additional utilities, utilities larger in size or utilities greater than five feet in depth below grade are proposed in the easement. 
(3)  Community assets. In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for all natural features such as large trees, watercourses, historical resources and similar community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the property. 
(e)  Suitability of the land. 
(1)  The planning commission shall not approve the subdivision of land if, from adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has been determined that in the best interest of the public the site is not suitable for platting and development purposes of the kind proposed. 
(2)  Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically unsuitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy, or for any other uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate erosion or flood hazard. Such land within the plat shall be set aside for those uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not produce unsatisfactory living conditions. 
(f)  Large tracts or parcels. When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, those parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets and logical further resubdivision. 
(g)  Group housing developments. A comprehensive group housing development, including single-family attached developments and the large-scale construction of housing units together with necessary drives and ways of access, may be approved by the planning commission although the design of the project does not include standard street, lot and subdivision arrangements, if departure from the foregoing standards can be made without destroying their intent. 
(h)  Variances. Where the subdivider can show that a provision of these standards would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to, and where, because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, in the opinion of the planning commission, a departure may be made without destroying the intent of these provisions, the planning commission may authorize a variance. Any variance thus authorized is to be stated in writing in the minutes of the planning commission with the reasoning on which the departure was justified set forth.

(Ord. No. 2014-11 , § 1, 10-7-2014) 
Sec. 90-1-4. - Development prerequisite to final approval. 
(a)  Required improvements. Every subdivision developer shall be required to grade and improve streets and alleys, install curbs and sidewalks, monuments, sewers, stormwater inlets and water mains in accordance with specifications established by the city. 
(1)  Monuments. 
a.  Concrete monuments four inches in diameter or square, three feet long, with a flat top, shall be set at all street corners, at all points where the street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision, and at angle points and points of curve in each street. The top of the monument shall have an indented cross to identify properly the location and shall be set flush with the finished grade. 
b.  All other lot corners shall be marked with iron pipe not less than three-fourths inch in diameter and 24 inches long and driven so as to be flush with the finished grade. 
(2)  Grading. All streets, roads and alleys shall be graded to their full width by the subdivider so that pavements and sidewalks can be constructed on the same level plane. Due to special topographical conditions, deviation to the above will be allowed only with special approval of planning commission. 
a.  Preparation. Before grading is started, the entire right-of-way area shall be first cleared of all stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable materials and all trees not intended for preservation. 
b.  Cuts. All tree stumps, boulders and other obstructions shall be removed to a depth of two feet below the subgrade. Rock, when encountered, shall be scarified to a depth of 12 inches below the subgrade. 
c.  Fill. All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the construction of fills, approaches, or at other places as needed. Excess materials, including organic materials, soft clays, etc., shall be removed from the development site. The fill shall be spread in layers not to exceed 12 inches loose and compacted by a sheep's foot roller. The filling of utility trenches and other places not accessible to a roller shall be mechanically tamped, but where water is used to assist compaction the water content shall not exceed the optimum of moisture. 
(3)  Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural water flow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit full width roadway and the required slopes. The size openings to be provided shall be determined by Talbot's formula, but in no case shall the pipe be less than 12 inches. Cross drains shall be built on straight lines and grade, and shall be laid on a firm base but not on rock. Pipes shall be laid with the spigot end pointing in the direction of the flow and with the ends fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a smooth uniform invert. They shall be placed at a sufficient depth below the roadbed to avoid dangerous pressure of impact, and in no case shall the top of the pipe be less than one foot below the roadbed. In all cases, drainage improvement plans and the improvements themselves shall be approved by the city engineer. 
Drainage system design shall be in accordance with the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual published by ARC, latest update, unless approved otherwise. Drainage systems shall also comply with all other applicable city ordinances and regulations, including the floodplain management ordinance, post development stormwater management regulations and the erosion and sediment control ordinance. Drainage construction shall comply with the state department of transportation standard specifications unless approved otherwise. Storm drain pipe material within city street rights-of-way shall be reinforced concrete pipe in accordance with state department of transportation specifications. 
(4)  Roadway surfacing. After preparation of the subgrade, the roadbed shall be surfaced with material required by local standards, but of no lower classification than crushed rock, stone or gravel. The size of the crushed rock or stone shall be that generally known as crushed rock stone from two and one-half inches down including dust. Spreading of the stone shall be done uniformly over the area to be covered by means of appropriate spreading devices and shall not be dumped in piles. After spreading, the stone shall be rolled until thoroughly compacted. The compacted thickness of the stone roadway shall be no less than six inches. 
Following application of a crushed stone base having a minimum thickness of six inches, contractor shall provide surface paving of local and minor residential streets consisting of two inches of 19 mm Superpave asphalt. Upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy for 90 percent of the dwellings served by the street have been built, or prior to the end of the one-year maintenance period (but after the 11th month), whichever occurs first, contractor shall provide a final wearing course of one and one-half inch of 12.5 mm Superpave asphalt paving. All paving materials shall meet the requirements of the state department of transportation standard specifications. 
(5)  Minimum pavement widths. Due to the diversity of development in the city, required pavement widths will necessarily vary with the character of building development and the amount of traffic encountered. Minimum pavement widths between curbs shall be as follows: 
a.  For minor residential streets, 30 feet. Most minor streets in residential developments. 
b.  For collector streets, 36 feet. Including minor streets which in the opinion of the planning commission will involve sufficient traffic and/or parking to justify the width. 
c.  For arterial streets and highways, as may be required. 
(6)  Curbs and gutters. Except on rural streets, the subdivider shall provide permanent six-inch concrete curbs with 24-inch integral concrete gutters or standard rolled curb and gutters. 
(7)  Sidewalks. 
a.  For the safety of pedestrians and of children at play, installation by the developer of sidewalks on both sides of streets will normally be required. The commission may waive the requirements of sidewalks along streets where a park, railroad or other use on one side of a street makes a sidewalk nonessential. 
b.  Sidewalks shall be located not less than one foot from the property line to prevent interference or encroachment by fencing, walls, hedges or other planting or structures placed on the property line at a later date. In single-family residential areas and multifamily or group housing developments, concrete sidewalks shall be five feet wide and four inches thick. Sidewalks in commercial areas shall be five feet wide and ten feet wide as dictated by adjoining sidewalk widths. 
(8)  Installation of utilities. After grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied, all of the work for underground utilities including water mains, gas mains, electrical lines, etc., and all service connections shall be installed completely and approved throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. All driveways for houses to be built by the developer shall be cut and drained. 
(9)  Water supply system. 
a.  Water mains properly connected with the city water supply system shall be constructed in such a manner as to adequately serve all lots shown on the subdivision plat for both domestic use and fire protection. Water mains shall be located on public property and not private property. 
b.  The sizes of water mains, the location and types of valves and hydrants, the amount of soil cover over the pipes and other features of the installation shall be approved by the city engineer and fire chief. 
(10)  Sanitary sewers. Sanitary sewers shall be installed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots with connection to the public system, according to plans approved by the city engineer. 
(b)  Recommended improvements. The planting of street trees and installation of street name signs is considered a duty of the subdivider as well as good business practice. 
(1)  Street trees. 
a.  Street trees are a protection against excessive heat and glare and enhance the attractiveness and value of abutting property. The planning commission will assist the subdivider in location of trees and species to use under varying conditions. 
b.  It is recommended that trees be planted inside the property lines where they are less subject to injury, decrease the chance of motor accidents and enjoy more favorable conditions for growth. If trees are to be planted within a planting strip in the right-of-way, their proposed locations and species to be used must be submitted for the planning commission's approval since the public inherits the care and maintenance of such trees. 
(c)  Guarantees in lieu of completed improvements. No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the planning commission or accepted for record by the clerk of the superior court until the improvements listed shall be constructed in satisfactory manner and approved by the city engineer, or in lieu of such prior construction, the planning commission may accept a security bond in an amount equal to the estimated cost of installation of the required improvements, whereby improvements may be made and utilities installed without cost to the city in the event of default by the subdivider. 
(Ord. No. 2014-11 , § 1, 10-7-2014) 
Sec. 90-1-5. - Enforcement and penalties for violations. 
(a)  Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of these regulations shall be deemed guilty of an offense and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as provided in the City Charter. Each day's continuance of a violation shall be considered a separate offense. The owner of any lands or parts thereof, where anything in violation of these regulations shall be placed or shall exist, or any builder, contractor or agent of the owner who may have assisted in the commission of any violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense. 
(b)  In any violation in which any land is or is proposed to be used in violation of these regulations or amendment thereto adopted by the mayor and council, the legal counsel of the city or any owner of real estate therein may, in addition to other remedies provided by law, institute injunction, abatement or any appropriate action or actions, proceeding or proceedings to prevent, enjoin or abate such unlawful use. 
(Ord. No. 2014-11 , § 1, 10-7-2014) 
Sec. 90-1-6. - Adoption and effective date. 
(a)  Before adoption of these subdivision regulations or any amendment thereof, a public hearing thereon shall be held by the mayor and council; 15 days notice of the time and place of which shall be given by one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
(b)  These rules and regulations shall be in full force and effect from and after their adoption and effective date.

Sec. 93-1-3. - Application of regulations. 
(a)  Use. Except as hereinafter provided, no building or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building or part thereof shall be erected, moved or altered except in conformity with the use regulations herein specified for the zone in which it is located. 
(1)  Where a use is applied for in a zone and such use is not listed in the list of specifically permitted uses allowed per zone, the building official may exercise his/her discretion to: 
a.  Deny the use as unpermitted in accordance with subsection (a)(1) above and the list of permitted uses per zone; or 
b.  Allow the use if such use is substantially like a use which is already listed in the permitted use section per zone. 
(2)  The building official shall consider the following factors to determine substantial similarities between the nonpermitted uses and permitted uses in occupations, residences, types of businesses, and other uses by applying the following standard, based upon the following considerations: 
a.  The proposed use generates the same or similar amounts in type of vehicular and pedestrian traffic as permitted uses in the desired zone; 
b.  The proposed use is aesthetically similar in design, construction, and street facade presentation as permitted uses in the desired zone; 
c.  The proposed use is no more taxing on city services and infrastructure than permitted uses in the desired zone; 
d.  The proposed use provides the same or similar activity, work, or business as permitted uses in the desired zone; 
e.  The proposed use comports with the listed purposes in the intent section of the desired zone; 
f.  The proposed use will not introduce activity at times of the day or week that are incompatible with normal hours associated with permitted uses in the desired zone; and 
g.  The proposed use is consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan. 
(3)  The applicant is responsible for submitting evidence and information establishing the comparative similarities set forth above upon application for the desired zoning or use approval. 
(4)  A decision of the building official to deny a previously nonlisted use is appealable to the board of appeals pursuant to subsection 87-3-3(a)(1). The standard of review used by the board of appeals shall be a determination of whether or not the building official erred in his decision based upon the purposes of the zone as stated in the ordinance and the consistency of the proposed use as compared to other allowed uses. 
(b)  Height and density. Except as hereinafter provided, no building shall hereafter be erected or altered so as to exceed the height limit, nor shall any building or land be used or occupied hereafter in excess of the maximum density requirements of article 22.1 of this chapter for the zone in which it is located.

Sec. 93-2-5. - Accessory uses, accessory buildings, yard requirements of accessory buildings, outbuildings and fences. 
(1)  An accessory building or structure is an uninhabited building detached from the principal dwelling on a lot of record, the use of which is incidental and subordinate to the primary use of the property. Accessory buildings shall comply with the following standards and all other applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance and the architectural design standards. Where a conflict exists, the standards of this section shall control. 
Accessory uses and structures on a residential lot shall comply with the following standards and all other applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance: 
(a)  The accessory use or structure shall be subordinate in area, extent and purpose to the primary use or structure served. No accessory structure shall have a ground floor area greater than that of the principal dwelling. The floor area of an accessory structure shall include all floor area, that is, each floor of a one and one-half or two story accessory building shall be counted toward the maximum floor area. When more than one accessory building is erected, the "maximum accessory building size" controls the sum of the floor areas of those buildings. 
(b)  The accessory use or structure shall contribute to the comfort, convenience or necessity of the occupants of the principal use or structure served. 
(c)  The accessory use or structure shall not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of surrounding properties. 
(d)  No accessory building shall be erected or placed on a lot that does not contain a principal dwelling. Building permits may be issued for the principal dwelling and an accessory structure; however, a certificate of occupancy must be issued for the principal dwelling prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for an accessory structure. 
Special requirements for accessory buildings are as follows: 
(a)  In residentially zoned areas, no space in an accessory structure can be rented or leased unless the primary structure and accessory structure are rented or leased in their entirety to the same individual. 
(b)  A building permit shall be required for the construction, erection or set-up of any accessory building in excess of 144 square feet. A separate certificate of occupancy shall be required for the construction, erection or set up of any accessory building in excess of 200 square feet. Accessory structures less than 200 square feet, without HVAC, shall be exempt from obtaining a separate certificate of occupancy, but shall not be exempt from all necessary inspections during the construction process.

(e)  Exterior materials, roof pitches, and other design elements must comply with the city architectural design standards. 
(f)  Except as herein provided, the minimum yard requirements of section 93-22.1-1 of this chapter also apply to accessory buildings. However, accessory buildings may be located in rear yards within five feet of a rear or side lot line. In addition to these yard requirements, the horizontal separation of accessory buildings from the dwelling on the same lot and the horizontal separation of accessory buildings from dwelling on adjacent lots shall comply with standards in Table C—Distance from Dwelling for Very Large Accessory Buildings. All distances shall be measured from outside wall to outside wall. 
(g)  The number of accessory building may vary depending on the size of the lot. Table D—Maximum Number of Accessory Buildings establishes the schedule for number of accessory buildings allowed on a building lot. 
(h)  Accessory buildings, including detached garages, shall be permitted in an R-0, R-AD, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-I, R-SF, V, U-V, RMU or C-R Zone, subject to the following limitations: 
Placement. 
(a)  Located on a lot with a principal dwelling. An accessory building shall be located on the same lot as the principal dwelling to which it is accessory. 
(b)  Setback dependent on distance from dwelling. Accessory buildings shall be allowed in rear yards only, provided that garages may be allowed in front and side yards. An accessory building located within 20 feet of the principal dwelling shall comply with the setback requirements of the principal dwelling to which it is accessory. Accessory buildings located more than 20 feet from the principal dwelling may be placed five feet from a side or rear lot line. Garages may be located in the front or side yard subject to the setback standards for the principal dwelling. 
(c)  Setback on corner lot. Accessory buildings on a corner lot shall comply with the setback for the principal dwelling. No accessory building on a corner lot that adjoins a residentially used or zoned lot to the rear shall be located within 25 feet of the rear property line. This 25-foot setback will not be required when the adjoining yard is a rear yard. 
(d)  Distance from dwelling and other accessory buildings. All accessory buildings must be located a minimum of ten feet from the principal dwelling and all other accessory buildings on the lot or on neighboring lots. This distance shall be measured from outside wall to outside wall. 
(e)  Ordinance setbacks otherwise remain in effect. Except as herein provided, the minimum setback requirements of section 93-22.1-1 of this chapter also apply to accessory buildings. 
(f)  Non-complying accessory buildings. Notwithstanding standards of this chapter to the contrary, nothing shall prohibit the re-construction of accessory buildings that are legal, nonconforming structures that have been in existence for a minimum of 20 years along that established building line. That building line shall be the minimum setback for re-building of the accessory building on the lot. All other standards of the chapter shall remain in effect. 
Height. 
(a)  Scale of accessory buildings. The height of an accessory building shall not exceed 25 feet or the height of the principal dwelling measured from the average adjacent grade to the peak or ridgeline of the roof, whichever is less.

Use. 
(a)  Residential occupancy of any kind prohibited. No accessory building shall be used for human habitation, including, but not limited to, overnight accommodations for any person. Accessory buildings may be used as home offices, recreation rooms or non-commercial storage. No accessory building shall be used for the operation of any business, except as permitted under section 93-1-2, home occupation that allows home offices. No commercial or industrial use shall be permitted in a residential accessory building. 
(b)  Evidence of separate dwelling unit. The presence of such facilities or equipment as utility services, utility meters, mailboxes or kitchen equipment such as a sink, stove, oven or cabinets in an accessory building or a portion of a principal dwelling shall be considered prima facie evidence that such accessory building or such portion of a principal dwelling is a separate and distinct dwelling unit and is subject to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(c)  Temporary buildings. Temporary buildings may only be used in conjunction with permitted construction work in any zoning district and shall be removed immediately upon the completion of construction.

(b)  Life safety codes apply. Accessory buildings must comply with adopted fire safety and building code regulations. 
(c)  Standards for "attached" accessory building. When an accessory building is attached to the principal dwelling by a breezeway, passageway or similar means, the accessory building shall comply with the setback requirements of the principal dwelling to which it is accessory. In order to qualify as an attached garage or accessory building, therefore eliminating the need for compliance with these accessory building standards, the attached accessory building must share a common wall with the principal dwelling that is a minimum of 80 percent of the wall length of the accessory building or 20 feet, whichever is greater. Such common wall must be an integral part of the principal dwelling. An attached garage or accessory building shall comply in all respects with the standards applicable to the principal dwelling.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2016-08 , § 1(Exh. A), adopted April 5, 2016, repealed and reenacted article 3.3 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, article 3.3, divisions 1 and 2, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2014-07 , §§ 1—3, adopted August 19, 2004, and Ord.

DIVISION 1. - SIGNS 

Sec. 93-3.3-1. - Statement of purpose and intent. 
(a)  This division seeks to create the legal framework necessary to ensure a comprehensive and balanced system of signs within the city. A comprehensive regulation is necessary to ensure that signs installed in the city are compatible with the unique nature and character of the community. The purpose of this division is to preserve the right of free speech and expression, facilitate appropriate communication between people and their environment, promote the public health, safety and welfare, and avoid the visual clutter that is potentially harmful to traffic and pedestrian safety, property values, business opportunities, and community appearance. 
With these concepts in mind, the provisions in this division, which regulate signs by such factors as design, size, height, spacing and location, but not on the basis of any message conveyed by such signs, and also regulate the maintenance of signs, are hereby established to achieve the following purposes: 
(1)  To protect the health, safety, general welfare and property values of residents and property owners of the city. 
(2)  To promote and implement the goals, objectives and policies adopted in the comprehensive plan. 
(3)  To effectively balance public and private objectives by allowing adequate signs for the needs of business and developers. 
(4)  To regulate the installation and placement of signs in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrians and motorists by eliminating unsafe, cluttered, distracting, or illegal signs. 
(5)  To promote the use of signs that are aesthetically pleasing, of appropriate scale, integrated with surrounding buildings and landscape, and compatible with the character of the surrounding area. 
(6)  To ensure the protection of free speech rights provided by the United States Constitution and the Georgia Constitution. 
(b)  It is the intent of this division to: 
(1)  Enable the public to locate and design sign facilities without difficulty or confusion. 
(2)  Provide functional flexibility, encourage variety and relate signing to basic principles of good design. 
(3)  Balance the rights of individuals to convey messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs by regulating signs on the basis of such factors as design, height, spacing, and location, but not on the basis of the content of any message conveyed thereby. 
(4)  Provide an enhanced visual environment for residents and visitors and protect existing view sheds in the community. 
(5)  Promote economic development. 
(6)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

DIVISION 2. - MURALS 

Sec. 93-3.3-27. - Statement of purpose and intent. 
A mural is a work of art painted otherwise directly applied on a building or wall. The presence of works of art, including murals, can be a key element to creating a visually satisfying environment for a community. The city is likely to attract commercial enterprises, permanent residents, and visitors if it improves and maintains its overall appearance. The residents ultimately will benefit from enhanced retail and commercial environments and improvements in the quality of life if an attractive environment exists. The existence of works of art, such as murals, is an invaluable element to creating and maintain a visually appealing setting, which will promote economic development, advance the general prosperity of the community, and serve the general welfare. This is particularly true for the city, which has concentrated residential and commercial areas where murals are more readily noticed and appreciated than such works of art would be in municipalities with geographically large areas. 
The purpose of this division is to recognize the following mural types: (1) historic murals; (2) original art murals; and (3) limited message murals. All other similar forms of outdoor visual art that do not meet the definitions of these three forms of murals set forth herein shall be regulated as wall signs under division 1 of this article pertaining to signs.

Otherwise, such application shall be denied. 
(d)  In ruling on any petition in which the petitioner has brought a challenge of the existing zoning classification, the mayor and council may impose upon such property any appropriate zoning classification, including provisions allowed by section 93-25-7, which might be consistent with the considerations contained in (a) above. 
(Code 1981, § 8-5-266; Ord. No. 97-05, § 1, 7-8-1997) 
Sec. 93-25-7. - Conditions on zoning. 
(a)  In deciding upon any application for zoning map amendment, the mayor and council may, on their own motion or upon the suggestion of the applicant, grant the application subject to certain conditions necessary to promote and protect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the city. Such conditions shall be imposed for the benefit of the community to lessen any negative effects that the zoning map amendment may cause. 
(b)  The mayor and council may grant any zoning map amendment and include condition as follows: 
(1)  Such conditions as are deemed necessary to protect neighbors and to lessen any negative effects of the zoning change; 
(2)  That the rezoning is conditional and that the applicant or any successor in title may construct only those uses and only in such a manner as is depicted upon any site plan submitted and approved with the application.

(d)  If the mayor and council adopt a zoning map amendment which contains conditional requirements, such requirements shall become a part of the zoning ordinance and the official zoning map. Such property shall thereafter carry the suffix "-C" to indicate that such property has been conditionally zoned (e.g., R-1-C, I-1-C etc.). Such conditions shall be binding upon all owners of the property until removed or modified by the mayor and council. The building official shall so indicate in the records of the zoning actions the existence of the conditional requirements. The suffix "-C" shall be affixed to the zoning map for the appropriate property. 
(e)  A conditional requirement may be imposed upon either permitted and/or conditional uses in any zoning district. In ruling on such conditional requirements, the mayor and council shall utilize the applicable standards of review contained in section 93-25-6. 
(f)  In those instances where a rezoning is granted which is conditional upon the submitted site plan, such property shall revert to its former zoning classification by operation of law if a building permit for such development has not been applied for within one year, provided that the mayor and council, at a zoning hearing, may extend this period for good cause shown by the property owner. The building official may grant "minor" changes to such site plans if the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The developer can show a hardship requiring such modifications; and 
(2)  The building official determines that the changes so requested do not materially affect the basis design nor negate any special features which were an integral component of the plan. 
(g)  It shall be the duty of the building official to review on a quarterly basis such conditional rezoning and to report to the mayor and council those rezoning actions which have reverted by operation of law.

ARTICLE 28. - A-D ZONE (ARTS DISTRICT OVERLAY) 

Sec. 93-28-1. - Factual basis. 
In adopting the Hapeville Arts District Overlay Zone (the "arts district overlay"), the city seeks to reinvent itself as a cultural destination, particularly its walkable downtown. The downtown has declined over the past 40 or more years. Likely the primary driver of that decline was expansion of Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the 1980's. This expansion removed half the city's land base and nearly half the population having devastating impacts on retail trade and service industries. Secondary factors were the building of the interstate system that served as a bypass for travelers. This effectively eliminated Hapeville as a recipient of a very significant consumer market generated by east coast travelers and local commuters. Hapeville has also suffered from the general lack of investment characterizing Atlanta's Southside, reinforced by a failure of Southside incomes and housing values to keep pace with Atlanta's north side. Finally, closure of the Hapeville Ford Plant removed a significant revenue base and spelled the need for a substantial retooling of the local economy. 
As the regional and national economy rebounds, the city seeks to create an in-town, arts identity that will attract air travelers, local visitors and as importantly, bolster consumer offerings for Hapeville residents. The arts district overlay will become a significant element of an economic development strategy that will capitalize on Hapeville's airport location, sense of place, walkability and small town charm. 
An important aspect of that development strategy is the assignment of property rights not available to owners outside the arts district overlay. This reflects an emphasis on compact development supported by such public investment as streetscapes, public parking, public art, wayfinding signs, kiosks, film festivals and community events. The flexibility of building and site design and planned public investment are intended to foster an arts district that will establish downtown Hapeville as a regional destination for the arts and for community celebrations, dining and shopping.

(Ord. No. 2015-13 , § 1, 7-7-2015) 
Sec. 93-28-3. - Purpose. 
The purpose of the arts district overlay is to facilitate creation of an arts destination, sustain established arts and cultural uses and promote new arts and cultural uses. The arts district overlay seeks integration of the arts into the fabric of the community and is conceived as the location of art galleries and art studios forming the core of an arts district. A complementary mix of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues will support these uses. These elements are expected to generate interest in downtown Hapeville and attract arts and cultural events. 
The arts district overlay features an expanded range of permitted uses focused on the arts while retaining all property rights established by the underlying zoning. The arts district overlay encourages adaptive reuse of historic buildings and new construction technologies, affording owners expanded development options. These measures will enhance the market attractiveness of the arts district. 
Arts venues, community festivals, expanded arts uses and pedestrian character are expected to promote an arts district. Planned investment in public art, lighting, sidewalks and off-street parking will leverage private investment and enhance public safety. This combination of public and private investment is expected to advance Hapeville's position in regional leadership in the arts and stimulate broad economic revitalization. Importantly, the arts district overlay features walkable distances from nearby neighborhoods to small-scale establishments and live entertainment venues accommodated by the arts district overlay and compatible with the neighborhood character. 
(Ord. No. 2015-13 , § 1, 7-7-2015) 
Sec. 93-28-4. - Applicability. 
Unless expressly modified by regulations in this article establishing the arts district overlay, the regulations governing the use of land and structures shall be as set forth in the underlying zoning districts and as regulated by other provisions of this Code. The architectural design standards shall control development in the arts district overlay unless an alternate provision is adopted in the arts district overlay. Where a conflict with other City Code and ordinance provisions exists, the more permissive standard shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 2015-13 , § 1, 7-7-2015) 
Sec. 93-28-5. - Geography. 
Generally, the arts district overlay radiates from downtown Hapeville running along North Central and South Central Avenues, Dogwood Drive, the two-lane segment of Virginia Avenue (i.e. from South Central Avenue to Doug Davis Drive) and North and South Fulton Avenues. The District is more specifically identified in Exhibit A entitled "Hapeville Arts District Overlay Zone." 
(Ord. No. 2015-13 , § 1, 7-7-2015) 
Editor's note— Exhibit A as referenced in this section is not set out at length in this Code, but may be found in the offices of the city. 
Sec. 93-28-6. - Scale. 
Downtown Hapeville is the focus of the arts district overlay. Hapeville was established at a time when walking was the primary means of travel, and the downtown is characterized by a pedestrian scale. This scale is preserved by height limits inherent in the development intensity assigned to the downtown on Hapeville's future development map and development standards of the arts district overlay. A sense of place will be maintained by adherence to these height limits. Preservation of pedestrian scale is important as arts districts are typically designed to encourage walking to a variety of venues.

The city further agrees that if the amount of state grant funds which it is entitled to receive in a calendar year is less than its annual payment to the state agency, as may be determined by the state agency, then the city shall deposit in escrow, when so notified in writing by the state agency and in accordance with its rules and regulations, an amount which, when added to the city, state grant funds would total an amount sufficient to meet its obligations of reporting and remitting collections to the state agency.

Appendix B - CITY OF HAPEVILLE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK[1] 
ISSUE DATE: 11-1-1994 
INTRODUCTION 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Pursuant to provisions of Ord. No. 94-27, adopted November 11, 1994, former App. B, Personnel Rules and Regulations, has been stricken and a new App. B pertaining to similar subject matter has been set out in lieu thereof. 

§ 080. - Positions covered. 
These rules and regulations shall cover all city employees. Elected officials, appointed officers, members of boards, commissions and committees, and consultants are not covered by, and their conduct shall not be governed or regulated by, these rules. 
§ 081. - Administration. 
The mayor and council shall appoint a personnel director to administer these rules and regulations. 
The phrase "appointing authority" shall refer to the mayor and council or to their designee, usually a department head. 
EMPLOYMENT 
§ 101. - Nature of employment. 
Except as provided below, employment with the city is voluntarily entered into, and the employee is free to resign at will at any time, with or without cause. Similarly, the city may terminate the employment relationship at will at any time, with or without cause and without review. 
However, regular full-time employees who are dismissed for cause are entitled to the benefits of § 801 et seq. Except for financial, nonperformance-related reasons, regular full-time employees may only be dismissed for cause. 
Policies set forth in this handbook are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations of any kind or a contract of employment between the city and any of its employees. The provisions of the handbook have been developed at the discretion of the mayor and council and may be amended or canceled at any time, at the city's sole discretion. 
These provisions supersede all existing policies and practices and may not be amended or added to without the express written approval of the mayor and council. No promise, representation, practice, action, inaction or comment by any city employee, officer, elected official or agent shall work to amend the provisions of these rules. 
§ 102. - Employee relations. 
The city believes that the work conditions, wages, and benefits it offers to its employees are competitive with those offered by other employers in this area. If employees have concerns about work conditions or compensation, they are encouraged to voice these concerns openly and directly to their supervisors. 
Our experience has shown that when employees deal openly and directly with supervisors, the work environment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes can be positive. We believe that the city tries to demonstrate its commitment to employees by responding effectively to employee concerns. 
To protect and maintain direct employer/employee communications, we will resist organization, within applicable legal limits, and protect the right of employees to speak for themselves. 
§ 103. - Equal employment opportunity. 
In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at the city will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities. Except where required or permitted by law, employment practices will not be influenced or affected by an applicant's or employee's race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or any other characteristic protected by law. 
The city will make reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with known disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue hardship. This policy governs all aspects of employment, including selection, job assignment, compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training. 
Any employees with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination in the workplace are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their immediate supervisor or the personnel director. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal. Anyone engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
§ 104. - Hiring of relatives. 
The employment of relatives in the same department of any organization may cause serious conflicts and problems with favoritism and employee morale. In addition to claims of partiality in treatment at work, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be carried into day-to-day working relationships. 
Relatives of elected or appointed officials or of persons currently employed by the city may be hired only if they will not be working in the same department, will not be directly supervising a relative, and will not occupy a position in the same line of authority within the organization. This policy applies to any relative, higher or lower in the organization, who has the authority to [review] employment decisions. City employees cannot be transferred into such a reporting relationship. 
If the relative relationship is established after employment, the individuals concerned will decide who is to be transferred. A transfer is contingent upon a substantially similar position being available. If that decision is not made within thirty (30) calendar days, management will decide based upon the needs of the organization which employee is transferred and where if a substantially similar position is available to accommodate a transfer. If there is no substantially similar position, the employee to be transferred may be released from duty. 
In cases where a conflict or the potential for conflict arises, even if there is no supervisory relationship involved, the parties may be separated by reassignment or terminated from employment based upon the needs of the organization. If no substantially similar position is available and transfer is required, the employee to be transferred may be released from duty. 
For the purposes of this policy, relatives are deemed to include spouses, parents, children, brothers, sisters, brothers and sisters-in-law, fathers and mothers-in-law, nieces and nephews, stepparents, stepbrothers, nieces and nephews, stepparents, stepbrothers, stepsisters, and stepchildren. 
(Ord. No. 2000-20, § 1, 8-1-2000) 
§ 105. - Employee medical examinations. 
To help ensure that employees are able to perform their duties safely, medical examinations may be required. 
After an offer has been made to an applicant entering a designated job category, a medical examination may be performed at the city's expense by a health professional of the city's choice. The offer of employment and assignment to duties is contingent upon satisfactory completion of the exam. 
Information on an employee's medical condition or history will be kept separate from other employee information and maintained confidentially. 
§ 106. - Immigration law compliance. 
The city is committed to employing only United States citizens and aliens who are authorized to work in the United States and does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of citizenship or national origin. 
In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility. Former employees who are rehired must also complete the form if they have not completed an I-9 with the city within the past three (3) years, or if their previous I-9 is no longer retained or valid. 
Employees with questions on immigration law issues are encouraged to contact the personnel director. Employees may raise questions or complaints about immigration law compliance without fear of reprisal. 
§ 107. - Conflicts of interest. 
Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. This policy establishes only the framework within which the city wishes the business to operate. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide general direction so that employees can seek further clarification on issues related to the subject of acceptable standards of operation. 
An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of the city's business dealings. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood or marriage, or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage. 
No "presumption of guilt" is created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms. However, if an employee has any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that he or she discloses to an officer of the city as soon as possible the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties. 
Personal gain may result not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant ownership in a firm with which the city does business but also when an employee or relative receives any kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of any transaction or business dealings involving the city. 
The materials, products, designs, plans, ideas, and data of the city are the property of the city and should never be given to an outside firm or individual except through normal channels and with appropriate authorization. Any improper transfer of material or disclosure of information, even though it is not apparent that an employee has personally gained by such action, is unacceptable conduct. Any employee who participates in such a practice will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment. 
An employee shall not accept gifts, gratuities or loans from organizations, business concerns, or individuals with whom he has official relationships on business of the city government. These limitations are not intended to prohibit the acceptance of any articles, which are distributed free of charge to the general public, traditional holiday gifts of a nominal value nor public or private awards for meritorious service. 
§ 108. - Outside employment. 
Employees may hold outside jobs as long as they meet the performance standards of their job with the city. Employees should consider the impact that outside employment may have on their health and physical endurance. All employees will be judged by the same performance standards and will be subject to city scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements. 
If the city determines that an employee's outside work interferes with performance or the ability to meet the requirements of the city as they are modified from time to time, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside employment if he or she wishes to remain with the city. 
Outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest is prohibited. Employees may not receive any income or material gain from individuals outside the city for materials produced or services rendered while performing their jobs. 
Department heads may, at their discretion, require preapproval of outside employment. 
§ 109. - Nondisclosure. 
While most of the information in city hall may be public records, it is imperative that employees follow proper procedures for the release of such information. The protection of city records and information is vital to the interests of the city. Such information includes, but is not limited to, the following examples: 
Personnel files 
Public records 
Individual compensation data 
Customer lists 
Financial information 
Labor relations strategies 
Pending projects and proposals 
All employees may be required to sign a nondisclosure agreement as a condition of employment. Any employee who discloses information, without proper authorization or following established city procedures, will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment and legal action, even if he or she does not actually benefit from the disclosed information or if the information may be legally available through proper channels. 
§ 110. - Employment opportunities. 
The recruitment, selection, appointment and promotion of employees shall be conducted in such a manner as to promote equal employment opportunity for all persons without regard to race, age, color, creed, sex, national origin, or political affiliation. 
§ 111. - Vacant positions. 
Department heads shall be responsible for notifying the personnel director of vacant, or soon to be vacant, authorized positions in their department. The notification shall include the class title and salary range. As far as practical, vacancies may be filled by promotion of employees of the city. Notice of vacancies is routinely announced to city employees; a vacancy announcement should be posted for at least three (3) workdays in a specified location. 
§ 112. - Recruitment for vacant positions. 
All full-time vacancies should be publicized by the personnel director, by posting announcements and by other means as necessary to ensure obtaining well-qualified candidates for the positions. The announcement should specify the title and salary range of the vacant position, any minimum qualification requirements, manner of making application, the final date on which applications shall be received, and other pertinent information. Every reasonable effort shall be made to publicize vacancies, so that all interested persons are informed and qualified persons are attracted to compete. 
§ 113. - Application forms. 
Applications shall be made on the city application forms. Such forms shall include information covering training, experience and other pertinent factors. All applications shall be signed by the person applying. 
§ 114. - Disqualification. 
Applicants may be removed from further consideration by the personnel director if the applicant: 
(1)  Does not meet the minimum qualifications established for the position; 
(2)  Has a disability for which reasonable accommodation cannot be made that would prevent satisfactory performance of the duties of the position; 
(3)  Has made false statements of material fact, or practiced deception in his application; 
(4)  Is addicted to the habitual use of drugs or intoxicating liquors; 
(5)  Has an unsatisfactory employment record of such a nature as to demonstrate unsuitability for employment; 
(6)  Has been convicted of infamous, criminal or notoriously disgraceful conduct; or 
(7)  Has failed to submit or properly complete an application within the prescribed time limit. 
§ 115. - Selection and appointment. 
The personnel director shall review all applications for employment to determine whether the applicant meets the established standards for employment. Such information may be required as is necessary to make such determination. When appropriate, examinations may be used which may be written or oral or a combination of these. Such tests should be practical in character and should relate to the duties and responsibilities of the position for which the applicant is being examined. 
Within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of a vacant position, the personnel director, using the methods cited above, shall provide the appointing authority with a list of certified eligibles. 
The appointing authority shall continue the selection process from this list. The appointing authority shall conduct its selection process in an unbiased fashion, giving due consideration to the totality of circumstances, and in all cases attempt to employ the most qualified candidate. 
The appointing authority shall report its preferences to the relevant department chairman, who shall concur with the appointment prior to the extension of any offer of employment. 
§ 116. - Emergency appointment. 
When an emergency involving the serious impairment of the public business makes it impossible to fill a vacant position by normal procedure, the department head, with the approval of the personnel director, may appoint any qualified person to such position on a temporary basis to prevent stoppage of public business or loss, or serious inconvenience to the public. Such an appointment shall be for a period not to exceed thirty-one (31) days, during which time the normal selection procedures would be followed to fill the position permanently. 
EMPLOYMENT STATUS AND RECORDS 
§ 201. - Employment categories. 
It is the intent of the city to clarify the definitions of employment classifications so that employees understand their employment status and benefit eligibility. These classifications do not guarantee employment for any specified period of time. Accordingly, except as otherwise specified herein, the right to terminate the employment relationship at will at any time is retained by both the employee and city. 
Each employee is designated as either nonexempt or exempt from federal and state wage and hour laws. Nonexempt employees are entitled to overtime pay under the specific provisions of federal and state laws. Exempt employees are excluded from specific provisions of federal and state wage and hour laws. 
In addition to the above categories, each employee will belong to one other employment category: 
Department heads are the city administrator, the director of public services, the director of public safety, the chief of police, the chief of the fire department, the director of buildings and grounds, and director of recreation. Generally, they are eligible for the city's benefit package, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program. Employees in this category are not regular full-time employees, as that term is defined herein. This definition shall apply only to these rules and shall not affect or control actual administrative responsibility or authority. Nothing herein requires the city to fund or fill any of these positions. Department heads are not eligible for personnel board appeals of employment decisions and are at-will employees who may be terminated with or without cause by a majority vote of the mayor and council. 
Regular full-time employees are those who are not in a temporary or probationary status and who are regularly scheduled to work the city's full-time schedule. Generally, they are eligible for the city's benefit package, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program. In addition, if they are dismissed for cause, they are entitled to appeal rights as provided in § 801 and the following sections. 
Part-time employees are those who are not assigned to a temporary or probationary status and who are scheduled to work less than thirty (30) hours per week. While they do receive all legally mandated benefits (such as Social Security and workers' compensation insurance), they are ineligible for all of the city's other benefit programs. 
Probationary employees are those whose performance is being evaluated to determine whether further employment in a specific position or with the city is appropriate. Employees who satisfactorily complete the probationary period will be notified of their new employment classification. 
Temporary employees are those who are hired as interim replacements, to temporarily supplement the workforce, or to assist in the completion of a specific project. Employment assignments in this category are of limited duration. Employment beyond any initially stated period does not in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees retain that status unless and until notified in writing of a change. While temporary employees receive all legally mandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security), they are ineligible for all of the city's other benefit programs. 
Casual employees are those who have established an employment relationship with the city but who are assigned to work on an intermittent and/or unpredictable basis. While they receive all legally mandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security), they are ineligible for all of the city's other benefit programs. 
(Ord. No. 2000-09, § 1, 3-7-2000) 
§ 202. - Access to personnel files. 
The city maintains a personnel file on each employee. The personnel file includes such information as the employee's job application, resume, records of training, documentation of performance appraisals and salary increases, and other employment records. 
Personnel files are the property of the city, and access to the information they contain is restricted. Generally, only supervisors and management personnel of the city who have a legitimate reason to review information in a file are allowed to do so. However, such records must be disclosed to interested parties under Georgia Law upon proper request. 
Employees who wish to review their own file should contact the personnel director. With reasonable advance notice, employees may review their own personnel files in the city's offices and in the presence of an individual appointed by the city to maintain the files. You will have no right to remove any item from your file. 
§ 203. - Employment reference checks. 
To ensure that individuals who join the city are well qualified and have a strong potential to be productive and successful, it is the policy of the city to check the employment references of all applicants. The personnel director will respond in writing only to those reference check inquiries that are submitted in writing. Responses to such inquiries will confirm only dates of employment, wage rates, and position(s) held. No employment data will be released without a written authorization and release signed by the individual who is the subject of the inquiry. 
§ 204. - Personnel data changes. 
It is the responsibility of each employee to promptly notify the city of any changes in personnel data. Personal mailing addresses, telephone numbers, number and names of dependents, individuals to be contacted in the event of an emergency, educational accomplishments, and other such status reports should be accurate and current at all times. All official notices given by the city shall be sent to this address, and failure to keep the city advised of current address may result in notices being sent to the wrong address. 
§ 205. - Probationary period. 
The probationary period is intended to give new employees the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and to determine whether the new position meets their expectations. The city uses this period to evaluate employee capabilities, work habits, and overall performance. Except as otherwise provided herein, either the employee or the city may end the employment relationship at will at any time during or after the probationary period, with or without cause or advance notice. 
All new and rehired employees work on a probationary basis for the first one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after their date of hire. Employees who are promoted or transferred within the city must complete a second probationary period of the same length with each reassignment to a new position. Any significant absence will automatically extend a probationary period by the length of the absence. If the city determines that the designated probationary period does not allow sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate the employee's performance, the probationary period may be extended for a specified period, upon recommendation by the department head and concurrence by the personnel director. 
In cases of promotions or transfers within the city, an employee who, in the sole judgment of management, is not successful in the new position can be removed from that position at any time during the second probationary period. If this occurs, the employee may be allowed to return to his or her former job or to a comparable job for which the employee is qualified, depending on the availability of such positions and the city's needs. 
Upon satisfactory completion of the initial probationary period, employees shall be classified in one of the other employment classifications. 
During the initial probationary period, new employees are eligible for those benefits that are required by law, such as workers' compensation insurance and social security. After completion of probation, they may also be eligible for other city-provided benefits, subject to the terms and conditions of each benefits program. Employees should read the information for each specific benefits program for the details on eligibility requirements. 
Benefits eligibility are not changed during the probationary period that results from a promotion or transfer within the city. 
§ 206. - Employment applications. 
The city relies upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment application, as well as the accuracy of other data presented throughout the hiring process and employment. Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this information or data may result in the city's exclusion of the individual from further consideration for employment or, if the person has been hired, termination of employment. 
§ 207. - Performance evaluation. 
Supervisors and employees are strongly encouraged to discuss job performance and goals on an informal, day-to-day basis. Formal performance evaluations should be conducted at the end of an employee's initial period in any new position. This period, known as the probationary period, allows the supervisor and the employee to discuss the job responsibilities, standards, and performance requirements of the new position. Additional formal performance reviews are conducted to provide both supervisors and employees the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct weaknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for meeting goals. 
Merit-based pay adjustments may be periodically awarded by the city to recognize truly superior employee performance. The decision to award such an adjustment is dependent upon numerous factors, including the information documented by the performance review process. 
§ 208. - Classification plan; definitions. 
The classification plan is the systematic grouping of positions into appropriate classes: 
(1)  A position is a group of currently assigned duties and responsibilities requiring the full-time or part-time employment of one (1) person. A position may be occupied or vacant. 
(2)  A class is a group of positions (or one (1) position) that: 
a.  Has similar duties and responsibilities; 
b.  Requires like qualifications; and 
c.  Can be equitably compensated by the same range of pay. 
(3)  The class title is the official designation or name of the class, and it shall be used on all personnel records and transactions. 
§ 209. - Use of class specifications. 
Specifications should be interpreted in their entirety and in relation to others in the classification plan. Particular phrases or examples should not be isolated and treated as a full definition of class. Specifications are descriptive and explanatory of the kind of work performed and not necessarily inclusive of all duties performed. 
§ 210. - Maintenance of classification plan. 
The personnel director, working with the mayor and council, shall maintain the classification plan, so that it will reflect the duties performed by each employee in the classified service. He should periodically review the entire classification plan and recommend appropriate changes in allocations or in the classification plan. 
§ 211. - Allocation of positions. 
When a new position is established, or duties of an existing position change, the department head involved shall submit in writing a position description stating the duties and responsibilities of the position. The personnel director shall investigate the actual or proposed duties and recommend to the mayor and council the appropriate class allocation or the establishment of a new class. The mayor and council shall approve or change such recommendations and allocate the position to a class. 
§ 212. - Classification plan in effect. 
The classification plan shall be considered a part of this section and shall have the same force and effect as these personnel rules and regulations. The plan is directory only and does not constitute a contract or promise to any employee to pay any increases scheduled therein. A copy of the classification plan shall be maintained by the personnel director. 
§ 213. - Pay plan. 
The pay plan includes the adopted salary schedule, and the schedule of salary ranges, consisting of rates of pay for all classes of positions included in the classification plan. The plan is directory only and does not constitute a contract or promise to pay any employee any increase scheduled therein. The pay plan shall be considered a part of this section and shall have the same force and effect as these rules. 
Editor's note— The pay plan referenced in these sections is not set out at length herein, but is on file and available for inspection in the office of the personnel director. 
§ 214. - Maintenance of the pay plan. 
The pay plan is intended to provide fair compensation for all classes in the classification plan, considering range of pay for other classes, rates of pay for comparable services in private and public employment in the area, cost of living data, other benefits received by employees, the city's financial condition and policy, and other factors. The personnel director shall, when directed by the mayor and council, make or cause to be made comparative studies of all factors affecting the level of salary ranges. Based on conclusions reached through such studies, the personnel director should recommend to the mayor and council changes in salary ranges, as appropriate. 
Note— See the editor's note following § 213. 
§ 215. - Entrance salary. 
The minimum rate established for the class is the normal hiring rate. An employee seeking a voluntary transfer from one position to another, which second position is of a lower class, shall be paid according to the scale of the class of the new position, as modified by the step increases received by virtue of prior uninterrupted service. Appointments, under special conditions and subject to the prior approval of the mayor and council, may be made above the minimum rate when such action is determined to be necessary in the best interest of the city. Approval will be based on such conditions as shortage of qualified applicants available at the minimum step; qualifications of the applicant being in excess of the requirements for the class. 
§ 216. - Promotion. 
An employee who is promoted should have his salary raised according to years of service, to the lowest step of the range for the class of his new position which will effect an increase in his salary at least as great as a full step in his previous salary range. 
§ 217. - Demotion. 
When an employee is demoted, he shall be paid at a rate which is within the range of the lower position. The rate of pay shall be set by the appointing authority, taking into consideration the circumstances surrounding the reasons for the demotion, as well as the employee's length of service, and service record with the city. 
§ 218. - Salary reviews. 
When funds have been specifically allocated in the budget for such purposes, salary increases may be granted to specific classes of employees, upon the recommendation of the personnel director and approval of the mayor and council. 
§ 219. - Pay plan in force. 
The pay plan shall be considered a part of this section and have the same force and effect as these personnel rules and regulations. 
Note— See the editor's note following § 213. 
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAM 
§ 301. - Employee benefits. 
Eligible employees at the city are provided a wide range of benefits. Many of the programs (such as social security, workers' compensation, and unemployment insurance) cover all employees in the manner prescribed by law. 
Benefits eligibility is dependent upon a variety of factors, including employee classification. Your supervisor can identify the programs for which you are eligible. Details of many of these programs can be found elsewhere in the employee handbook. 
The following benefit programs may be available to eligible employees: 
Bereavement leave 
Credit union 
Holiday pay 
Jury duty leave 
Medical insurance 
Military leave 
Pension plan 
Sick leave benefits (shortterm disability) 
Vacation benefits 
Voting time off 
Witness duty leave 
Some benefit programs require contributions from the employee, but most are fully paid by the city. The city reserves the right to expand or withdraw available benefits at any time. 
§ 302. - Vacation benefits. 
Vacation time off with pay is available to eligible employees to provide opportunities for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. Employees in the following employment classifications are eligible to earn and use vacation time as described in this policy: 
Department heads 
Regular full-time employees 
The amount of paid vacation time employees receive each year increases with the length of their employment as shown in the following schedule: 
VACATION EARNING SCHEDULE 

 
(The column labeled "Maximum Earned Days" is illustrative only, and accrual calculation shall be determined biweekly. The column labeled "Vacation Hours Biweekly" shall not apply to the fire department.) 
For the purposes of this section, for fire department employees, a "week" shall equal one (1) seven-day period, usually running from Monday to Monday. 
The length of eligible service is calculated on the basis of a "benefit year." This is the twelve-month period that begins when the employee starts to earn vacation time. An employee's benefit year may be extended for any significant leave of absence except military leave of absence. Military leave has no effect on this calculation. (See individual leave of absence policies for more information.) Fire Department employees accrue time proportional to their length of service. 
Once employees enter an eligible employment classification, they begin to earn paid vacation time according to the schedule. However, before vacation time can first be used, a waiting period of three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days must be completed. After that time, employees can request use of earned vacation time including that accrued during the waiting period. Only ten (10) days are available to employees during the second year. Vacation leave may only be used after accrual, and no employee shall utilize annual leave that has not yet been earned. 
Except for the fire department, paid vacation time can be used in minimum increments of four (4) hours. Fire department employees may take vacation only in one-week increments, except for extraordinary circumstances as approved by the chief. To take vacation, employees should request advance approval from their immediate supervisors. Requests will be reviewed by department heads based on a number of factors, including business needs, seniority, and staffing requirements. 
Vacation time off is paid at the employee's base pay rate at the time of vacation. It does not include overtime or any special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. 
As stated above, employees are encouraged to use available paid vacation time for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. In the event that available vacation is not used by the end of the benefit year, employees may carry unused time forward to the next benefit year. If the total amount of unused vacation time reaches a "cap" equal to two (2) times the annual vacation amount of the employee in question, further accrual will stop. When the employee uses paid vacation time and brings the available amount below the cap, thereafter vacation accrual will begin again. 
Upon termination of employment, employees will be paid for accrued unused vacation time that has been earned through the last day of work. 
No employee shall be allowed to work with the city during vacation leave and receive additional pay therefor. 
This leave shall only be earned while an employee is in service. Except for sick leave and vacation leave, employees utilizing other leave benefits shall not accrue vacation leave during the duration of the leave. 
§ 303. - Major medical insurance. 
The city currently provides major medical insurance to eligible employees. 
Eligible employees classification(s): 
Department heads 
Regular full-time employees 
The terms and conditions of the currently available policy can be reviewed with the personnel director. 
The city reserves the right, at any time, to change, modify or eliminate any coverage, terms, conditions or other items related to this benefit and no contractual right shall accrue to any employee for the continuation of any coverage or level of coverage, deductible amount, copay amount or type of coverage, as the city reserves the right to amend or modify such at its discretion. 
§ 304. - Holidays. 
(a)  The city will grant holiday time off to all employees on the holidays listed below: 
(1)  New Year's Day (January 1); 
(2)  Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (January 15);

(Ord. No. 97-02, 6-3-1997; Ord. No. 2000-07, § 1, 3-7-2000) 
§ 305. - Workers' compensation insurance. 
The city provides a workers' compensation insurance program. This program covers injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that requires medical, surgical, or hospital treatment, pursuant to the requirements of Georgia Law. Subject to applicable legal requirements, workers' compensation insurance provides benefits after a short waiting period or, if the employee is hospitalized, immediately. 
Employees may utilize, at the employee's discretion, any accrued annual, sick, or personal leave during any waiting period. The employee's choice must be given to the personnel director, in writing. Absence of election by the employee shall be assumed to mean that the employee does not wish to utilize accrued leave. 
Employees who sustain work-related injuries or illnesses must inform their supervisor immediately. No matter how minor an on-the-job injury may appear, it is important that it be reported immediately. Failure to promptly report any injury will not only jeopardize coverage, but will, in most instances, result in disciplinary action. This will enable an eligible employee to qualify for coverage as quickly as possible. 
Neither the city nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers' compensation benefits for injuries that occur during an employee's voluntary participation in any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by the city. 
§ 306. - Sick leave benefits. 
The city provides paid sick leave benefits to all eligible employees for periods of temporary absence due to illnesses or injuries resulting from causes beyond the employee's control; or for medical or dental examinations or treatments for which arrangements cannot be made outside working hours. 
Eligible employee classification(s): 
Department heads 
Regular full-time employees 
Eligible employees may accrue sick leave benefits at the rate of up to ninety-six (96) hours per year (four (4) hours for every biweekly period of service). For fire department employees, twelve (12) twenty-four-hour "days," accrued at one-half (0.5) twenty-four-hour days per biweekly period of service, may be earned. Sick leave benefits are calculated on the basis of a "benefit year," the twelve-month period that begins when the employee starts to earn sick leave benefits. 
Except as provided below, employees may accumulate sick leave up to a maximum of one thousand forty (1,040) hours, after reaching that amount, no sick leave shall accrue until after the total account balance shall have been reduced to less than one thousand forty (1,040) hours. 
No sick leave shall accrue during any biweekly period in which the employee is absent the entire period and utilizing sick leave benefits. 
Paid sick leave can be used in minimum increments of one (1) hour. Eligible employees may use sick leave benefits for an absence due to their own illness or injury or that of a family member who resides in the employee's household provided that such illness or injury reasonably obligates the employee to be elsewhere. 
Employees who are unable to report to work due to illness or injury should notify their direct supervisor before the scheduled start of their workday if possible. Failure to do so may be cause for denial of sick leave with pay for that day and for each subsequent day that prior notification has not been given. Special consideration will be given for emergency situations. 
The direct supervisor must also be contacted on each additional day of absence. Supervisors may, under proper circumstances, relieve employees from the obligation to make such contact for extended sicknesses. 
If an employee is absent for two (2) or more consecutive days due to illness or injury, a physician's statement must be provided verifying the disability and its beginning and expected ending dates. Physician statements must also be provided for sick leave requests of any length if the employee has been notified that, due to frequent or habitual use of sick leave, such will be henceforth required. Such verification may be requested for other sick leave absences as well and may be required as a condition to receiving sick leave benefits. 
Before returning to work from a sick leave absence of thirty (30) calendar days or more, an employee must provide a physician's verification that he or she may safely return to work. 
Sick leave benefits will be calculated based on the employee's base pay rate at the time of absence and will not include any special forms of compensation, such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. 
Unused sick leave benefits will be allowed to accumulate as stated below. 
Sick leave benefits are intended solely to provide income protection in the event of illness or injury, and may not be used for any other absence. Misrepresentations about the use of this leave is a serious matter and will result in disciplinary action. 
Unused sick leave benefits will not be paid to employees while they are employed or upon termination of employment. 
Transitory rules: 
(1)  Any employee with unused sick leave at the end of his or her tenure with the city will be allowed one (1) of the following options: 
a.  Take early retirement equivalent to the amount of unused sick leave; or 
b.  Add unused sick leave to years of service for retirement computations; 
provided, however, all employees with an employment date of on or after January 3, 1990, may not choose option a. 
(2)  Eligible employees hired before September 1, 1994, shall be allowed an unlimited accrual of sick leave. 
During the time frame provided herein, all full-time employees shall be temporarily eligible for an incentive bonus procedure based on sick leave benefits used. This experimental incentive bonus shall terminate on November 30, 2001, unless the Mayor and Council of the City of Hapeville, Georgia, elect to continue the program. 
Eligible employees will receive an incentive bonus, for which they qualify, to be paid on the first or second work Friday in the month of December during each year the program is in place. 
Payments shall be made based on sick leave benefits used as follows: 

 
Eligible employees who have properly scheduled time off from work may use earned compensatory time or vacation time during a period of illness for which the employee is absent from work due to personal or family illness. 
(Ord. No. 2000-15, § 1, 5-2-2000) 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2000-15, § 1, adopted May 2, 2000, is an experimental incentive bonus program (sick leave) that will terminate on November 30, 2001, unless the mayor and council of the city elect to continue the program. 
§ 307. - Time off to vote. 
The city encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by participating in elections. Generally, employees are able to find time to vote either before or after their regular work schedule. If employees are unable to vote in an election during their nonworking hours, the city will grant up to two (2) hours of paid time off to vote. 
Employees who know that they will be required to remain on duty for the protection of health, life, or safety of the public during the entire time the polls are to be open should apply for an absentee ballot to avoid the need to miss work. Employees who can't make other arrangements should request time off to vote from their supervisor at least two (2) working days prior to the election day. Advance notice is required so that the necessary time off can be scheduled at the beginning or end of the work shift, whichever provides the least disruption to the normal work schedule. 
§ 308. - Bereavement leave. 
If an employee wishes to take time off due to the death of an immediate family member, the employee should notify his or her supervisor immediately. 
Up to three (3) consecutive calendar days of paid bereavement leave for each qualifying death will be provided to eligible employees in the following classifications: 
Department heads 
Regular full-time employees 
Bereavement pay is calculated based on the base pay rate at the time of absence and will not include any special forms of compensation, such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. 
Approval of bereavement leave will occur in the absence of unusual operating requirements. Any employee may, with the supervisor's approval, use any other available paid leave, except sick leave, for additional time off as necessary. 
The city defines "immediate family" as the employee's spouse, parent, child, sibling; the employee's spouse's parent, child, or sibling; the employee's child's spouse; grandparents or grandchildren. Special consideration will also be given to any other person whose association with the employee was similar to any of the above relationships. 
§ 309. - Jury duty. 
The city encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by serving jury duty when required. Any compensation received from the courts or a party during this period must be remitted to the city. 
Jury duty pay will be calculated on the employee's base pay rate times the number of hours the employee would otherwise have worked on the day of absence. Employee classifications that qualify for paid jury duty leave are: 
Department heads 
Regular full-time employees 
Employees must show the jury duty summons to their supervisor as soon as possible so that the supervisor may make arrangements to accommodate their absence. Of course, employees are expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits. 
Either the city or the employee may request an excuse from jury duty if, in the city's judgment, the employee's absence would create serious operational difficulties. 
The city will continue to provide health insurance benefits for the full term of the jury duty absence. Vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits, will continue to accrue during jury duty leave. 
§ 310. - Witness duty. 
The city encourages employees to appear in court for witness duty when subpoenaed to do so. 
If employees have been subpoenaed as witnesses by or on the behalf of the city or by any party in a criminal proceeding, they will receive regular paid time off for the entire period of witness duty. 
Otherwise, employees will be granted a maximum of sixteen (16) hours of paid time off per calendar year to appear in court as a witness. Any compensation received from the court or other party during this period must be remitted to the city. If under subpoena, employees will be paid at their base rate and are free to use any remaining paid leave benefits (e.g., vacation leave) to receive compensation for any period of witness duty absence that would otherwise be unpaid. 
The subpoena should be shown to the employee's supervisor immediately after it is received so that operating requirements can be adjusted, where necessary, to accommodate the employee's absence. 
The employee is expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits. This section shall not apply to certified employees of the police department who shall follow the rules of the police department. 
§ 311. - Benefits continuation (COBRA). 
The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) may give employees and their qualified beneficiaries the opportunity to continue health insurance coverage under the city's health plan when a "qualifying event" would normally result in the loss of eligibility. Some common qualifying events are resignation, termination of employment, or death of an employee; a reduction in an employee's hours or a leave of absence; an employee's divorce or legal separation; and a dependent child no longer meeting eligibility requirements. 
Under COBRA, the employee or beneficiary pre-pays the full cost of coverage at the city's group rates plus an administration fee. Failure to pre-pay premium amounts shall result in a loss of coverage and the city shall have no obligation to pay these amounts on the employee's behalf. 
The city provides each eligible employee with a written notice describing rights granted under COBRA when the employee becomes eligible for coverage under the city's health insurance plan. The notice contains important information about the employee's rights and obligations. 
§ 312. - Disability and retirement. 
An employee may be separated for disability when he cannot perform the required duties, or when continuance on the job is a danger to himself or others. 
Action may be initiated by the employee at his expense, or the city at its expense, but in all cases it must be supported by medical evidence acceptable to the personnel director and social security per Joint Municipal Employees Benefit System requirement. When an employee meets the conditions set forth in the Joint Municipal Employees Benefit System, he may retire and shall receive compensation due in accordance therewith. 
The mandatory retirement age for employees in the city is set at seventy (70). Employment may be extended beyond seventy (70), if recommended by the personnel director and approved by the mayor and council. Standards for a recommendation of extension shall be based on such things as: necessity, in order to accomplish recruitment or training of personnel to fill the vacancy and/or to maintain or increase operations productivity. Prior to reaching a decision to extend employment, a physical examination, at the city's expense, may be required. 
§ 313. - Participation in Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System—Terminated. 
(1)  Effective date of termination. The city's participation in the GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund shall terminate as of June 30, 2007, except as otherwise provided in subsection (11) below. 
(2)  Successor group annuity contract. Effective July 1, 2007, and except as otherwise provided in subsection (11) below, MassMutual Financial Group ("successor group annuity contract") shall assume from the GMEBS board of trustees fiduciary responsibility for investing plan assets and satisfying plan liabilities with respect to funds transferred pursuant to subsection (6) below. 
(3)  Restated plan. Effective July 1, 2007, and except as otherwise provided in subsection (11) below, the defined benefit retirement plan for employees of the City of Hapeville, as set forth in the GMEBS master plan, trust agreement, adoption agreement and addendum, as amended, shall be repealed and replaced with a new defined benefit plan for employees of the City of Hapeville ("restated plan"). Such plan will be established and maintained as a qualified defined benefit plan pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 401(a). On and after July 1, 2007, the rights and obligations of city employees and members of the governing authority with respect to retirement and death benefits shall be determined in accordance with the restated plan. On and after July 1, 2007, employees and former employees of the city, current and former members of the governing authority, and their beneficiaries, heirs, and assigns shall have no further right, title, or interest under the GMEBS master plan or the city's adoption agreement and addendum, provided that the vested retirement rights of plan participants existing as of the termination date will not be impaired under the restated plan. 
(4)  Termination of GMEBS' administrative responsibilities. On and after July 1, 2007 GMEBS and GMA shall have no further responsibility or obligation to administer the City's retirement plan, including but not limited to issuing retirement, death, or disability checks after July 1, 2007, direct deposit of benefit payments after said date, completing the annual actuarial valuation of the plan, processing applications for retirement or death benefits, preparing benefit estimates, and responding to participant and beneficiary inquiries concerning the plan. However, GMEBS will issue tax reports (1099's) no later than January 31, 2008, reflecting benefit payments made for the period January to June 30, 2007. GMEBS is authorized and directed to forward to the city and/or to the successor plan administrator designated by the city any records held by GMEBS that are specifically requested by the city or the plan administrator, provided that such records are reasonably necessary or useful in facilitating the transfer of administrative responsibilities and/or implementing administration of the successor plan. 
(5)  Valuation of assets. The value of the city's trust fund shall be determined as of June 30, 2007, based upon the value of the city's trust fund as reflected in the June 30, 2007, unaudited financial statements for the GMEBS retirement trust fund, subject to verification and reconciliation pursuant to the December 31, 2007, audit to be completed for the GMEBS retirement trust fund, as provided in subsection (8) below. 
(6)  Transfer of assets; successor plan documents. The GMEBS board of trustees is hereby authorized and directed to transfer any and all assets held in the city's trust fund to the successor group annuity contract designated by the city, as provided herein. However, in no event will the transfer be effected until a restated plan (including a 401(a)-qualified plan document) has been adopted and executed in accordance with section 3 and a copy of said restated plan has been furnished to GMEBS, together with an IRS determination letter or attorney opinion letter confirming that the restated plan meets the IRC 401(a) tax qualification requirements applicable to governmental plans. The city will furnish such documents, together with an executed copy of a termination ordinance acceptable to GMEBS, custodial bank routing information, and other information reasonably requested by GMEBS for purposes of facilitating the termination and transfer of assets, on or before May 16, 2007. Assuming receipt of said documents and information by May 16, 2007, GMEBS will notify the city on or before June 1, 2007, whether the documents and information supplied by the city are sufficient to permit transfer of assets. In the event GMEBS requests changes, as long as the city resubmits the documents with the changes on or before June 27, 2007, the remaining timeline herein shall remain in effect. If GMEBS determines that the documents and information supplied by the city are sufficient to permit transfer of assets, then GMEBS will notify its investment managers on or before June 29, 2007, to commence liquidation of assets as necessary to facilitate the transfer of assets on or after July 1, 2007. However, if the city does not provide the above-referenced documents and information to GMEBS by May 16, 2007, (or June 27, 2007, in the case of revised documents) or if GMEBS determines and notifies the city on or before June 29, 2007, that the documents and information supplied by the city are not sufficient to permit transfer of assets, then the June 30, 2007, effective date for termination and valuation of assets referred to in subsections (1) and (5) above will be deferred as provided in subsection (11) below. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (11) below, GMEBS will initially transfer to the successor group annuity contract after July 1, 2007 an amount equal to 85 percent of the value of the city's trust fund as reflected in the then-most recently completed unaudited monthly financial statement for the GMEBS retirement trust fund. Prior to completion of the initial transfer, GMEBS is authorized to deduct from the city's trust fund a $5,000.00 fee for services provided in effecting the termination of the city's participation in GMEBS and the transfer of assets to the successor group annuity contract. The city may pay the termination fee directly in lieu of said deduction, provided payment is made on or before the initial transfer date. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (11) below, after completion of the GMEBS retirement fund unaudited financial statement for June 30, 2007, GMEBS will make a second transfer to the successor group annuity contract in an amount equal to the remainder of the city's trust fund assets, if any (city trust fund balance as reflected in GMEBS June 30, 2007, unaudited financial statements, minus initial transfer amount, plus any interest accrued on and after July 1, 2007). If the value of the city's trust fund as reflected in the June 30, 2007, unaudited financial statements decreases from that reflected in the most recently completed unaudited monthly financial statement prior to June 30, 2007, used to determine the initial transfer amount such that the 85% initial transfer amount is more than the value of city's trust fund as of June 30, 2007, as reflected in the most recent unaudited financial statements for June 30, 2007, then GMEBS will be reimbursed and may deduct any overpayment from funds remaining in the city's trust fund. Any remaining overpayment amount shall be reimbursed by the city immediately after the city receives notice of the overpayment from GMEBS. If the remaining overpayment amount is not returned within 30 days, interest shall be payable on such amount at the then current GMEBS valuation interest rate. 
(7)  Interest. On and after July 1, 2007, any funds remaining in the city's trust fund shall not share in the gains or losses of the GMEBS retirement trust fund, notwithstanding any provision of the GMEBS master plan or trust agreement to the contrary. Any investment gains or losses that would otherwise be credited to or debited from the city's trust fund after July 1, 2007, shall not be taken into account. For the period July 1, 2007, through completion of the transfer of assets, any amount remaining in the city's trust fund shall earn interest at the same rate as the GMEBS active cash management account. Said interest shall be credited monthly as of July 31, 2007, and as of the last day of each month thereafter up until the date that the transfer of assets is completed. 
(8)  Audit reconciliation. If the audit of the GMEBS retirement trust fund for the year ending December 31, 2007, reflects that the value of the city's trust fund as of June 30, 2007, was understated in the June 30, 2007, unaudited financial statements by more than $1,000.00 and that due to such understatement the amount transferred to the successor group annuity contract is at least $1,000.00 less than the amount that should have been transferred, then GMEBS shall immediately return the difference to the successor group annuity contract in a lump sum with interest. Said interest shall be calculated at the same rate as the GMEBS active cash management account and credited monthly as of the last day of each month following June 30, 2007, up until the date of the return payment. In the event that the December 31, 2007, GMEBS retirement trust fund audit shows that the value of the city's trust fund as of June 30, 2007, was overstated in the June 30, 2007, unaudited financial statements by more than $1,000.00 and that due to such overstatement the amount transferred to the successor group annuity contract is at least $1,000.00 more than the amount that should have been transferred, then the city shall immediately return the difference to the GMEBS retirement trust fund in a lump sum with interest calculated and paid in the same manner as provided above. This provision applies in addition to and not in lieu of the provision for return of overpayment amounts under subsection (6) above. 
(9)  City's right to audit. GMEBS will provide the city with reasonable access to GMEBS retirement trust fund records for the purpose of: 1) auditing the value of the city's trust fund, as reflected in the GMEBS June 30, 2007, financial statement; and 2) auditing the accuracy of monthly allocation calculations for the period January 2007 until the date that the second transfer of assets is completed. Any such audit shall be performed at the city's expense by certified public accountants designated by the city. Review and copying of GMEBS records in connection with the audit shall be performed in the presence of the custodian of said records or the custodian's designee. The results of any audit performed by the city shall be considered by the GMEBS auditor in good faith and in accordance with applicable professional standards in performing the audit reconciliation referred to in subsection (8) above, but said results shall not be binding on GMEBS. 
(10)  Outstanding checks. No later than August 5, 2007, GMEBS will provide the city with a register of all outstanding checks as of July 31, 2007, which will include the names and last known addresses of retirees with outstanding checks, so that the city or the successor administrator can notify affected retirees that GMEBS checks will be voided if they are not cashed by August 31, 2007. GMEBS will stop payment on any outstanding checks remaining on August 31, 2007, and transfer to the successor group annuity contract immediately thereafter the amount of said outstanding checks. 
(11)  Deferral of termination-valuation date, transfer dates, and other corresponding due dates. If the plan documents and other information referred to in subsection (6) are not provided by the city to GMEBS by May 16, 2007, (or June 27, 2007, in the case of revised documents) or if GMEBS determines and notifies the city on or before June 29, 2007 that the documents and information supplied by the city pursuant to subsection (6) are not sufficient to permit transfer of assets, then the June 30, 2007, effective date for termination and valuation of assets referred to in subsections (1) and (5) above will be deferred until July 31, 2007, and all references to June 30, 2007, in this section will be considered changed to July 31, 2007, notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary. In such event, the July 1, 2007, initial transfer date referred to in subsection (6) will be deferred until on or after August 1, 2007, and all other references to July 1, 2007 in this section will be considered changed to August 1, 2007. All other corresponding action dates or due dates referred to in this section will be deferred by one month. If the termination date and other applicable due dates are deferred by one month by operation of this section, but the city does not furnish to GMEBS the documents and information referred to in this section by July 15, 2007, or if GMEBS notifies the city on or before July 25, 2007, that such documents or information are insufficient to permit transfer of assets, then the effective date of termination and valuation of assets will be deferred again until the last day of the month in which GMEBS reasonably determines and provides notice to the city that it has received all documents and information from the city necessary to permit the transfer of assets. In such case, the initial transfer date and other corresponding action dates or due dates will also be deferred accordingly, so that the time intervals between the deferred termination date and the deferred action or due dates will be the same as those reflected in this section. 
(12)  Termination of trust agreement; restated plan liability. Upon completion of the transfer of assets referred to in subsection (6), the GMEBS board of trustees shall have no further fiduciary responsibility for investment of the city's trust fund assets or payment of liabilities, except as provided in sections (7) and (8) above, and the city's participation under the GMEBS Trust Agreement shall be considered terminated. 
(13)  a.  [Severability.] It is hereby declared to be the intention of the mayor and council that all sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this section are or were, upon their enactment, believed by the mayor and council to be fully valid, enforceable and constitutional. 
b.  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the mayor and council that, to the greatest extent allowed by law, each and every section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this section is severable from every other section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this section. It is hereby further declared to be the intention of the mayor or council that, to the greatest extent allowed by law, no section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this section is mutually dependent upon any other section paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this section. 
c.  In the event that any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this section shall, for any reason whatsoever, be declared invalid, unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, it is the express intent of the mayor and council that such invalidity, unconstitutionality or unenforceability shall, to the greatest extent allowed by law, not render invalid, unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs or sections of the section and that, to the greatest extent allowed by law, all remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of the section shall remain valid, constitutional, enforceable, and of full force and effect. 
(14)  [Penalties.] Penalties, where applicable, provided for violations of this Ordinance are set out in section 1-1-8 of the Code of Ordinances, City of Hapeville, Georgia. 
(Ord. No. 2007-10, §§ 1—14; Ord. No. 2007-10-A, §§ 1—14, 7-17-2007) 
TIMEKEEPING; PAYROLL; SEPARATION 
§ 401. - Timekeeping. 
Accurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every nonexempt employee. Federal and state laws require the city to keep an accurate record of time worked in order to calculate employee pay and benefits. Time worked is all the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties. 
The city does not intend to indicate that dedication to your job is not appreciated. However, federal overtime laws mandate that overtime must be paid, thus having an impact on budget projections. As a consequence, it is important that you comply with these rules. 
Nonexempt employees should accurately record the time they begin and end their work, as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal period. They should also record the beginning and ending time of any split shift or departure from work for personal reasons. 
Overtime work must always be approved before it is performed. Failure to receive authorization to work overtime may result in disciplinary action. Overtime for certain situations may be preapproved by your supervisor. 
Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording time on another employee's time record may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
Except for police employees, who shall follow the instructions of the shift commander, nonexempt employees should not report to work prior to their scheduled starting time nor stay after their scheduled stop time without expressed, prior authorization from their supervisor. 
§ 402. - Paydays. 
All employees are paid weekly and biweekly, depending on employment status. 
In the event that a regularly scheduled payday falls on a day off (e.g., a weekend or holiday), employees will normally receive pay on the last day of work before the regularly scheduled payday. 
§ 403. - Employment termination. 
Termination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and many of the reasons for termination are routine. Below are examples of some of the most common circumstances under which employment is terminated: 
Discharge: Employment termination initiated by the city. 
Layoff: Involuntary employment termination initiated by the city for nondisciplinary reasons. 
Medical termination: Employment termination initiated by the employee or by the city when an employee is unable, for health reasons, to continue to work. 
Resignation: Employee termination initiated by an employee who chooses to leave the city voluntarily. 
Retirement: Voluntary retirement from active employment status initiated by the employee. 
The city will generally schedule pretermination interviews preceding or on the same day as employment termination. The interview will afford an opportunity for the employee and department head or other supervisor to discuss such issues as: reason for termination, if any; employee defenses or reasons for employee conduct; employee factors in mitigation; employee benefits; benefit conversion privileges; repayment of outstanding debts to the city; and/or return of city-owned property as may be relevant. Suggestions, complaints, and questions can also be voiced. Further, COBRA and the continuation of other benefits postseparation shall be discussed at a postseparation exit interview in accordance with § 711. 
(Ord. No. 2002-02, § 1, 2-5-2002) 
§ 404. - Severance pay. 
The city does not grant severance pay to employees whose employment is terminated. However, the city reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in its sole and absolute discretion. 
§ 405. - Pay advances. 
Neither pay advances nor extensions of credit on unearned wages can be provided to employees. If a regular payday falls during an employee's vacation, the employee's paycheck will be available upon his or her return from vacation. 
§ 406. - Administrative pay corrections. 
The city takes all reasonable steps to ensure that employees receive the correct amount of pay in each paycheck and that employees are paid promptly on the scheduled payday. 
In the unlikely event that there is an error in the amount of pay, the employee should promptly bring the discrepancy to the attention of the city so that corrections can be made as quickly as possible. 
Once underpayments are identified, they will be corrected as soon as possible, but usually no later than the next regular paycheck. 
Overpayments will also normally be corrected in the next regular paycheck unless this presents a burden to the employee (where there is a substantial amount owed). In that case, the city will attempt to arrange a schedule of repayments with the employee to minimize the inconvenience to all involved. 
§ 407. - Pay deductions and setoffs. 
The law requires that the city make certain deductions from every employee's compensation. Among these are applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. 
Pay setoffs are pay deductions taken by the city, usually to help pay off a debt or obligation to the city or others. 
If you have questions concerning why deductions were made from your pay check or how they were calculated, your supervisor can assist in having your questions answered. 
WORK CONDITIONS AND HOURS 
§ 501. - Safety. 
To provide a safe and healthful work environment for employees, customers, and visitors, the city has established a workplace safety program. This program is a top priority for the city. The personnel director has responsibility for implementing, administering, monitoring, and evaluating the safety program. Its success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all. 
The city provides information to employees about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal communication channels such as supervisor-employee meetings, bulletin board postings, memos, or other written communications. 
Employees and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training. The training covers potential safety and health hazards and safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or minimize hazards. 
Some of the best safety improvement ideas come from employees. Those with ideas, concerns, or suggestions for improved safety in the workplace are encouraged to raise them with their supervisor, or with another supervisor or manager, or bring them to the attention of the personnel director. Reports and concerns about workplace safety issues may be made anonymously if the employee wishes. All reports can be made without fear of reprisal. 
Each employee is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities. Employees must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor. Employees who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
In the case of accidents that result in injury, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear, employees must immediately notify the personnel director or the appropriate supervisor. Such reports are necessary to comply with laws and initiate insurance and workers' compensation benefits procedures. 
§ 502. - Work schedules. 
Work schedules for employees vary throughout our organization. Supervisors will advise employees of their individual work schedules. Staffing needs and operational demands may necessitate variations in starting and ending times, as well as variations in the total hours that may be scheduled each day and week. 
§ 503. - Use of phone and mail systems. 
Personal use of telephones for outgoing calls, including local calls, should be kept to an absolute minimum, but in no event more than three minutes per call. No employee may incur toll or other charges on city phones for personal business. Employees shall be required to reimburse the city for any charges resulting from their personal use of the telephone. 
The mail system is reserved for business purposes only. Employees should refrain from sending or receiving personal mail at the workplace. 
To ensure effective telephone communications, employees should always use the approved greeting and speak in a courteous and professional manner. Please confirm information received from the caller, and hang up only after the caller has done so. 
§ 504. - Rest and meal periods. 
All full-time employees except police, fire and emergency service employees are provided with one (1) meal period each workday. Supervisors will schedule meal periods to accommodate operating requirements. Employees will be relieved of all active responsibilities and restrictions during meal periods and will not be compensated for that time. 
§ 505. - Overtime. 
When operating requirements or other needs cannot be met during regular working hours, employees may be scheduled to work overtime hours. When possible, advance notification of these mandatory assignments will be provided. All overtime work must receive the supervisor's prior authorization. Department heads may preapprove situations in which overtime may be required. Overtime assignments will be distributed as equitably as practical to all employees qualified to perform the required work. 
Overtime compensation is paid to all nonexempt employees in accordance with federal and state wage and hour restrictions. As required by law, overtime pay is based on actual hours worked. Time off on sick leave, vacation leave, or any leave of absence will not be considered hours worked for purposes of performing overtime calculations. 
Failure to work scheduled overtime or overtime worked without prior authorization from the supervisor may result in disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment. 
§ 506. - Use of equipment and vehicles. 
Equipment and vehicles essential in accomplishing job duties are expensive and may be difficult to replace. When using property, employees are expected to exercise care, perform required maintenance, and follow all operating instructions, safety standards, and guidelines. 
Please notify the supervisor if any equipment, machines, tools, or vehicles appear to be damaged, defective, or in need of repair. Prompt reporting of damages, defects, and the need for repairs could prevent deterioration of equipment and possible injury to employees or others. The supervisor can answer any questions about an employee's responsibility for maintenance and care of equipment or vehicles used on the job. The improper, careless, negligent, destructive, or unsafe use or operation of city equipment or vehicles, as well as excessive or avoidable traffic and parking violations on city time, can result In disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
§ 507. - Emergency closings. 
At times, emergencies such as severe weather, fires, power failures, or earthquakes, can disrupt city operations. In extreme cases, these circumstances may require the closing of a work facility. In the event that such an emergency occurs during nonworking hours, local radio and/or television stations will be asked to broadcast notification of the closing. If you are unclear about the status of your duty requirements, call city hall or the police department. 
When operations are officially closed due to emergency conditions, the time off from scheduled work will be paid. Employees in essential operations may be asked to work on a day when operations are officially closed. In these circumstances, employees who work will receive regular pay. 
§ 508. - Business travel expenses. 
The city will reimburse employees for reasonable business travel expenses incurred while on assignments away from the normal work location. All business travel must be approved in advance by the department head. 
Employees whose travel plans have been approved should make all travel arrangements through the administration department. 
When approved, the actual costs of travel, meals, lodging, and other expenses directly related to accomplishing business travel objectives will be reimbursed by the city. Employees are expected to limit expenses to reasonable amounts. 
Any employee who is involved in an accident while traveling on business must promptly report the incident to the immediate supervisor. Vehicles owned, leased, or rented by the city may not be used for personal use without prior approval. 
With prior approval, employees on business travel may be accompanied by a family member or friend, when the presence of a companion will not interfere with successful completion of business objectives. Generally, employees are also permitted to combine personal travel with business travel, as long as time away from work is approved. Additional expenses arising from such nonbusiness travel are the responsibility of the employee. 
When travel is completed, employees should submit completed travel expense reports within ten (10) days. Reports should be accompanied by receipts for all individual expenses. 
Employees should contact their supervisor for guidance and assistance on procedures related to travel arrangements, expense reports, reimbursement for specific expenses, or any other business travel issues. 
Abuse of this business travel expenses policy, including falsifying expense reports to reflect costs not incurred by the employee, can be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
§ 509. - Duties concerning litigation. 
Many times during your employment you may have occasion to be involved, personally or tangentially, in litigation or other judicial proceedings. You have the following responsibilities: 
(1)  Any employee who receives a notice that he is being sued or subpoenaed for any issue that does or may relate to his city responsibilities must be reported immediately to the city administrator, who shall also be given a copy of any documents received. 
(2)  Employees, as a function of their job responsibilities, shall cooperate fully with any investigation conducted by the city or by its agents or lawyers. 
(3)  No employee shall make any statement to any adverse party, investigator, or agent concerning any matter in which the employee knows, or has reasonable cause to know, involves a matter concerning pending or threatened litigation or judicial proceedings, without giving notice to and receiving the approval of the city administrator. 
LEAVES OF ABSENCE 
§ 601. - Family and medical leave. 
Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
(1)  Eligible employee: An employee who has been employed by the city for twelve (12) months on a full-time basis. A "full-time" employee is determined to be one who has worked at least one thousand two hundred and fifty (1,250) hours during the preceding twelve-month period. 
(2)  Serious health condition: Any illness, injury, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care at a hospital or hospital facility or requires continuing treatment by a health care provider. 
(3)  Child: A son or daughter, whether a biological child, adopted child, foster child, stepchild or legal ward who is under eighteen (18) years old or who is over the age of eighteen (18) years but is unable to care for himself or herself due to a disability. 
General provisions. 
During a twelve-month period, each eligible employee shall be entitled to a maximum of twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave due to the birth or adoption of a child or due to the serious health condition of the employee, employee's spouse, child or parent. For leave taken due to the illness of the employee, employee's spouse, child, or parent, the twelve-month period during which leave must be taken shall be measured forward from the date such leave is first taken. For leave taken due to the birth or placement of a child, the twelve-month period shall be measured forward from the date such child is born or placed. When a husband and wife are both eligible employees of the city, their right to leave shall be limited to an aggregate of twelve (12) weeks for leave taken due to the birth or placement of a child or the illness of a parent. Otherwise, their permissible leave shall remain unaltered. 
The employee shall provide the personnel director with notice of the leave at least thirty (30) days in advance, unless medical necessity does not permit such a notice period. The employee shall be required to provide the personnel director with documentation from his or her health care provider to support the leave request. Leave granted without the thirty (30) days' advance notice shall be at the sole discretion of the personnel director. 
Health insurance premiums shall be paid by the city during this absence. 
For the birth or placement of a child, an eligible employee will be required to exhaust any accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave, other family leave or holiday leave that the employee is entitled to under the ordinances of the city prior to taking this leave without pay. For leave due to a serious health condition, an eligible employee will be required to exhaust any accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave, holiday leave or sick leave that the employee is entitled to under the ordinances of the city prior to taking this leave without pay. The aggregate of all leave, including leave without pay, shall not exceed twelve (12) weeks per year. In addition, any eligible employee who takes such medical or family leave without pay shall not be entitled to the accrual of any other leave. 
If an employee does not return to work after the employee has taken medical or family leave without pay, the employee shall be required to reimburse the city for all health insurance premiums and costs incurred by the city during the time that the employee took the leave without pay. The only time in which an employee who does not return to work after leave is taken shall not be required to reimburse the city for health insurance premiums and costs will be when the failure to return is due to the continuation, recurrence or onset of a serious health condition or other such reason beyond the employee's control. 
Intermittent leave. The city shall permit intermittent leave without pay for medical or family purposes only in situations of medical necessity. The employee must submit an application to the personnel director and such application must be supported by documentation from the employee's health care provider as to the medical necessity for such intermittent leave and the expected duration of the leave. When such leave is taken due to a serious health condition, the city reserves the right to move the employee to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits when the alternative position is more accommodating to the intermittent leave schedule. At no time shall the aggregate of intermittent leave time exceed twelve (12) weeks during a twelve-month period. 
Certification. For leave due to a serious health condition, the city reserves the right to require periodic certification from the health care provider for continuation of authorized leave and further reserves the right to require additional independent medical examinations by a physician designated by the city for the purpose of determining continuing eligibility for such leave. 
Reinstatement. All employees taking leave within the guidelines of this section shall be eligible to be reinstated to their position of employment upon their return except if an employee is among the highest paid ten (10) percent of the city's workforce and reinstatement would cause the city substantial and grievous economic injury and the city notifies the employee at the time this determination is made and, after receiving such notice, the employee elects not to return to work and remains on leave status. 
§ 602. - Personal leave. 
The city may provide leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who wish to take time off from work duties to fulfill personal obligations. Employees in the following employment classifications are eligible to request personal leave as described in this policy: 
Department heads 
Regular full-time employees 
As soon as eligible employees become aware of the need for a personal leave of absence, they should request a leave from their supervisor. 
Personal leave may be granted for a period of up to one hundred eighty (180) calendar days every one (1) year. If this initial period of absence proves insufficient, consideration will be given to a written request for a single extension of no more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days. With the supervisor's approval, an employee may take any available sick leave or vacation leave as part of the approved period of leave. 
Requests for personal leave will be evaluated based upon many factors, including anticipated workload requirements and staffing considerations during the proposed period of absence. 
Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, health insurance benefits will be provided by the city until the end of the month in which the approved personal leave begins. At that time, employees will become responsible for the full costs of these benefits if they wish coverage to continue. When the employee returns from personal leave, benefits will again be provided by the city according to the applicable plans. 
Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during the leave and will resume upon return to active employment. 
When a personal leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the employee to the same position, if it is available, or to a similar available position for which the employee is qualified. However, the city cannot guarantee reinstatement in all cases. 
If an employee fails to report to work promptly at the expiration of the approved leave period, the city will assume the employee has resigned. 
§ 603. - Educational leave. 
The city may provide educational leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who wish to take time off from work duties to pursue course work that is applicable to their job duties with the city. Employees in the following employment classifications are eligible to request educational leave as described in this policy: 
Department heads 
Regular full-time employees 
Eligible employees may request educational leave for a period of up to one hundred eighty (180) calendar days every one (1) year. If this initial period of absence proves insufficient, consideration will be given to a written request for a single extension of no more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days. 
Requests will be evaluated based on many factors, including anticipated workload requirements and staffing considerations during the proposed period of absence. 
Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, health insurance benefits will be provided by the city until the end of the month in which the approved educational leave begins. At that time, employees will become responsible for the full costs of these benefits if they wish coverage to continue. 
When the employee returns from educational leave, benefits will again be provided by the city according to the applicable plans. 
Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during the leave and will resume upon return to active employment. 
When an educational leave ends, every reasonable effort will be made to return the employee to the same position, if it is available, or to a similar available position for which the employee is qualified. However, the city cannot guarantee reinstatement in all cases. 
If an employee fails to report to work at the end of the approved leave period, the city will assume that the employee has resigned. 
§ 604. - Reserved. 
§ 605. - Military leave. 
A military leave will be granted as required by law to employees, except those occupying temporary positions, to attend scheduled drills or training or if called to active duty with the U.S. Armed Services. 
The leave will be unpaid, except as required by law. However, employees may use any available paid time off for the absence. Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during the leave and will resume upon the employee's return to active employment. 
Employees on two-week active duty training assignments or inactive duty training drills are required to return to work for the first regularly scheduled shift after the end of training, allowing reasonable travel time. Employees on longer military leave must apply for reemployment in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws. 
Every reasonable effort will be made to return eligible employees to their previous position or a comparable one. They will be treated as though they were continuously employed for purposes of determining benefits based on length of service, such as the rate of vacation accrual and job seniority rights. 
EMPLOYEE CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINARY ACTION 
§ 701. - Employee conduct and work rules. 
To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, the city expects employees to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all employees and the organization. 
It is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the workplace. The use of common sense and good judgment is very important. 
The following, while not an exhaustive list, are examples of infractions of rules of conduct that may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment: 
Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property 
Falsification of records 
Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs 
Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace, while on duty, or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment 
Fighting or threatening violence in the workplace, boisterous or disruptive activity in the workplace 
Negligence or improper conduct leading to damage of city-owned or other property 
Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct 
Violation of safety or health rules 
Smoking in prohibited areas 
Sexual or other unlawful harassment 
Possession of dangerous or unauthorized materials, such as explosives or firearms, in the workplace 
Abuse of sick leave 
Excessive absenteeism or any absence without notice (excessive absenteeism can exist even if sick leave is available) 
Unauthorized absence from workstation during the workday 
Unauthorized use of telephones, mail system, or other employer-owned equipment 
Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
Violation of standards set by personnel policies 
Unsatisfactory performance or conduct 
§ 702. - Drug and alcohol use. 
It is the city's desire to provide a drug-free, healthful, and safe workplace. To promote this goal, employees are required to report to work in appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs in a satisfactory manner. 
While on the city premises and while conducting business-related activities off the city premises, no employee may use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of alcohol or engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of illegal drugs. Violations of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment, and/or required participation in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment program. Such violations may also have legal consequences. 
The legal use of prescribed drugs is permitted on the job only if it does not impair an employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the job effectively and in a safe manner that does not endanger other individuals in the workplace. 
Employees with questions or concerns about substance dependency or abuse are encouraged to discuss these matters with their supervisor or the personnel director to receive assistance or referrals to appropriate resources in the community. 
The mayor and council may from time to time adopt a substance abuse and drug alcohol testing policy which you will be expected to abide by. Employees with drug or alcohol problems that have not resulted in, and are not the immediate subject of, disciplinary action may request approval to take unpaid time off to participate in a rehabilitation or treatment program. Leave may be granted if the employee agrees to abstain from use of the problem substance; abides by all the city policies, rules, and prohibitions relating to conduct in the workplace; and if granting the leave will not cause the city any undue hardship. 
Under the Drug-Free Work Place Act, an employee who performs work for a government contract or grant must notify the city of a criminal conviction for drug-related activity occurring in the workplace. The report must be made within five (5) days of the conviction. 
Employees with questions on this policy or issues related to drug or alcohol use in the workplace should raise their concerns with their supervisor or the personnel director without fear of reprisal. 
§ 703. - Drug testing. 
The city is committed to providing a safe, efficient, and productive work environment for all employees. In keeping with this commitment, employees and certain job applicants may be asked to provide body substance samples (e.g., blood, urine) to determine the illicit use of drugs. The city will attempt to protect the confidentiality of all drug test results. Drug tests may be conducted in any of the following situations: 
Fitness-for-duty: This test may be required if significant and observable changes in employee performance, appearance, behavior, speech, etc., provide reasonable suspicion of the influence of drugs. A fitness-for-duty evaluation may include the testing of a body substance sample. 
Post-accident: Any current employee who is involved in a serious incident or accident while on duty, whether on or off the employer's premises, may be asked to provide a body substance sample. 
Preemployment: As a prequalification to assuming any position, prospective employees are required to provide a body substance sample for drug testing. This occurs in connection with the preemployment medical examination. 
Random: This test may be required of employees in safety sensitive areas. 
Subject to any limitations imposed by law, a refusal to provide a body substance sample under the conditions described above may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
In cases where a positive drug test is confirmed, consideration will be given to available rehabilitation where appropriate. 
An employee who tests positive and who successfully completes rehabilitation will be subject to unscheduled testing following reinstatement. 
Questions concerning this policy or its administration should be directed to the personnel director. 
§ 704. - Sexual and other unlawful harassment. 
The city is committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and unlawful harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual's sex, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or any other legally protected characteristic will not be tolerated. Sexual and other unwanted harassment (both overt and subtle) is a form of employee misconduct that is demeaning to another person, undermines the integrity of the employment relationship, and is strictly prohibited. 
Any employee who wants to report an incident of sexual or other unwanted harassment should promptly report the matter to his or her supervisor. If the supervisor is unavailable or the employee believes it would be inappropriate to contact that person, the employee should immediately contact the personnel director. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal. 
Any supervisor or manager who becomes aware of possible sexual or other unlawful harassment should promptly advise the personnel director, who will handle the matter in a timely and confidential manner. 
Anyone engaging in sexual or other unlawful harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
§ 705. - Attendance and punctuality. 
To maintain a safe and productive work environment, the city expects employees to be reliable and to be punctual in reporting for scheduled work. Absenteeism and tardiness place a burden on other employees and on the city. In the rare instances when employees cannot avoid being late to work or are unable to work as scheduled, they should notify their supervisor as soon as possible in advance of the anticipated tardiness or absence. 
Poor attendance and excessive tardiness are disruptive. Either may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
§ 706. - Personal appearance. 
(1)  Public purpose. The City of Hapeville, Georgia, is a public employer providing public services that are often dangerous, require a presence on private property, and generally required to be fully open and accessible to the public. As such an entity, the city has a reasonable and legitimate public purpose in requiring personal appearance standards including clear guidelines for appropriate and safe attire. The governmental interest in protecting and improving the city's good name, reputation and public image by providing a dress code is a necessary means to promote the normal and effective operation of the business of the city.

The other rules set out herein shall continue to apply and no employee shall dress more casually than as set forth herein.

(Ord. No. 2000-16, § 1, 6-6-2000) 
§ 707. - Return of property. 
Employees are responsible for all property, materials, or written information issued to them or in their possession or control. Employees must return all the city property immediately upon request or upon termination of employment. Where permitted by applicable laws, the city may withhold from the employee's check or final paycheck the cost of any items that are not returned when required. The city may also take all action deemed appropriate to recover or protect its property. 
§ 708. - Resignation. 
Resignation is a voluntary act initiated by the employee to terminate employment with the city. The city requests at least two (2) weeks' written resignation notice from all employees. Failure to give notice may affect your reemployment status. 
Prior to an employee's departure, an exit interview will be scheduled to discuss the reasons for resignation and the effect of the resignation on benefits. 
If an employee does not provide advance notice as requested, the employee will be considered ineligible for rehire. 
Any employee who without valid reason fails to report to work for three (3) consecutive workdays without authorized leave shall be separated from the payroll and reported as a voluntary resignation. 
§ 709. - Security inspections. 
The city wishes to maintain a work environment that is free of illegal drugs, alcohol, firearms, explosives, or other improper materials. To this end, the city prohibits the possession, transfer, sale, or use of such materials on its premises, except as may be allowed or required for public safety employees. The city requires the cooperation of all employees in administering this policy. 
Desks, lockers, and other storage devices may be provided for the convenience of employees but remain the sole property of and under the sole control of the city. Accordingly, they, as well as any articles found within them, can be inspected by your immediate supervisor at any time. Reasonable attempts to notify you of such an inspection and allow you to attend shall be made by the inspecting agent. Elected officials shall not participate in such inspections. The routine practice of looking for office materials, files, supplies, etc., made during the normal course of affairs, shall not be considered an "inspection," and all employees should understand that contraband that may be found under such circumstances may be noted and acted upon. 
§ 710. - Solicitation. 
To ensure a productive and harmonious work environment, persons not employed by the city may not solicit or distribute literature or merchandise in the workplace at any time for any purpose. 
The city recognizes that employees may have interests in events and organizations outside the workplace. However, employees may not solicit or distribute literature or merchandise concerning these activities during working time without the permission of the department head of the employee. (Working time does not include lunch periods, work breaks, or any other periods in which employees are not on duty.) The department head should only authorize solicitation for charitable or nonprofit causes. 
In addition, the posting of written solicitations on city bulletin boards is prohibited. Bulletin boards are reserved for official organization communications on such items as: 
Affirmative action statement 
Employee announcements 
Internal memoranda 
Job openings 
Organization announcements 
Payday notice 
Workers' compensation insurance information 
State disability insurance/unemployment insurance information 
§ 711. - Exit interview. 
All employees being separated from the city service shall be required to have an exit interview with the personnel director, a report of which shall be made to the city administrator. 
§ 712. - Political activity. 
Employees of the city are encouraged to exercise their right to vote, but no employee shall make use of city time or equipment to aid a political candidate, political party or political cause, or use a city position to persuade, coerce, or intimidate any person in the interest of a political candidate, political party, or political cause. 
§ 713. - Internet use policy. 
(a)  Statement of purpose of internet use policy. The internet is a worldwide network of computer systems connecting educational institutions, government agencies, businesses, industries, individuals, and other entities. Millions of people use the internet to communicate, conduct business, access information, socialize, and find entertainment. Most information available over the internet is of sound value. Unfortunately, a small portion of information available over the internet is considered questionable, offensive, pornographic, illegal, or otherwise objectionable. Additionally and as employees should be aware, certain uses of the internet may constitute improper or illegal activities including, but not limited to, sexual and other types of harassment and discriminatory conduct through use of e-mail, downloaded images, etc. Consequently and to ensure the proper use of the internet by its employees, the City of Hapeville, Georgia, adopts the following internet use policy (hereinafter referred to as the "policy"). 
(b)  Definition of "internet." For the purposes of this policy, the "internet" shall mean the city's computer network, intracity and internet electronic mail, the worldwide web, and any other information or means of communication accessed by a personal computer from a resource other than one of that computer's internal drives. 
(c)  Requirements. 
(1)  Employees shall not access the internet through a city computer without the written approval of their department head or the city administrator. Each employee granted such approval shall sign an internet and electronic mail use agreement and shall be assigned a personal internet account. 
(2)  Each employee using the internet will be held solely and fully responsible for any use of his or her account. Additionally, all employees shall assume full liability, legal, financial or otherwise, for their actions when accessing the internet with a city computer. 
(3)  In the event an employee uses the internet in violation of this policy and the city as a result incurs expenses, including but not limited to attorney's fees, costs of litigation, and any judgment against the city, the employee shall indemnify the city for all such expenses. 
(4)  Employees shall familiarize themselves with and abide by the requirements of the policy. Any violation of any of the policy's requirements may result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to restriction or revocation of internet access privileges, or even termination of employment. 
(5)  Employees shall not, through their internet account or use of a city computer, use the internet to: 
a.  Engage in any activity prohibited by law. 
b.  Create, transfer, view, store or otherwise use any text, image, or sound recording that contains pornography, profanity, vulgarity, obscenity, or other language or images tending to offend or degrade others. 
c.  Intentionally use invasive or destructive software such as "viruses" or "worms." 
d.  Transfer, use, duplicate, or store materials in violation of copyright laws, license agreements, or intellectual property rights of others. 
e.  Access without permission another's folders, work, or files. 
f.  Interfere with the normal and proper operation of the internet.

APPEAL PROCESS 
§ 801. - Appeal of disciplinary action. 
Any regular full-time employee who has been dismissed, suspended, demoted, or otherwise disciplined for cause, whereby he suffers any loss in salary, grade, or classification, shall have the right to appeal such action to the personnel board. This right must be exercised in writing at any time within three (3) working days from the date of his being notified of the action. The grounds for appeal to the personnel board shall be limited to those cases wherein the employee alleges a factual error or that the action was taken for personal, political or religious reasons. Department heads are not considered regular full-time employees for the purposes of appeals to the personnel board. Department heads are not eligible for personnel board appeals of employment decisions and are at-will employees who may be terminated with or without cause by a majority vote of the mayor and council. 
(Ord. No. 2000-09, § 2, 3-7-2000) 
§ 802. - Format. 
(1)  An appeals hearing before the personnel board is a quasijudicial proceeding. As such, it should be conducted at a place conducive to the maintenance of a judicial atmosphere. At the hearing, the conduct of the parties shall be dignified, both on and off the record. 
Misconduct before the personnel board may be grounds for summary exclusion from the hearing. The hearing is intended to receive evidence either to refute or to substantiate specific charges which led to the appeal. It shall not be a forum for discussion of extraneous or irrelevant matters having no bearing on the charges, and the alleged misconduct of others who may have escaped discipline in the past shall serve as no defense to a charge of misconduct. All parties at action and witnesses shall be given ample time and opportunity to develop points, subject to the discretion of the personnel board. 
(2)  The personnel board, personnel director, and the attorney representing the personnel board shall not be advocates for or against either party. It shall be the duty of the personnel board to be impartial in its conduct and rulings, both on and off the record. The board may examine, call and question witnesses and may call for and introduce appropriate documentary evidence, being limited only by the relevance of the evidence to the issues. 
(3)  It should be recognized that the personnel board will be composed of private citizens. Accordingly, the board may not follow established legal procedures as might be expected in a court of law. However, in taking testimony and in considering the evidence, the personnel board shall follow accepted legal procedure insofar as is practicable. It shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence observed in courts of law. The board may listen to hearsay testimony and may accept depositions and affidavits, if such testimony is material and relevant to the issues. 
§ 803. - Hearings. 
(1)  Each appeal shall be heard by the personnel board at the earliest practicable date following the receipt of an appeal request. 
(2)  The personnel director shall send out a written notice of the time, date and place of the hearing. This notice shall be sent to the employee appealing and/or his authorized representative and the appointing authority. 
(3)  The general policy of the personnel board concerning postponements shall be that cases set for hearings will be heard on the dates set, and that postponements will be granted only for good cause. Postponement of the opening date of a hearing shall be at the discretion of the chairman of the personnel board. 
§ 804. - Prehearing conference. 
(1)  If deemed appropriate to the circumstances of the case, either the appointing authority or the appellant may arrange a prehearing conference with the personnel director prior to the hearing in order to consider and determine the following elements: 
a.  Simplification of the issues. 
b.  Possible conciliation and settlement without a hearing. 
c.  Limitation on the number of witnesses. 
d.  Acceptance of evidence of deposition. 
e.  Stipulation as to any uncontested facts. 
f.  Other matters that may aid in the disposition of the appeal. 
(2)  An electronic recording of transactions may be made during prehearing conferences upon request of either party at interest. 
§ 805. - Witnesses. 
The chairman of the board or the personnel board attorney shall administer the oath to witnesses. In the event that a prehearing conference has not limited the number of witnesses and the number of witnesses asked for seems to be excessive, in the discretion of the personnel board, the party requesting them may be required to justify his request before the personnel board. The board may decline to listen to numerous character witnesses or numbers of witnesses testifying to identical facts. The personnel board, through its personnel director, may subpoena witnesses, documents and records as necessary. 
§ 806. - Counsel or representation. 
Appellants appearing before the personnel board may, if desired, be represented by legal counsel at their expense, or they may act as their own counsel and conduct their own hearings. Appointing authorities and the personnel board will be assisted by the city attorney and his staff, as requested. 
§ 807. - Transcripts. 
A certified court reporter may, if desired, be employed by either party at interest, at their expense. 
§ 808. - Order of hearing. 
The appointing authority shall make the initial presentation in an effort to prove that the action under appeal was taken for cause. The employee may rebut the appointing authority's allegations at the conclusion of the appointing authority's presentation and may attempt to show that the action was taken for personal, religious or political reasons or that the decision was based upon factual error. After the presentation of all evidence, the personnel board may hear closing arguments and shall then take the case under advisement and render a decision at the earliest practicable date. 
§ 809. - Board order. 
(1)  The personnel board may not weigh the sufficiency of the cause for adverse personnel action. The personnel board may reverse the decision of the appointing authority only on a finding that it was based on error of fact or was motivated by personal, religious or political reasons. Otherwise, it shall affirm the decision. 
(2)  If the personnel board finds in favor of the employee, he shall be reinstated to his prior condition, with no loss of pay. 
(3)  The personnel board, after reaching a decision in the case, shall cause an order to be prepared, setting forth their decision and directing appropriate remedies, if any, to resolve the appeal. Except as provided below, the decision of the personnel board in such cases shall be final and conclusive, in the absence of an appellant review in the courts (certiorari). Copies of the board order shall be made a matter of official record and shall be furnished to all parties at interest. 
(4)  If, in the opinion of the mayor, the personnel board has exceeded its legal authority by considering issues over which it has no jurisdiction or ordering relief in excess of its authorization, he may, within three (3) business days, veto the action of the personnel board. This veto may be overridden by a majority vote of the council at the next regular meeting. If a veto is overridden, the decision of the appointing authority shall stand. 
§ 810. - Transfers. 
Any employee, regardless of status, may be transferred to any position within his department or to another department or facility at the sole discretion of the city. The city shall be the final arbitrator of all interdepartmental or intradepartmental transfers and the sole judge of the need, necessity, convenience or reason for such transfer. An interdepartmental or intradepartmental transfer shall not be construed to be a demotion or disciplinary action even if it results in a reduction of the employee's pay or a change in job responsibilities.
