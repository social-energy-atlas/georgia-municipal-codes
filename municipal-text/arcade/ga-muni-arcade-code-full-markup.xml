         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Arcade, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code, as updated through February 8, 2016, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code, as updated, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments

                  The publisher is most grateful to Jody Campbell, Deborah Mockus, and Ron Smith for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

               (b)  The city council may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon report by the mayor and adoption of a resolution, both finding that the property is not needed for public or other purposes and that the interest of the city has no readily ascertainable monetary value. 
               (c)  Whenever in opening, extending, or widening any street, avenue, alley, or public place of the city, a small parcel or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the city, the city council may authorize the mayor to execute and deliver in the name of the city a deed conveying said cut-off or separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining property owner or owners in exchange for rights-of-way of said street, avenue, alley, or public place when such exchange is deemed to be in the best interest of the city.

The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time as the Code and subsequent ordinances omitted are readopted as a new Code by the city council. 
                  (b)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code should be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section of this Code in substantially the following language: "That section ____________ of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Arcade, Georgia, is hereby amended to read as follows…."

                  (b)  When any ordinance repealing a former Code section, ordinance, clause, or provision, shall be itself repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive such former Code section, ordinance, clause, or provision, unless it shall be expressly so provided. 
                  (c)  An ordinance which is in conflict in its entirety with a subsequent ordinance shall be deemed to be repealed in its entirety, even if no specific repealer is stated. If an ordinance is only partially in conflict with a subsequent ordinance, only the portion of the previous ordinance in conflict with the subsequent ordinance shall be deemed to have been repealed, even if a specific repealer is not stated.

                  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city council that the sections, subsections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, and phrases of this Code are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, subsection, or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, subsections, and sections of this Code.

                  (1)  A person convicted of a violation of this Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 and costs, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or both such fine and imprisonment, or any or all of such penalties to be imposed at the discretion of the judge of the municipal court. 
                  (2)  With respect to violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues is a separate offense. 
                  (3)  With respect to violations of this Code that are not continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues is a separate offense. 
                  (d)  The imposition of a penalty does not prevent revocation or suspension of a license, permit or franchise or other administrative sanctions. 
                  (e)  Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief and by such other means as are provided by law. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent equitable relief.

                  Sec. 1-11. - Substantive compliance with Code. 
                  Substantive compliance with any requirement of this Code, or ordinances, especially on the part of public officers, shall be deemed and held sufficient, and no proceeding shall be declared void for want of such compliance, unless expressly so provided by the enactment.

                  (b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.

For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles.

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-15. - Ordinances not affected by adoption of the Code.

                  (f)  As to any location licensed in the future, if the distance requirements herein are met at the time of issuance of any license, the subsequent opening and operation of a house of worship or school within the distance prohibited herein shall not prevent the continuance of an existing license or the renewal thereof or the issuance of a new license to any subsequent owner of such property; provided, however, that the distance requirements herein shall not apply at any location for which a new license is applied for if the sale of alcoholic beverages was lawful at such location at any time during the 12 months immediately preceding such application.

                  (e)  In all instances in which an application is denied under the provisions of this chapter, the applicant may not reapply for a license for at least one year from the final date of such denial.

                  Sec. 4-8. - Withdrawal of application. 
                  Any license application made pursuant to this chapter may be withdrawn by the applicant at any time.

                  (Code 1992, § 32-301(I)(H); Ord. of 3-12-2012, § 32-301(I)(H)) 
                  Sec. 4-9. - Licensing qualifications. 
                  (a)  No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be granted to any person who is not a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. 
                  (b)  Where the applicant is a partnership or corporation, the provisions of this section shall apply to all its partners, officers, and majority stockholders. In the case of a corporation, the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and the majority stockholder, if an individual.

                  (c)  No person shall be granted any alcoholic beverage license unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the city administrator or his designee that such person, partners in the firm, or officers and directors of the corporation have not been convicted of or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere and have been released from parole or probation for, any crime involving moral turpitude; illegal gambling; illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law; keeping a place of prostitution; pandering; pimping; public indecency; prostitution; solicitation of sodomy; or any sex-related crime within a period of ten years immediately prior to the filing of such application. At the time an application is submitted for any alcoholic beverage license, the applicant shall, by a duly sworn affidavit, certify that neither the applicant, nor any of the other owners of the establishment, have been convicted or have pleaded guilty to or entered a plea of nolo contendere and have been released from parole or probation to any crime involving moral turpitude; illegal gambling; illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law; keeping a place of prostitution; pandering; pimping; public indecency; prostitution; solicitation of sodomy; or any sex-related crime within a period of ten years immediately prior to the filing of such application. An applicant's first-time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a city ordinance shall not, by itself, make an applicant ineligible for an alcohol license. Should any applicant, partner, or officer used in the sale or dispensing of any alcoholic beverage, after a license has been granted, be convicted or plead guilty or nolo contendere to a crime involving moral turpitude; illegal gambling; illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law; keeping a place of prostitution; pandering; pimping; public indecency; prostitution; solicitation of sodomy; or any sex-related crime, the license shall be immediately revoked and cancelled.

                  (e)  It shall be unlawful for any city employee directly involved in the issuance of alcoholic beverage licenses under this chapter to have any whole, partial or beneficial interest in any license to sell alcoholic beverages in the city. 
                  (f)  No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be granted to any person who has had any license issued under the police powers of the city previously revoked within two years prior to the filing of the application. 
                  (g)  The city council may decline to issue a license when any person having any ownership interest in the operation of such place of business or control over such place of business does not meet the same character requirements as herein set forth for the licensee. 
                  (h)  All licensed establishments must have and continuously maintain in the county a registered agent upon whom any process, notice or demand required or permitted by law or under this chapter to be served upon the licensee or owner may be served. This person must be a resident of the county. The licensee shall file the name of such agent, along with the written consent of such agent, with the city administrator or his designee in such form as he may prescribe. 
                  (i)  The city council, in its discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances which may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application or the proposed location of the business. If, in their judgment, circumstances are such that granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application. 
                  (j)  For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which the defendant was allowed to avail themselves of the Georgia First Offender Act (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.) as amended; except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender. 
                  (Code 1992, § 32-301(I)(I); Ord. of 3-12-2012, § 32-301(I)(I))

                  In the event any person shall fail to pay the sum due under this chapter, the city administrator or his designee shall issue an execution against the person so delinquent, and his property, for the amount of the delinquent fee or tax. 
                  (Code 1992, § 32-301(I)(L); Ord. of 3-12-2012, § 32-301(I)(L))

                  (b)  In case of the death of a licensee, the establishment shall be allowed to continue to sell alcoholic beverages for a period of 45 days from the date of death, or until expiration of the license, or until approval of a new licensee, whichever shall first occur; provided that no sale of alcoholic beverages shall be allowed until such time as a personal representative of the estate, appointed by a probate court of competent jurisdiction, shall make application for authorization with the city administrator or his designee. 
                  (c)  In the event that a license is surrendered, or a licensee severs his association with a licensed establishment, the establishment may continue to sell alcoholic beverages for a period of 45 days from the date of surrender, or from the date determined by the city administrator or his designee to be the date of severance; provided that no such sale shall be authorized until such time as a new application for a license is made, said application indicating that no change of ownership has occurred, except as excepted herein. Upon issuance of a new license, the authorization to sell under the previous license shall be revoked by operation of law. No additional license fees shall be required during the period for which the original license was issued. 
                  (d)  Nothing in this section, however, shall prohibit one or more of the partnership holding a license to withdraw from the partnership in favor of one or more of the partners who were partners at the time of the issuance of the license. This section shall not prohibit transfer of stock between persons who held stock in the corporation at the time of issuance of the license, nor shall it prohibit transfers of stock which do not result in any person increasing his stock holdings to a total of ten percent or more of any class of stock. 
                  (e)  Except as provided above, any change in the ownership of any entity owning a licensed establishment shall cancel and revoke any license hereunder automatically, without the necessity of any hearing. 
                  (f)  Violation of this section shall result in revocation of the license being used and a fine on the new ownership and the old ownership of not less than $500.00 and/or 30 days in jail. No license will be issued to the old or the new owner in the city for one year from the date of the violation. 
                  (g)  Should a licensee make application to the city administrator or his designee for a transfer of location, and should such a transfer of a location be approved, with no change of ownership of the business, the license fee paid for the previous license shall be applied to the new location. Each applicant for a transfer of location shall pay a transfer fee as indicated on the fee schedule.

Applications for renewal must be filed before December 31 of each year. Any renewal applications received after December 31 shall pay, in addition to said annual fee, a late charge of 25 percent. If license application is received after January 15, such application shall be treated as an initial application and the applicant shall be required to comply with all rules and regulations for the granting of licenses as if no previous license had been held. If license application is received after January 15, investigative and administrative costs will be assessed. 
                  (b)  All licenses granted hereunder shall be for the calendar year and the full license fee must be paid for a license application filed prior to July 1 of the license year.

                  (a)  A license may be suspended or revoked by the city administrator or his designee where the licensee furnishes fraudulent or untruthful information in the application for a license and/or for failure to pay all fees, taxes or other charges imposed under the provisions of this chapter.

                  (g)  An act or omission of a licensee, owner of more than 20 percent interest in the licensed establishment, or employee of the licensee or licensed establishment willingly or knowingly performed, which constitutes a violation of federal or state law, or of any provision of this chapter, will subject the licensee to suspension or revocation of his license in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, when the city administrator or his designee determines to his own satisfaction that the act or omission did occur, regardless of whether any criminal prosecution or conviction ensues; provided, however, in the case of an employee, the city administrator or his designee must determine that the acts of the employee were known to the licensee or under reasonable circumstances should have been known to the licensee, were condoned by the licensee, or where the licensee has not established practices or procedures to prevent the violation from occurring. 
                  (h)  Whenever it can be shown that a licensee hereunder no longer maintains adequate financial responsibility upon which issuance of the license was conditioned, or whenever the licensee has defaulted in any obligation of any kind whatsoever, lawfully owing to the city, the license may be suspended or revoked by the city administrator or his designee. 
                  (i)  Wherever this chapter permits the city administrator or his designee to suspend any license issued hereunder, but does not mandate the period of such suspension, such discretion shall be exercised within the following guidelines of this subsection: 
                  (1)  No suspension shall be for a period of time longer than the time remaining on such license. 
                  (2)  The following factors shall be considered on any revocation or suspension as set out above: 
                  a.  Consistency of penalties mandated by this chapter and those set by the city administrator or his designee. 
                  b.  Likelihood of deterring future wrongdoing. 
                  c.  Impact of the offense in the community.

The appellant shall have the burden of proof on any such appeal. Before hearing an appeal, each member of the city council shall sign an affidavit to be part of the record that he is not related to, or personal friends with, any owner of the licensed establishment in question in the appeal being considered, and that he has no financial interest in the outcome of the appeal. Should any member be unable to sign such an affidavit, that member shall not serve on that appeal and the case shall be heard by the remaining members of the city council. 
                  (d)  The findings of the city council shall be forwarded to the appellant within 15 days after the conclusion of the hearing. 
                  (e)  The findings of the city council shall not be set aside unless found to be:

Each building in which the business will be located shall contain sufficient lighting so that the building itself and the premises on all sides of the building are readily visible at all times from the front of the street on which the building is located, so as to reveal all of the outside premises of such building.

                  (a)  The city shall have the opening and conclusion of each case, unless the defendant introduces no evidence; then he shall be entitled to the conclusion.

The same rules as to examination of witnesses and the evidence adduced as obtained in such courts, as far as they are applicable to examining courts, shall be applicable to cases before the municipal court. The party accused shall have the privilege of defending himself, by counsel or by himself, or both, whichever shall seem proper to him.

Any police officer, by virtue of such attachment, shall arrest and confine the person, so as to have him before the court at such time as may be appointed for further hearing of the original complaint. 
                  (Code 1992, § 5-109) 
                  Sec. 16-9. - Continuances. 
                  Where the ends of justice require it, cases may be continued. All continuances shall be addressed to the sound legal discretion of the court under the rules governing the superior courts of the state. 
                  (Code 1992, § 5-110) 
                  Sec. 16-10. - Plea of guilty in absence of defendant. 
                  Any party against whom any compliant is lodged or information given may file a plea of guilty under such regulations and upon terms as the court may prescribe and, if such party cannot attend the trial, the court may pass such order or sentence in the case as if the party were personally present, if the defendant consents thereto.

                  Sec. 16-11. - Persons implicated to be tried. 
                  If, on the trial of any cause before the municipal court, it appears that any other person besides the one on trial has violated a provision of this Code or any city ordinance, he may then and there be tried if present, unless the case is continued for legal cause. 
                  (Code 1992, § 5-113) 
                  Sec. 16-12. - Docket. 
                  A docket shall be kept in the office of the clerk of court on which shall appear the name of every defendant charged with a violation of this Code or any city ordinances, or of any offense over which the municipal court has jurisdiction and, at the trial of all cases in the municipal court, the municipal court judge shall record opposite the statement of the case the punishment inflicted and the date; and the clerk of the court shall enter, under the municipal court judge's sentence, the final disposition of the case (i.e., whether the fine, if any, was collected and the date of such collection, and when and to whom such amounts were turned over by the clerk of the court). 
                  (Code 1992, § 5-115) 
                  Sec. 16-13. - Enforcement of penalties against corporations. 
                  Whenever a corporation shall violate any provision of this Code or any city ordinance, a warrant shall be issued against such corporation for violating such provisions, and the clerk of the court shall issue a copy of such warrant, which shall be served by the police chief or any city police officer upon any officer of the corporation; and the police officer serving such copy shall at the time notify such person upon whom such service is made of the time and place of trial, and shall make an entry of such service upon the warrant, showing the time of service and upon whom the service was made, and return the same to the municipal court, and docket the case, which case shall stand for trial in the order which other cases against individuals for violation of city ordinances are tried. If, on the trial, the defendant corporation fails to appear, or appearing fails to plead, the judge of the municipal court shall cause to be entered a plea of not guilty, and trial shall proceed as though the defendant has appeared and pleaded. Upon conviction of any corporation, there shall be rendered judgment against it for the fine imposed by the presiding officer, together with all costs of prosecution, upon which judgment the clerk of the court shall issue an execution against the defendant, which shall be levied and collected by the police chief as tax executions in favor of the city are now allowed by law to be levied and collected. 
                  (Code 1992, § 5-116) 
                  Sec. 16-14. - Appearance bond—Security requirement; maximum amount. 
                  The police chief, a member of the police department, the municipal court judge, the sheriff of the county, or his deputy may take bond, with security or without security, at his discretion in a sum not exceeding $1,000.00 for the appearance of any party accused or suspected of being guilty of a violation of any provision of this Code or any city ordinance, or any offense over which the municipal court has jurisdiction, to stand to and abide by his trial before the municipal court, and also of witnesses to testify in any case pending or about to be commenced in such court. 
                  (Code 1992, § 5-117) 
                  Sec. 16-15. - Same—Failure or refusal to give, subsequent confinement or guard. 
                  If either party or witness shall fail or refuse to give the bond and security as required of them, or either of them, such person so failing or refusing may be confined to the jail of the county, or other place in the county as may be directed by the municipal court judge, so as to be present to abide the trial or to testify, as the case may be. 
                  (Code 1992, § 5-118) 
                  Sec. 16-16. - Same—Forfeiture for failure to appear; service of rule. 
                  All bail taken under this chapter shall be special bail, and the power of the security over the principal shall be the same as in the special bail. Upon the failure of any principal to appear in any bond or recognizance given by a person charged with a violation of any provision of this Code or any city ordinance, or of any offense over which municipal court has jurisdiction, or by a witness to appear and testify, the presiding officer shall pass a rule requiring the principal and sureties on such bond to show cause on a day therein named not to be less than ten days from the passage of such rule, why he should not be required to pay the amount of such bond. A copy of such rule shall be served upon the principal and security by any officer or member of the police force at least five days before the time therein set for hearing the same. 
                  (Code 1992, § 5-119) 
                  Sec. 16-17. - Same—Judgment. 
                  If no sufficient cause is shown, the municipal judge shall proceed to enter judgment against such principal and sureties for the amount of the bond forfeited as provided herein, and the city clerk shall issue execution for the amount of such judgment and place the same in the hands of the police chief, who shall proceed to collect the same by levy and sale as in case of tax executions. 
                  (Code 1992, § 5-120) 
                  Sec. 16-18. - Same—Surrender of principal. 
                  Any surety upon a bail bond of any person charged with a violation of a provision of this Code or a city ordinance, or of any offense over which the municipal court has jurisdiction, may surrender his principal at any time to the police chief, who shall confine such principal, until discharged by order of the judge of the municipal court, or other proper officer, or by giving other and good security. The delivery of the principal as aforesaid shall discharge the surety of all further liability upon such bond, provided that delivery shall be before any judgment of forfeiture upon the bond shall have been entered. 
                  (Code 1992, § 5-121) 
                  Sec. 16-19. - Professional bondsman. 
                  (a)  No professional bondsman shall be accepted as surety on a bail bond unless he has deposited with the city clerk the sum of $5,000.00 to guarantee the payment of any bond, if forfeited, which he may sign. In the event the defendant named in any bond signed by a professional bondsman fails to appear according to the conditions of the bond, and the bond is forfeited, the city clerk shall deduct the amount of the bond from the deposit made as herein required and pay the same into the city treasury. If at any time the balance on deposit diminishes to $2,500.00 or less, the bondsman shall not be accepted as surety on a bail bond again until he has deposited with the city clerk an amount sufficient to restore the deposit to the original required amount. 
                  (b)  Qualifications. Professional bondsmen shall meet the following qualifications: 
                  (1)  Each bondsman shall provide the city with a current period financial statement, including a documented balance sheet. 
                  (2)  Each bondsman shall provide the city with a copy of his business license. 
                  (3)  Each bondsman shall provide a written proposal outlining the steps he takes as a surety to identify and locate potential defendants who fail to appear on the original court date. 
                  (4)  Each bondsman shall provide a written history of his experience in the bonding business, including a statement listing the principals, officers, directors, and shareholders of his corporation. 
                  (5)  Each bondsman shall update this information annually. 
                  (6)  Each bondsman shall submit to and must pass a full investigation by the police chief, including a state and federal criminal history check. Any information which demonstrates any involvement in criminal activity shall be grounds for disqualification of the applicant.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 24-1. - Authorization. 
                  Ga. Const. art. IX, § II and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. 
                  (Ord. of 1-14-2013, art. 1, § A) 
                  Sec. 24-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The city flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated or floodproofed, or are otherwise unprotected from flood damages; and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 1-14-2013, art. 1, § B) 
                  Sec. 24-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 1-14-2013, art. 1, § C)

                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Sec. 24-11. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
                  The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
                  (Ord. of 1-14-2013, art. 2, § G)

An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this chapter. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after December 17, 2010, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced after December 17, 2010, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after December 17, 2010. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure (accessory structures are not exempt from any chapter requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. 
                  (1)  The market value of the structure should be: 
                  a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  (2)  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
                  a.  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.  Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 24-68(4). All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this section, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this section and in section 24-47(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:

                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood; must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (see section 24-68(6)). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a through c of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 24-6 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 24-92. - Procedures. 
                  (a)  The planning and zoning commission, as established by the city council, shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The planning and zoning commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city council in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the planning and zoning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this section and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor, and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The city administrator or his designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this chapter, the planning and zoning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

In addition to any other penalty which may be provided, the city council may revoke the license of any licensed proprietor of a licensed business in the city who refuses to permit any officer or employee who is authorized to make such inspection or take such sample to make the inspection, or take an adequate sample of the said commodity, or who interferes with such officer or employee while in the performance of his duty in making such inspection; provided that no license shall be revoked for such cause unless written demand is made upon the licensee or person in charge of the premises, in the name of the city, stating that such inspection or sample is desired at the time it is sought to make the inspection or obtain the sample.

                  (1)  If the repair of the said property can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to its present value, the order shall require the owner, within a specified time not to exceed 30 days, to repair such property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to effect a closing of any structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair of the said property, in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations, cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value thereof, the order shall require the owner, within a specified time not to exceed 30 days, to demolish and remove the noncompliant dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. For purposes of this section, in cases in which the nuisance complained of is a dwelling, building, or structure of any kind, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors with a current business license to do work in the county, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations. 
                  (h)  Remedies of public officer in the event of noncompliance with order. 
                  (1)  The order entered under subsection (g) of this section shall further provide that, if the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, demolish, or close the property within the specified time, the public officer may cause such property to be repaired, demolished, or closed. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of the time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer is also authorized to file a motion for attachment for contempt against the owner with the court which issued the order as an alternate or additional remedy. 
                  (2)  If the public officer chooses to have the work done as ordered on any dwelling building or structure, he shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words, including the Spanish translation: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (i)  Salvage. If the public officer has a structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any monies received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. Neither the public officer nor the county shall have any liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.

The clerk of the superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien for costs of abatement on the general execution docket. Such lien should cross reference the order and include the original caption and case number from the nuisance abatement action. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid in full. 
                  (b)  Enforcement of lien. 
                  (1)  Upon a final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this chapter, the public officer shall transmit to the municipal tax collector or city revenue officer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the municipal tax collector or city revenue officer to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. title 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78, which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure, shall not apply. The municipal tax collector or city revenue officer shall remit the amount collected to the general fund of the city. 
                  (2)  Enforcement of liens may be initiated at any time following receipt by the municipal tax collector or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
                  (3)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the county and the tax commissioner in the enforcement of the lien. Redemption of the property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (c)  Waiver of lien. The city council may waive and release any such lien imposed on property of the owner for costs incurred by the city up to the time of the entry of the order and any additional costs incurred subsequent thereto in attempting to bring the property into compliance by entering into a contract with the owner in which the owner agrees to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property, and demonstrates the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.

                  (8)  Names that may be offensive (slang, words with double-meanings) will not be allowed. 
                  (9)  Road names will be continuous throughout their entire length, when feasible. 
                  (10)  Names which have homonyms (i.e., other words pronounced similarly but spelled differently) should not be used on any street and certainly not on multiple streets even if the street type is different (e.g., Steven Lane/Stephen Lane; Disk Drive/Disc Lane).

                  Whenever a change to an approved and addressed road name is requested by a property owner or developer with access to the subject road, the following procedures shall apply. 
                  (1)  A complete application shall be made with the Jackson County Department of Public Development which shall be accompanied by a petition signed by 66 percent (two-thirds) or more of the property owners adjoining the said road in agreement. (An affected property owner is one who owns an interest in property contiguous to the street.) A nonrefundable application fee of $250.00 must be submitted to the Jackson County Public Development Department prior to processing; provided, however, applications initiated by city or county staff will have no fees associated with them. 
                  (2)  Within 30 days of submittal the department will determine the percentage of the affected property owners that has signed the petition. If less than 66 percent of the affected property owners have signed the petition, it will not be processed and will be returned to the applicant. If 66 percent or more have signed, the department will review the proposed road name for compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (3)  If the proposed road name meets all criteria provided in the GISOP, the proposed road name will be placed on a "reserve list" in the road book. A letter will then be sent by the Jackson County GIS department to affected county departments for review and comments. If the requested name change receives any unfavorable comments, the Jackson County GIS Department will schedule a meeting with affected departments and agencies to develop recommendations as to the beginning and ending points of said change (if necessary), or name change, or any road number changes that may be applicable. 
                  (4)  After review and acceptance by the county departments of the request, and if 66 percent or more of the affected property owners have signed a petition, then the proposal will be placed on the agenda of the Arcade City Council. If all of the affected property owners do not agree to the requested road name change, or if less than 100 percent have signed the petition, then an advertised public hearing before the Arcade City Council will be scheduled and held. Note, however, that at least 66 percent of the affected property owners must sign the petition for it to be accepted for processing. 
                  (5)  A notice advertising the name change shall be required to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and county at least 15 days, but not more than 45 days, before the public hearing. 
                  (6)  If, after public hearing, the name change is approved by the Arcade City Council, then the county departments will make changes as necessary and again notify affected property owners and public agencies in writing at least ten days before the change becomes effective. 
                  (7)  The applicant for road name change that has been approved shall be responsible for revising any final plats and paying any associated fees. The applicant shall also be responsible for the cost of new road name signs that will replace existing road name signs.

                  Road names (public or private) may be changed by the Jackson County GIS Department as necessary for health, safety and welfare reasons and efficiency of the emergency response system. Owners of adjoining properties shall be notified in writing that the change is taking place and provided a list of proposed road names from which input shall be considered. A selection will be chosen after receiving input and be presented to the Arcade City Council for approval. For any case in which a continuous road has multiple names, the Jackson County GIS Department will determine the correct name and notify owners along such road of the name change. In the event of a conflict in either road naming or addressing, the Jackson County GIS Department will use its best judgment to resolve the conflict and have the responsibility of notifying the owner, E 9-1-1, USPS, and other agencies.

                  Sec. 35-34. - Assignment and standards. 
                  Addresses shall be determined based on the distance from the intersection of the driveway with the road and the current surrounding addresses, if compliant with this chapter. Additional standards used to determine addresses are as provided in the GISOP. 
                  (1)  Multiple structures sharing driveway. If more than two addressable structures access a common driveway as defined, that driveway will be assigned a private road name and all addresses will be assigned along such private road. 
                  (2)  Corner and multiple fronting parcels. Corner or double fronting parcels shall be assigned an address based on the driveway location of the intersecting road. If that entrance is not visible from that road or is inaccessible for emergency services, then the address shall be based on the road which the structure faces. 
                  (3)  Duplex/attached structures. Each unit of structure shall receive its own individual address as determined by the Jackson County GIS Department. This would include townhouses and condominiums. 
                  (4)  Multiple unit structures. Separate internal units within, or associated with, residential or commercial complexes shall have an individual address and be uniquely identified by the use of a unit type. All educational, medical, residential, industrial facilities, and/or any other type of property with private roads that is sold shall not be allowed to change addressing or road names without written approval of the Jackson County GIS Department. If road names or addresses are changed without approval, the property owner will be subject to penalties as provided for in this chapter. 
                  (5)  Vacant parcels. Vacant parcels less than one acre may be pre-addressed at the discretion of the Jackson County GIS Department. This pre-address shall be assigned to the center point of the parcel frontage. All other parcels will not carry an address until placement of a structure. 
                  (6)  Miscellaneous structures. Structures requiring an address for metering or permitting purposes shall be given their own individual address and a unit designator. These structures may include billboards/signs, power poles, utility assets and others. 
                  (7)  Mobile/manufactured home parks. Mobile home lots shall have sequential address numbers throughout the mobile home park. Each lot will have a separate address number assigned. The address number of each lot must be clearly displayed on the mobile home which is located on that lot and must be clearly visible from the road. If the lot is more than 50 feet from the road, the address number shall be displayed at the end of the road or easement giving access to that mobile home. Addresses are not transferrable with the mobile home. 
                  (8)  Wireless towers. Wireless towers shall be assigned one address to the tower owner. Should the tower have multiple carriers, each earner will be assigned a suite number that will include the address of the tower owner. A sign or post which clearly indicated the address number assigned to the tower shall be located at the entry point of the road on which the tower is located.

                  The Jackson County GIS Department shall develop and maintain a uniform scaled system of numbering addresses. This addressing system shall be used in designating addresses for new and existing structures and to resolve address problems which tend to confuse the traveling public or tend to delay the response of emergency services, mail delivery and other service providers. Baselines and the point of origin shall be defined in the GISOP to include the numbering structure for Jackson County. Addressing shall conform to the GISOP; however, the Jackson County GIS Department reserves the right to amend as needed.

Unit designators for these facilities shall not be less than four inches. In all cases, a number larger than the minimum size may be required where the minimum size does not provide adequate identification from the traveled roadway or is proportional to the building size. 
                  (1)  All dwellings and individual businesses shall be required to have numerical postings at the entrance or driveway of the property that is easily identifiable without obstruction of view. 
                  (2)  Any dwelling or individual business that is accessed via a common driveway with any other residential or commercial structure and located at more than 50 feet from the roadway and/or not clearly visible shall be required to have numerical posting at both the entrance or driveway and located in close proximity to the front door or entrance way.

                  (1)  Billing. Sewer charges may be billed with water charges, and failure to pay sewer charges shall be treated in the same manner as for failure to pay water charges. 
                  (2)  Industrial user surcharge. The city shall levy a BOD 5 surcharge for industrial users whose BOD 5 concentrations exceed a certain minimum value called the surcharge concentration. The surcharge will be levied up to a maximum concentration, which is the local limit. Beyond the local limit, escalating levels of enforcement action will be pursued by the city. The surcharge concentration for BOD 5 is 300 mg/l and the local limit is 900 mg/l. The current surcharge amount and the surcharge basis may be found in the fee schedule on file with the city. The city reserves the right to revise the surcharge concentration for BOD 5 and the surcharge rate by providing a 30-day notice to the industrial users. 
                  (3)  Suspension of service or discharge permit; failure to pay charges. The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or significant interference with the sewerage system. Sewer charges shall be billed with water charges, and failure to pay sewer charges shall be treated in the same manner as for failure to pay water charges as defined herein. The city reserves the right to terminate water and wastewater disposal services and disconnect a customer from the system when the customer fails to pay for sanitary sewer service when due. 
                  (4)  Termination and disconnection of service. The city reserves the right to terminate wastewater disposal services and disconnect a customer from the system when: 
                  a.  A government agency informs the city that the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant is no longer of a quality permitted for discharge into a watercourse, or it is determined that the customer is discharging wastewater into the public sewer that cannot be sufficiently treated or requires treatment that is not provided by the city as normal domestic treatment; or 
                  b.  The customer: 
                  1.  Discharges industrial waste or wastewater that is in violation of the permit issued by the city. 
                  2.  Discharges wastewater at an uncontrolled, variable rate in sufficient quantity to cause an imbalance in the wastewater treatment process. 
                  3.  Fails to pay monthly bills for sanitary sewer service when due. 
                  4.  Repeats a discharge of prohibited wastes into public sewers. 
                  (Ord. of 12-9-2013, att. A(21-105))

                  (e)  Duration and renewal of permit. Wastewater discharge permits are to be issued for a three-year period. The user must reapply for permit renewal a minimum of 90 days prior to permit expiration. The city retains the right to modify allowable discharge limits for specific pollutants if federal or state standards are changed in the interim, or for other just cause. 
                  (f)  Contents of permit. 
                  (1)  A wastewater discharge permit will specify the user's responsibilities, which shall be required of the user. Failure of the user to comply with the permit requirements will result in penalties and/or discontinuance of sewer service. Permits must contain the following information: 
                  a.  Statement of permit duration (no more than three years). 
                  b.  Statement of non-transferability without, at a minimum, prior notification to the POTW and provision of a copy of the existing control mechanism to the new owner or operator. 
                  c.  Effluent limits based on applicable general pretreatment standards, categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and state and local law. 
                  d.  Self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification, and recordkeeping requirements. 
                  e.  Statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any applicable compliance schedule. 
                  (2)  In addition, the permit may also contain the following information: 
                  a.  The unit charge or schedule of the user's charges and fees for the wastewater to be discharged to a community sewer. 
                  b.  Limits on the average and maximum wastewater constituents and characteristics. 
                  c.  Limits on average and maximum rate and time of discharge or requirements for flow regulation and equalization.

                  e.  Specifications for monitoring programs, which may include sampling locations, frequency of sampling, number, types, and standards for tests and reporting schedule. 
                  f.  Requirements for submission of technical reports or discharge reports. 
                  g.  Requirements for maintaining and retaining plant records relating to wastewater discharge as specified by the city, and affording the city access thereto. 
                  h.  Requirements for notification of the city of any new introduction of wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character of the wastewater constituent being introduced into the wastewater treatment system. 
                  i.  Requirements for notification of slug discharges. 
                  j.  Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the city to ensure compliance with this chapter. 
                  (g)  Transfer of permit. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, a new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation without prior notification (at a minimum) to the POTW and provision of a copy of the existing control mechanism to the new owner or operator. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing permit. 
                  (h)  Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations and limits set by the city as stated in their permit. Any facilities required to pre-treat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. The city in no way shall be responsible for the design operation of the plant; the review is intended only to ensure compatibility of the pretreatment system with the wastewater system. 
                  (i)  Publication of list of users in significant noncompliance. The city may annually publish in the local newspaper a list of the users which are in significant noncompliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the 12 previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the users during the same 12 months. 
                  (j)  Report of discharges; sampling; recordkeeping. 
                  (1)  Reporting requirements. The user will be required to submit to the city engineer reports indicating the nature and concentration of effluents on a periodic basis. Specific reporting requirements will be indicated in the user's permit. 
                  (2)  Analytical techniques. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and procedures approved by the EPA. 
                  (3)  Sample collection. 
                  a.  The user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. If flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the city engineer may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
                  b.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
                  (4)  Timing of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
                  (5)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city. 
                  (k)  Compliance with federal pretreatment limits. No industry will exceed the pretreatment limits as established by the EPA in accordance with section 307(b) and (c) of the Act (33 USC 1347) which apply to a specific category of industrial users. 
                  (l)  Dilution of discharge. No user shall increase the use of water or in any way dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The city may impose mass limitations on industrial users where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
                  (m)  Reports of changed conditions. 
                  (1)  Each user must notify the city engineer of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater, at least 90 days before the change. 
                  (2)  The city engineer may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application. 
                  (3)  The city engineer may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
                  (4)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
                  (n)  Confidentiality of information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections, shall be available without restriction unless the user contends such information and data constitute a trade secret, in which case the information may be withheld from the general public. The effluent data will never be considered as confidential information. Information accepted by the city as confidential, and portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes, shall be transmitted to a government agency when required to document compliance with the pretreatment program. In matters of judicial review or enforcement proceedings against an industrial user, the city shall provide all available information pertaining to that industry to the government agency. 
                  (o)  Monitoring facilities. The city shall require to be provided and operated, at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of all building sewers before they leave the property. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
                  (p)  Effect of new federal categorical pretreatment standards; modification of federal pretreatment standards. 
                  (1)  Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. 
                  (2)  Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the state for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. For purposes of this subsection, the term "consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system and 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in section 403.7(c)(2) or 40 CFR 403, "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution," promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. 
                  (q)  Compliance with federal categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (1)  The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR 405 through 471 are hereby incorporated. 
                  (2)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the city engineer may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
                  (3)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the city engineer shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
                  (4)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by the EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
                  (5)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
                  (r)  Baseline monitoring reports. 
                  (1)  Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the city engineer a report which contains the information listed in subsection (r)(2) of this section. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the city engineer a report which contains the information listed in subsection (r)(2) of this section. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
                  (2)  Users described in subsection (r)(1) of this section shall submit the following information: 
                  a.  The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner. 
                  b.  A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
                  c.  A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operations carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of water use and discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
                  d.  Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily water use and wastewater discharges, in gallons per day, to the POTW from all process streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
                  e.  Measurement of pollutants. The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process.

                  (d)  Any person who shall encroach upon any street, alley, or sidewalk in any manner whatsoever, except as herein allowed, shall, after notice from the marshal, remove the same instantly and, upon failure to do so, said encroachment or obstruction shall be removed by the marshal at the expense of the party so offending. 
                  (e)  All owners or occupants of real property shall put and keep in order the sidewalks along the margins of their improved lots and, on failure to do so after notice given, the same shall be done by the marshal under the direction of the city council at the owner's expense.

                  (p)  Any person, corporation, partnership, or firm that shall fail to comply with or shall violate any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined according to the penalties described in the general provisions chapter of this Code. 
                  (q)  No trees on any street within the city limits will be removed without permission from the city. Trees authorized to be removed will be replaced, in accordance with subsection (r) of this section.

Type (species) of trees and planting location will be determined by the city beautification committee. Should the planting season, at the time of removing such old trees, not be conducive to planting new ones, the person or business responsible for having these trees removed will pay the city the purchase price of such trees as are required for replacements. Such monies will be deposited by the city into a special beautification fund to be used by the beautification committee as it recommends. 
                  (s)  It shall be unlawful for any person, distributing or causing to be distributed, circulars, handbills, papers, or other printed advertising matter through the city, to throw into or place in any yard, dwelling, or place of business more than one of the circulars, handbills, papers, or printed advertising matter which such person may be distributing.

                  (u)  No person other than the owner or driver thereof shall deposit any advertising matter in any motor vehicle or stick or otherwise fasten any advertising matter on any part of any motor vehicle.

The request shall designate the boundaries for a special tax district which shall serve the property owner presenting the request and other property owners within the geographical area. The request shall include a plat showing the proposed special tax district. The office of the city administrator shall then provide a petition to be circulated by the presenter of the request among the property owners in the proposed district. Owners of at least 75 percent of the property within the proposed district must sign the petition for the petition to be presented to the city council. If the proposed special tax district encompasses more than one subdivision as shown by plats filed in the public land records of the county, owners of 75 percent of the property within the special tax district in each and all of the included subdivisions must sign the petition. Unless owners of 100 percent of the property have signed the petition, a public hearing shall be held by the city council after having advertised one time in the official legal organ of the county, and a sign shall be posted in the proposed special tax district giving notice of the hearing at least ten days before the public hearing. 
                  (b)  The petition for the creation of the proposed special tax district must be returned to the city administrator within 90 days of the presentment of the request. The applicant shall utilize Form No. 4-8-2013 on file with the city administrator. The city administrator shall verify the signatures on the petition and that the requisite number of property owners has signed said petition. Said petition must be accompanied by a certificate of title or other document that shows the public's interest in the right-of-way of a road or easements for construction and maintenance of infrastructure or a necessary letter of commitment from the owner to convey the road or necessary easements to the city any payment pursuant to this Code. 
                  (c)  By signing the petition for the creation of a new special tax district, all petitioners within a proposed special tax district shall be deemed to have actual or constructive notice of this article and all the provisions contained herein, as well as the request and petition for a special tax district. 
                  (d)  All successors in interest to the property owners within a certain district at the time of the creation of said special tax district shall be deemed to have constructive notice of this article and the existing special tax district or request wherein the property is located due to the existence of public records containing such information. 
                  (e)  Upon receipt of a petition as provided herein and after a public hearing, if one is required, the city council shall take under consideration the establishment of the requested special tax district. The city council, in its sole discretion, may vote to create one or more of such districts based upon all of the evidence presented to the city council. Nothing contained herein shall create any right by any property owner to the creation of such districts. The creation of one or more of such districts shall not generate a precedent or obligation on the city council to approve future requests for a special tax district; rather, each proposed district shall be considered based on the totality of the evidence regarding each respective district. The decision of the city council, in the exercise of their discretion, shall be final. 
                  (f)  The decision of the city council to create special tax districts shall be evidenced by resolutions adopted at a regular or special meeting of the city council. 
                  (g)  At the time of petition, no parcels in a proposed special tax district may be exempt or owned by entities entitled to a real property tax exemption. If after the establishment of a special tax district the greater of 50 acres or ten percent of the total acreage of the district shall become exempt, the special tax district shall be dissolved. In making this determination, the areas of roads, sidewalks, trailways, utility easements, and parcels on which there are water or wastewater treatment or municipal facilities owned by the city shall not be considered. 
                  (h)  Any special tax district established hereunder shall be dissolved 20 years from the date established. 
                  (i)  The taxes levied in any special tax district shall not exceed an additional three mills above the millage rate levied on properties outside of the district and not within any other special tax district. 
                  (j)  No property may be included in a special tax district if property taxes are outstanding or on which any tax liens exist. 
                  (k)  Additional property may be added to an existing special tax district under the same process and requirement for creation of the special tax district. 
                  (Ord. of 4-8-2013, § 41-108) 
                  Sec. 42-185. - Payments. 
                  The resolution adopted by the city council establishing a special tax district may provide that beginning in the first, second or third year, and continuing for a period of 14 years, the city shall pay up to 75 percent of the ad valorem property taxes collected in the special tax district to allow recoupment of the cost of infrastructure dedicated to the city which lies within easements or rights-of-way dedicated to the city. In the petition, the petitioner shall set forth whether the recoupment period shall begin in the first, second or third year. The petitioner or his successors in interest shall certify to the city in writing under oath, the cost of such infrastructure and the fact of dedication. So long as costs of dedicated infrastructure remain unreimbursed, the petitioner or his successors may seek recoupment during the entire 14-year period. The petitioner shall submit his recoupment application on a form provided by the city. The remaining funds collected shall be used for infrastructure or services provided by the city in the area of the special tax district.

                  If any provision of this article is in conflict with any state or federal law, or with any rule, regulation, or any order of any agency of the state or federal agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter of this article, it is hereby deemed to the intention of the city council that the state or federal law or rule, regulation, or order shall prevail such that the remaining portion of this article shall be deemed to be of full force or effect.
