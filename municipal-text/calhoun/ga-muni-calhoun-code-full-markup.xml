PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Calhoun, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1988 Code, as supplemented through May 10, 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1988 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
This 2011 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ord. No. 905, adopted December 19, 2011, and was accomplished under the supervision of Howard George, Editor. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Brad Christy, Code Attorney, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Cathy Harrison for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Section 2: All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before December 19, 2011, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. The City of Calhoun Zoning Ordinance Number 732, adopted August 13, 2001, as amended, shall neither be changed nor amended by this enacting ordinance.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall continue or occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
Section 5: Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the city council to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
Section 6: Ordinances adopted after December 19, 2011, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
Section 7: This ordinance shall become effective this 23rd day of January, 2012. 
Passed and adopted this 23rd day of January, 2012. 

 
SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this City of Calhoun, Georgia Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the code's historical evolution.

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Printed in this part is the city charter, being 1983 Ga. Laws (Act No. 569), page 4710. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-32-1, the term "recorder's court" has been changed to "municipal court." 

                  ARTICLE I. - INCORPORATION, POWERS, BOUNDARIES

                  (c)  No enumeration of particular powers in this charter shall be held to be exclusive of others, nor restrictive of general words and phrases granting powers, but shall be held to be in addition to such powers unless expressly prohibited to municipalities under the constitution or applicable laws of the State of Georgia. 
                  Sec. 1-103. - Specific powers; certain powers enumerated. 
                  (A)  The city may acquire, construct, and maintain, by condemnation or otherwise, inside or outside the city limits, public ways, streets, sidewalks, parks, public grounds, cemeteries, public buildings, libraries, sanitary landfill, sewers, drains, sewage treatment or waterworks systems, electrical or gas systems, airports, hospitals, and charitable, educational, flood control, recreational, sport, curative, corrective, detentional, penal, and medical institutions, areas, and facilities, and any other public improvement. The city, by ordinance, may establish and enforce rules and regulations necessary to preserve order, peace, and dignity on any property or facilities so acquired inside or outside the corporate limits of the city.

                  (2)  Assessments may be made on the basis of: 
                  (a)  The frontage abutting on the project, at an equal rate per foot of frontage; 
                  (b)  The area of land served or subject to being served by the project, at an equal rate per unit of area; 
                  (c)  The value added to the land served by the project or subject to being served by it, being the difference between the appraised value of the land without improvements as shown on the tax records of the county and the appraised value of the land with improvements according to the appraisal standards and rules adopted by the county at its last revaluation, at an equal rate per dollar of value added; 
                  (d)  The number of lots served or subject to being served, where the project involves extension of an existing system to a residential or commercial subdivision, at an equal rate per lot; or 
                  (e)  A combination of two or more of these bases. 
                  Whenever the basis selected for assessment is either area or value added, the mayor and council may provide for the laying out of benefit zones according to the distance of benefited property from the project being undertaken and may establish differing rates of assessment to apply uniformly throughout each benefit zone. 
                  For each project, the mayor and council shall endeavor to establish an assessment method from among the bases set out in this section which will most accurately assess each lot or parcel of land according to the benefit conferred upon it by the project. The mayor and council's decision as to the method of assessment shall be final and conclusive and not subject to further review or challenge. 
                  (3)  The procedures for execution of the power and authority granted herein, including payment of assessments, liens for assessments against property, and the issuance, levy, and collection of executions, shall be as prescribed by ordinance or resolution of the mayor and council. 
                  (C)  (1)  The mayor and council are empowered and authorized, if they so desire, to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of any or all electric, water or other municipally owned public utility, plant or property, on such terms and conditions as the mayor and council deem proper, and to transfer title to such public utility properties by warranty deed, bill of sale, contract or lease, in the manner provided by law. 
                  (2)  Notice of intention to make such sale, lease or other disposition of the waterworks, electric system and plant or other municipally owned public utility, setting out the price and other general terms and conditions of the proposed sale, lease or disposition, shall be given by publication once a week for three consecutive weeks in The Calhoun Times. After ten days from the last publication of such notice, the plant may be disposed of unless, within ten days after the last publication of the notice, a petition signed by not less than 20 percent of the qualified voters of the City of Calhoun is filed with the City Clerk, objecting to and protesting against the sale, lease or disposition. If the petition, so signed, is filed, the sale shall not be made unless submitted to a special election ordered for the purpose of determining whether a majority, which shall constitute two-thirds of those voting at the election, favors the sale, lease or other disposition. Such election shall be ordered by the mayor and council to be held not less than 50 days after the date of the filing of the objecting petition with the City subject only to the provisions establishing the dates upon which special elections may be held as set out in O.C.G.A. § 21-3-52, as amended. The election shall be held in accordance with and in all respects be governed by the Acts of the General Assembly in regard to elections to determine whether municipalities shall issue bonds or not. The notice of the election shall state its purpose. 
                  (3)  The ballots provided for the election shall have plainly written or printed thereon the words "Shall the waterworks, electric or public utility (as the case may be), be sold, leased, or disposed of (as the case may be)?" Beside such words shall be suitably placed, on separate lines, the words "Yes" and "No," so that the voter may indicate the way he desires to vote on the question submitted. 
                  (4)  If two-thirds of those voting in the election vote in favor of such sale, lease or disposition, the mayor and council may proceed to sell, lease or dispose of such plant in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the notice of proposed intention to sell, lease or dispose of such plant. If such election is determined against the sale, lease or disposition of the plant, the plant shall not be sold, leased or disposed of but shall remain the property of the City. 
                  (D)  Where authorized by the general laws of the State of Georgia, the mayor and council of the city shall have the right to make contracts with persons, firms or corporations residing beyond the City limits to furnish them with electricity or sewage disposal and water, or either, whenever the same can be done without interfering with the efficient supply of electricity and water to the inhabitants of the city. 
                  (E)  (1)  The mayor and council shall have the power to cause the owner or owners of lots within the city to drain the same or to fill the same to the level of the streets or alleys on which said lots abut, to cause the owner or owners of cellars holding water to cause the same to be drained thereof or filled up if necessary, to compel property owners to make proper connections of drain pipes to storm sewers and gutters or other street waterways, and to pass such ordinances regulating the same as they may deem necessary. 
                  (2)  Whenever the owner of any such property shall refuse or fail, after a reasonable notice to him or his agent or to the tenant in possession of said premises, to comply with the requirements of said mayor and council within the period prescribed for such notice, it shall be lawful for the city to cause the same to be done at the owner's expense. For the amount so expended, the city clerk shall issue an execution against the owner to be collected from the property belonging to him, and a sale under the execution by the city clerk shall pass title to the property as fully and completely as a sale by the sheriff under judgment and execution. 
                  (F)  The mayor and council of the city shall have power to organize one or more work gangs and confine therein persons who have been sentenced by the municipal court of the City of Calhoun to work upon the streets or public works of the city, to make rules and regulations that may be suitable or necessary for the care, management, or control of such work gang, and to enforce such rules and regulations through their proper officer. 
                  (G)  The mayor and council shall have power and authority to remove or cause to be removed all buildings, porches, steps, fences, or other obstructions or nuisances in public streets, lanes, alleys, sidewalks, squares, parks, or other public ways in the city; to fill up all open cellars or excavations in the city or cause the owners to do so; and to condemn and remove, or cause to be removed, all dilapidated or unsafe structures which they may consider a nuisance or dangerous to the health or lives of the people of the city. 
                  (H)  The mayor and council shall have the power and authority to allocate up to $2,000.00 per fiscal year as a charitable donation to Big Brothers/Big Sisters. 
                  (I)  Telecommunications. The City shall have the power and authority to acquire, own, hold, lease, sell, resell, build, maintain, operate and contract with respect to a telecommunications systems network in order to provide telecommunications services and similar other services, including cable television services (CATV), to establish and charge rates, fees, tolls and charges for the services, facilities or commodities furnished or made available by such undertaking; to interconnect its system or services or both with the systems or services of consumers and other providers, to use telecommunications to respond to community needs, encourage the development of information-based organizations in the City of Calhoun, Georgia, to finance from time to time any such telecommunications systems through the issuance of revenue bonds as then permitted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia; and to make any contract with respect to and furnish the services of any said systems to consumers within or outside the corporate limits of the City.

                  Sec. 1-105. - Boundaries; official map. 
                  The corporate boundaries of the city shall be the same as those of the City of Calhoun as provided by law and existing immediately prior to the effective date of this charter or as hereafter lawfully changed. The clerk of council shall maintain a current map and written legal description indicating the boundaries of the city. Photographic, typed, or other copies of the map or description certified by the clerk of council shall be admitted as evidence in all courts and shall have the same force and effect as with the original map or description.

                  This chapter has been enacted for the purpose of promoting the health and general welfare of the city, establishing reasonable and ascertainable standards for the regulation and control of the licensing and sale of alcoholic beverages, protecting and preserving schools and churches, giving effect to existing land use, and preserving residential areas with reasonable consideration being given to the character of the area and its peculiar suitability for particular uses and the congestion in roads and streets, and with a general view of promoting desirable living conditions, sustaining the stability of neighborhoods and property values, protecting against the evils of concentration of retail licenses for alcoholic beverages in one family or corporation, and preventing an undesirable person from engaging or having an interest in alcoholic beverages or the sale thereof in the city, considering the proximity to the proposed location of other establishments selling alcoholic beverages, considering adequate parking availability, and considering the feelings and attitudes of citizens residing in the area adjacent to the proposed location of the premises for which an application for a permit to sell alcoholic beverages has been made.

                  (2)  For a person under 21 years of age to purchase or knowingly possess any alcoholic beverage; 
                  (3)  For a person under 21 years of age to misrepresent such person's age in any manner whatever for the purpose of obtaining illegally any alcoholic beverage; 
                  (4)  For a person knowingly or intentionally to act as an agent to purchase or acquire any alcoholic beverage for or on behalf of a person under 21 years of age; or

                  (b)  The prohibitions contained in subsections (a)(1), (2) and (4) of this section shall not apply with respect to the sale, purchase or possession of alcoholic beverages for consumption:

                  (2)  At a religious ceremony. 
                  (c)  The prohibitions contained in subsections (a)(1), (2) and (4) of this section shall not apply with respect to the possession of alcoholic beverages for consumption by a person under 21 years of age when the parent or guardian of the person under 21 years of age gives the alcoholic beverage to the person and when possession is in the home of the parent or guardian and such parent or guardian is present. 
                  (d)  The prohibition contained in subsection (a)(1) of this section shall not apply with respect to sale of alcoholic beverages by a person when such person has been furnished with proper identification showing that the person to whom the alcoholic beverage is sold is 21 years of age or older. For purposes of this subsection, the term "proper identification" means any document issued by a governmental agency containing a description of the person, such person's photograph, or both, and giving such person's date of birth, and includes, without being limited to, a passport, a military identification card, a driver's license, or an identification card authorized under O.C.G.A. §§ 40-5-100—40-5-104, pertaining to proper identification, shall not include a birth certificate and shall not include any traffic citation or complaint form. 
                  (e)  If such conduct is not otherwise prohibited pursuant to this chapter, nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit any person under 21 years of age from:

                  (2)  Being employed in any establishment in which alcoholic beverages are distilled or manufactured; or

Failure to make such request and verification in any case where the person to whom the alcoholic beverage is sold or otherwise furnished is less than 21 years of age may be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether the person selling or otherwise furnishing such alcoholic beverage did so knowingly. 
                  (g)  Any person who is charged and then convicted for the first time only in the municipal court for the city of violating any prohibition contained in subsection (a) of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished in accordance with section 1-7, except that any person convicted of violating subsection (a)(2) of this section shall, upon the first conviction only, be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by not more than 30 days' imprisonment or a fine of not more than $300.00 or both.

                  (i)  Unless the officer has reasonable cause to believe such person is intoxicated, a law enforcement officer may arrest by issuance of a citation a person accused of violating only subsection (a)(2) of this section. The citation shall enumerate the specific charges against the person and either the date upon which the person is to appear and answer the charges or a notation that the person will be later notified of the date upon which the person is to appear and answer the charges. If the person charged shall fail to appear as required, the judge having jurisdiction of the offense may issue a warrant or other order directing the apprehension of such person and commanding that he be brought before the court to answer the charges contained within the citation and the charge of his failure to appear as required. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to invalidate an otherwise valid arrest by citation of a person who is intoxicated.

                  Sec. 6-171. - Tax levied. 
                  (a)  In addition to all other taxes or license fees heretofore or hereafter imposed upon all alcoholic beverage licensees engaged in the city in the business of selling alcoholic beverages, there is hereby imposed and levied upon all such dealers and licensees within the city an excise tax, to be computed and collected as set forth in this article. 
                  (b)  The excise tax levied under this section shall be the maximum amount permitted by state law, such amount presently being the amount prescribed by the mayor and council based upon volume as the tax pertains to malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits and by the drink as the tax pertains to distilled spirits. A schedule of such excise tax is maintained on file with the city administrator. 
                  (Code 1988, §§ 3-32, 3-56, 3-152; Ord. No. 656, § 7, 11-23-1998)

                  Sec. 6-172. - Collection by wholesale dealers. 
                  (a)  Duties of wholesale dealers; collection and remittance to city. The excise tax imposed by this article shall be computed and payable monthly. Each wholesale dealer selling, shipping or delivering alcoholic beverages by the package to any alcoholic beverage licensee in the city shall, as a condition of the privilege of conducting such business in the city, be subject to the following: 
                  (1)  Each wholesaler shall keep and maintain true and correct records of all sales, shipments or deliveries of alcoholic beverages by the package to each licensee in the city, such records to be preserved for a period of not less than one year and to be made available on request for inspection by any duly authorized representative of the city. 
                  (2)  Each wholesaler shall collect from each licensee in the city, at time of delivery of alcoholic beverages, the amount of tax due under the terms of this article and hold such amount in trust for the city until such tax is remitted to the city as provided in this article. 
                  (3)  On or before the tenth day of each calendar month, each wholesaler shall make a verified and comprehensive report to the city, which shall correctly show and reflect all sales and deliveries of alcoholic beverages to or for licensees in the city for the calendar month immediately preceding the date of the report. The report shall show the name and address of each licensee, the quantities delivered to each licensee, the amount of excise tax collected under the terms of this section, and such other reasonable information as may be requested by the city. The report shall be accompanied by remittance payable to the city for all taxes collected or due, as shown on the report. 
                  (4)  The excise tax levied in this section is hereby levied upon the retailer licensed to do business in the city and it is the intent of this chapter to so levy this tax, but require the payment of the tax at the time of delivery by the retailer to the wholesaler, who shall have the responsibility of remitting the tax to the city on behalf of the retailer on or before the tenth day of each calendar month, as required in this section. If the tax due under this section is not paid on or before the tenth day of each calendar month, a ten percent penalty on the gross tax will be levied by the city against each defaulting retailing licensee for whom the tax is not paid on or before the tenth day of the month. 
                  (b)  Noncompliance by wholesale dealer or distributor. If any wholesale dealer or distributor fails or refuses to make the reports required in this section, the city shall notify such dealer or distributor in writing. If the reports are not made and the taxes remitted within five days from the date of such notice, such wholesale dealer or distributor shall be prohibited from making any further deliveries in the city and the retail licensees served by such wholesale dealer or distributor for whom the taxes have not been paid shall be subject to having their license suspended or revoked as provided in this chapter. 
                  (c)  Unlawful retail sales. It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person to sell at retail within the city any alcoholic beverage on which the taxes provided for in this article have not been paid. 
                  (d)  Unlawful deliveries. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter for any wholesale dealer or distributor, or other person, to deliver any alcoholic beverage to any retail dealer in the city without collecting, at the time of such delivery, the excise taxes provided for in this article. 
                  (e)  Penalties. Any person violating any of the provisions of this article, or who shall assist any retail dealer in alcoholic beverages in the city to evade or avoid the payment of the taxes provided for in this article, shall be guilty of a violation of this section, and on conviction thereof in the municipal court shall be fined or sentenced as provided by section 1-7. Any such person so convicted shall also be subject to having such person's license suspended or revoked, if such person shall be a licensed dealer in alcoholic beverages.

                  Sec. 6-173. - Tax on sales by the drink. 
                  (a)  Every purchaser of distilled spirits or alcoholic beverages for beverage purposes by the drink at retail in the city shall be liable for a tax thereon at the rate of three percent of the sale price or charge for such beverages. Such tax shall be paid by the purchaser to the licensee making such sales, as provided in this section. The licensee shall remit the tax to the city administrator on or before the tenth day of the succeeding month, to be delinquent if remitted thereafter, with a summary of the licensee's gross sales derived from the sale of distilled spirits or alcoholic beverages for beverage purposes by the drink and the amount of taxes collected by him from his purchasers, on such form as may be required by the city administrator. When received by the city administrator, it shall be a credit against the tax imposed under this article on the licensee. Every licensee making sales of such beverages shall be liable for a tax thereon at the rate of three percent of such gross sales or gross sales derived from the sale of distilled spirits or alcoholic beverages for beverage purposes by the drink or the amount of taxes collected by him from his purchasers, as provided in this section, whichever is greater. 
                  (b)  Gross sales shall include all credit sales to the extent permitted by the laws of the state, and shall be reported and the taxes collected thereon remitted to the city administrator to the same extent as required of cash sales. The fact that the licensee may receive payment from such credit sales in a later reporting period shall not relieve or excuse the licensee's responsibility for collecting and remitting the tax as provided under this section. 
                  (c)  The tax so levied is, and shall be, in addition to all other taxes, whether levied in the form of excise, license or privilege taxes, and shall be in addition to all other fees and taxes levied. 
                  (d)  The taxes imposed in this section are upon the purchaser and shall be collected by the licensee from the purchaser. Therefore, the licensee shall collect the tax imposed under this section from the purchaser and shall pay the tax over to the city as provided in this section. 
                  (e)  The licensee shall, as far as practicable, add the amount of the tax imposed under this section to the sale price or charge, which shall be a debt from the purchaser to the licensee until paid, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts. Any licensee who shall neglect, fail, or refuse to collect the tax provided for in this section upon any, every and all retail sales made by him or his agents or employees of alcoholic beverages which are subject to the tax imposed under this section shall be liable for and pay the tax himself. 
                  (f)  A licensee shall not advertise or hold out to the public, in any manner, directly or indirectly, that he will absorb all or any part of the tax, or that he will relieve the purchaser of the payment of all or any of the tax. 
                  (g)  If any licensee liable for any tax levied under this section shall sell out his business or stock of goods, or shall quit the business, he shall make a final return and payment with 15 days after the date of selling or quitting the business. 
                  (h)  In reporting and paying the amount of tax due under this section, each licensee shall be allowed a deduction equal to that rate authorized for deductions from state tax under O.C.G.A. Art. 1, Ch. 8, T. 48 (O.C.G.A. § 48-8-1 et seq.), provided that the tax due is not delinquent at time of payment. 
                  (i)  The tax imposed under this section shall, for each month, become delinquent on the 15th day of each succeeding month. The city administrator is empowered and it shall be his duty, when any tax becomes delinquent under this section, to pursue any remedy or right allowed by law for the enforcement of the collection and payment of taxes lawfully levied by the city as may be allowed under the laws of the state and the ordinances of the city. 
                  (j)  Any default or delinquency of the tax levied under this section shall constitute cause for suspension or revocation of alcoholic beverage licenses. 
                  (k)  When the governing authority determines that a licensee has been chronically delinquent or chronically in default under this section, the governing authority, when acting upon the application of such licensee for renewal of his license may, in the exercise of its discretion, deny such application upon the grounds of such chronic delinquency. 
                  (l)  Any licensee who fails to pay the tax imposed in this section to the city, or fails to pay any amount of such tax required to be collected and paid to the city within the time required, shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the tax, in addition to the tax or amount of the tax, plus interest on the unpaid tax or any portion thereof at a rate of one percent per month from the 15th day of the month following the monthly period for which the amount or any portion thereof should have been returned, until date of payment.

                  Sec. 10-31. - Findings; public purpose. 
                  (a)  Based on the experiences of other municipalities and local governments, and on the experiences of the city, which experiences we believe are relevant to the problem faced by the city, we take note of the conditions and occurrences generally associated with adult entertainment establishments, whether or not alcoholic beverages are served, result in an increase in criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions. An increase in instances of disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, prostitution, drug trafficking and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other municipalities and local governments which permit adult entertainment establishments, regardless of the serving of alcoholic beverages. 
                  (b)  The mayor and council, as well as city staff and the city attorney, have read and studied the American Planning Association guide entitled Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Regulating Sex Businesses, authored by Eric Damien Kelly and Connie B. Cooper, published in December 2000. Additionally, the mayor and council received an oral report from the chief of police at its meeting on November 24, 2008, wherein he outlined that during his nearly 40 years in military and civilian law enforcement he has personally observed the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses on the community to include increased crime rates, depreciation in property values, and deterioration of community character and quality of life in or near adult entertainment businesses. The guide reviewed by the mayor and council in reaching the findings contained herein is being attached to the minutes of the meeting approving the ordinance from which this article is derived, and is officially made a part of the record. The mayor and council also recognize that courts have made findings in these issues, and rely on the collective wisdom and common sense of each member of this governing authority. We further rely upon the evidentiary foundation set forth in the court decisions reported in the above noted guide and in such cases as Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), 106 S. Ct. 925, to the effect that negative secondary effects are caused by the presence of even one adult entertainment establishment in a given neighborhood. 
                  (c)  An increase in instances of disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, public indecency, public solicitation, violent crime, prostitution, exploitation of young women, drug use, drug trafficking and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other municipalities and local governments that permit adult entertainment establishments, particularly where there are two or more such businesses in close proximity, and particularly in such businesses that serve alcohol. The mayor and council have a substantial interest in guarding against these undesirable secondary effects, to protect the public health, safety and welfare and to preserve and protect the quality of life in the city. The mayor and council also wish to guard against public indecency, which is a crime per O.C.G.A. § 16-6-8, and to guard against certain sexual contact provided for money, which is a crime per O.C.G.A. § 16-6-16. 
                  (d)  The mayor and council also find that the increase in criminal behavior which accompanies adult entertainment establishments causes undesirable community conditions, particularly where there are two or more such businesses in close proximity, and particularly in such businesses that serve alcohol. Conditions experienced in other municipalities and local governments are: depression of property values in neighborhoods surrounding the adult entertainment establishment, neighborhood blight, an increased burden on and expenditure for law enforcement, and an increase in the criminal case load in the judicial system due to a greater number of arrests because of the above mentioned crime problems. The mayor and council note a substantial governmental interest in regulating this and any atmosphere conducive to violence, sexual harassment, public intoxication, prostitution, spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other negative effects. The mayor and council wish to protect against neighborhood blight and downgrade of surrounding neighborhoods due to the problems and undesirable behavior associated with adult entertainment establishments. 
                  (e)  The mayor and council find that the above-stated undesirable secondary effects will harm the city unless these regulations are imposed to limit such adverse affects. These regulations are to minimize the adverse effects in order to preserve quality of life and to protect the public health, safety, welfare and morals and to maintain the integrity of this community, especially in residential areas, and areas which have a church, school, daycare center, governmental building, library, civil center, public park or playground. These regulations are to promote these legitimate public and governmental interests in a way that will not infringe upon the constitutional right of freedom of expression. The mayor and council are not attempting to preclude adult entertainment; rather, we seek to regulate adult entertainment establishments to protect the public from the above-described, negative secondary effects. The mayor and council have narrowly tailored these regulations to combat the negative secondary effects and protect the public health, safety and welfare, while allowing reasonable avenues of protected first amendment communication. The mayor and council have found no less-restrictive alternative to these regulations that would adequately protect the public health, safety and welfare. The restrictions posed by these regulations are no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the government interest stated above. 
                  (f)  Therefore, the purpose of this article is to regulate adult entertainment establishments to prevent increases in criminal activity and undesirable community conditions. It is recognized that such regulation cannot approach prohibition, or a protected form of expression would vanish. Therefore, this article represents an attempt to balance the competing interests of reduced criminal activity and neighborhood protection versus the rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

The occupation tax only applies to those businesses and occupations which are covered by the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-13-5—48-13-26. All other applicable businesses and occupations are taxed by the local government pursuant to the pertinent general and/or local law and ordinances.

All contents of such return shall be confidential and open only to the officials, employees, agents or clerks of the city using such returns for the purpose of the occupation tax levy and the collection of the tax. Independent auditors or bookkeepers employed by the city shall be classed as employees. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the publication by the city officials of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and items thereof, or the inspection of the records by duly qualified employees of the tax departments of the state, the United States, and other local governments.

The lien of the occupation tax shall become fixed on and dated from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the city clerk or the clerk's duly designated officer of the city upon the property of defendant located in the jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of the execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by the ordinances and Charter of the city and the laws of the state, and the defendant in such execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the city clerk against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of taxes.

                  (b)  The city may fix a charge for all transfers of ownership of lots and grave spaces. No transfer of ownership shall be complete or effective until all charges are paid.

                  Subdivision III. - Vested Rights of Interment 

                  Sec. 26-111. - Family plots inalienable; right of interment generally; reversion of lot to city. 
                  (a)  Reversion of lot to city. Whenever an interment of the remains of a member or of a relative of a member of the family of the record owner, or of the remains of the record owner, is made in a lot transferred by deed or certificate of ownership to an individual owner and the owner dies without making disposition of the lot either in his will by a specific device or by a written declaration filed and recorded in the office of the city clerk or clerk of superior court, the lot thereby becomes inalienable and shall be held as the family lot of the owner, with title to the lot reverting to the city for protection of those who may be interred therein. 
                  (b)  Right of interment generally. In a family lot, one grave, niche or crypt may be used for the owner's interment, and one for the owner's surviving spouse, if any, who by law has a right of interment in it. In those remaining, if any, the parents and children of the deceased owner, in order of death, may be interred without the consent of any person claiming interest in the plot. 
                  (c)  Order of right of interment. If no parent or child survives, the right of interment goes in the order of death, first, to the spouse of any child of the record owner, and second, in the order of death, to the next heir at law of the owner or the spouse of any heir at law. 
                  (d)  Waiver of interment right in favor of other relative. Any surviving spouse, parent, child or heir who has a right of interment in a family plot may waive such right in favor of any other relative, or spouse of a relative, of either the deceased owner or of his spouse, and upon such waiver the remains of the person in whose favor the waiver is made may be interred in the lot. 
                  (e)  Interment right of owner's spouse. The spouse of any owner of any plot which contains more than one interment space has a vested right of interment of his remains in the lot or grave space, and any person thereafter becoming the spouse of the owner has a vested right of interment of his remains in the lot if more than one interment space is unoccupied at the time the person becomes the spouse of the owner. 
                  (f)  Termination of vested right of spouse. No conveyance or other action of the owner without the written consent or joinder of the spouse of the owner divests the spouse of a vested right of interment, except that a final decree of divorce between them terminates the vested right of interment unless otherwise provided in the decree. 
                  (Ord. No. 607A, § 1(6-17—6-22), 3-10-1997) 
                  Sec. 26-112. - Designation of representative when lot has several owners. 
                  When there are several owners of the rights of interment in a lot or space, they may designate one or more persons to represent the lot or grave space and file written notice of designation with the city. In the absence of such notice of written objection to its so doing, the city is not liable to any owner for interring or permitting any interment or refusing an interment in the lot or grave space upon the request or direction of any co-owners of the lot or grave space.

                  Sec. 26-113. - Waiver of vested right. 
                  A vested right of interment may be waived, and is so waived and terminated upon the interment elsewhere of the remains of the person in whose vested. 
                  (Ord. No. 607A, § 1(6-24), 3-10-1997) 
                  Sec. 26-114. - Limitations on scope of vested right. 
                  No vested right of interment gives to any person the right to have his remains interred in any interment space in which the remains of any deceased having prior vested right of interment have been interred, nor does it give any person the right to have the remains of more than one deceased person interred in a single interment space.

                  (b)  The 4:00 p.m. time limit applies to any portion of the interment held on cemetery grounds.

                  (b)  Only city employees will supervise the opening or closing of graves. The cemetery director reserves the right to refuse to permit opening or closing of a grave of questionable ownership, with the approval of the city administrator or director of public works. 
                  (c)  All state and local health laws must be complied with prior to any interment in any city cemetery. 
                  (d)  All interments must be inside containers of minimum standard as approved by the cemetery director (minimum standard is pine construction or equal).

                  Sec. 34-31. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Fixed asset means permanent business properties such as land, buildings, machinery, and equipment. 
                  Gap funding means the portion of funds supplied by the city through the revolving loan fund that allows a business to remain in operation, expand operations, or start up that would not take place without this financial assistance. 
                  Job means full-time employment for a period not less than 365 days. 
                  Job retained means a job that would be lost if the financial assistance from the city were not provided. The business applying for the funds must prove to the satisfaction of the loan review committee of the revolving loan fund that these funds are necessary. 
                  Loan advisory commission means citizens, who are professionals in the area of finance, appointed by the mayor and city council to review all loan applications for the revolving loan fund. 
                  Low and moderate income means income levels as published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Section 8 Assistance Program. The levels are usually calculated as 80 percent of a county's median income adjusted for family size. The most recent data for such determinations may be obtained from the state department of community affairs at (404) 656-2900. Applicants should note that jobs paying minimum wage do not necessarily qualify as low/moderate income jobs. Individual family income levels at the time of application for employment determine qualifications.

                  New job created means a job that was not in existence and represents a new budgeted position that will be filled within six months. This job must be tangible and the applicant must commit that this job will be filled after the loan from the city. 
                  Pro forma means estimation of anticipated expenditures, revenues, and cash flow for a given period of time. 
                  Start-up means the creation of a new business that was not previously in existence. 
                  Working capital means funds available and necessary for normal business operations.

                  Sec. 38-31. - Surrender of principal by surety; forfeiture of bond; death of principal. 
                  When the municipal court is not in session, a surety on a bond may surrender the surety's principal to a responsible law enforcement officer of the city in order to be released from liability. When the court is in session, a surety on a bond may surrender the surety's principal in open court and the principal shall be considered surrendered by plea of guilty or nolo contendere to the court or if the principal is present in person when the judge finds the principal guilty or if the judge dismisses the case prior to entry of judgment and, upon such plea or finding of guilty or dismissal, the surety shall be released from liability. If the principal does not appear by the end of the day on which the principal was bound to appear, the bond shall be forfeited. The death of the principal shall be equivalent to a surrender.

                  Sec. 38-32. - Time when forfeiture occurs. 
                  (a)  A bond forfeiture under this article occurs at the end of the court day upon the failure of appearance of a principal of any bond or recognizance given for the appearance of that person. 
                  (b)  An appearance bond shall not be forfeited unless the clerk of court or appropriate employee, agent, or representative for the police department gave the surety at least 72 hours' written notice, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, before the time of the required appearance of the principal. Notice shall not be necessary if the time for appearance is within 72 hours from the time of arrest, provided the time for appearance is stated on the bond, or where the principal is given actual notice in open court.

                  Sec. 38-33. - Execution hearing on failure of principal to appear. 
                  (a)  The municipal court judge shall, within ten days, upon the failure to appear, order an execution hearing not sooner than 120 days but not later than 150 days after such failure to appear. Notice of the execution hearing shall be served by certified mail to the surety at the address listed on the bond or by personal service to the surety within ten days of the date of notice or at its home office or to its designated registered agent. 
                  (b)  If at the execution hearing it is determined that judgment should be entered, the judge shall so order. 
                  (Code 1988, § 13-32) 
                  Sec. 38-34. - Conditions not warranting forfeiture of bond for failure to appear; remission of forfeiture. 
                  (a)  No judgment shall be rendered on a forfeiture of any appearance bond under this article if it is shown to the satisfaction of the court by the written and witnessed statement of a licensed physician that the principal on the bond was prevented from attending by some physical disability. 
                  (b)  No judgment shall be rendered on a forfeiture of any appearance bond if it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the principal on the bond was prevented from attending because he was detained by reason of arrest, sentence, or confinement in a penal institution or jail in the state, or because he was involuntarily confined or detained pursuant to court order in a mental institution in the state. An official written and witnessed notice of the holding institution in which the principal is being detained or confined shall be considered adequate proof of the principal's detention or confinement. Upon the presentation of such written notice to the court services officer for the municipal court and the prosecutor having jurisdiction over the case along with the payment of costs by the surety to the sheriff or other law enforcement agency necessary for the return of the principal, such notice shall serve as the surety's request for a detainer to be placed on the principal. Should there be a failure to place a detainer within 30 days, Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays included, after such presentation and payment of costs, the surety shall then be relieved of liability for the appearance bond. 
                  (c)  If the prosecution does not try the charges against a defendant within a period of one year after the date of posting bond, judgment rendered after such period may not be enforced against the surety on the bond and the surety shall thereafter be relieved of liability on the bond. This provision shall not apply where the prosecution's failure to try the charges is due to the fault of the principal. 
                  (d)  No judgment shall be rendered on a forfeiture of any appearance bond if it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the principal on the bond is in the custody of the county sheriff or other responsible law enforcement agency. An official written notice of the sheriff or other responsible law enforcement officer having custody or detention of the principal shall be considered adequate proof of such custody or detention. Presentation of such official written to the court services officer for the municipal court and the prosecutor having jurisdiction of the case along with payment of the estimated cost necessary to return the principal shall act as a request that a detainer be placed against the principal. Upon the police department assuming custody of the principal, the surety shall be relieved of the bond obligation except as provided in section 38-31. Should the city fail to place a detainer within 30 days, Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays included, and after presentation and the payment of the estimated cost necessary to return the principal, the surety shall be relieved of the bond obligation. 
                  (e)  No judgment shall be rendered on any appearance bond if it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the surety was prevented from returning the principal to the jurisdiction because such principal was on active military duty. 
                  (f)  On application filed within 90 days from the payment of judgment, the court shall order remission under the following conditions: 
                  (1)  Provided the bond amount has been paid at any time within 90 days after judgment and the delay has not prevented the proper prosecution of the principal, upon application to the court with prior notice to the prosecutor of such application, the court shall direct remission of 95 percent of the bond amount remitted to the surety if the surety locates the principal causing the return of the principal to the city, apprehends, surrenders, or produces the principal, if the apprehension or surrender of the principal was substantially procured or caused by the surety, or if the location of the principal by the surety causes the adjudication of the principal in the municipal court. Should the surety, within two years of the failure to appear, locate the principal causing the return of the principal to the municipal court, apprehend, surrender, produce, or substantially cause the apprehension or surrender of the principal, or if the location of the principal by the surety causes the adjudication of the principal in the municipal court, the surety shall be entitled to a refund of 50 percent of the bond payment; and 
                  (2)  Remission shall be granted on the condition of the payment of court costs and of the expenses of returning the principal to the city by the surety.

This procedure includes the submission for recording of the fi. fa. to the clerk of the superior court of the county for entry of judgment on the general execution docket.

Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority; 
                  (5)  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. 1-3-3, definitions, to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock, including, but not limited to, cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including, but not limited to, chickens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds; 
                  (6)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in paragraphs (15) and (16) of section 46-98(c)(15) and (16), no other land disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  (7)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  (8)  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and, for purposes of this subsection, the term "state waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them yearround; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located; and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by subsection (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) or (10) of this section; 
                  (9)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road and tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7.1; except where the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  (10)  Any land disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power, except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United states engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and

                  (Ord. No. 731, § II, 5-14-2001; Ord. No. 765, § III, 12-8-2003; Ord. No. 886, § III, 11-9-2009) 
                  Sec. 46-98. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale, unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit, and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a "disturbed area" is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented, or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this subsection, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat, and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 731, § III, 5-14-2001; Ord. No. 765, § IV, 12-8-2003; Ord. No. 886, § IV, 11-9-2009) 
                  Sec. 46-99. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the building official to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD, if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the building official and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 46-98(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by six copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-8, half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 46-98(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 46-98 (b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for a site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 46-98(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 731, § IV, 5-14-2001; Ord. No. 765, § V, 12-8-2003; Ord. No. 886, § V, 11-9-2009) 
                  Sec. 46-100. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The building official will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The building official shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The districts or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The Division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to Code section 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the Director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order; and; 
                  (3)  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 46-99(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose a penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation.

                  Sec. 46-300. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the city's watershed protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and, 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  Article IX, section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and council of the city hereby ordain this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 449, art. 1, § A, 11-12-1990; Ord. No. 877, art. 1, § A, 8-11-2008) 
                  Sec. 54-34. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 449, art. 1, § B, 11-12-1990; Ord. No. 877, art. 1, § B, 8-11-2008) 
                  Sec. 54-35. - Purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  (h)  Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (see section 54-81(6)). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a and (3)c of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-38 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. 
                  Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
                  (Ord. No. 449, art. 5, § B, 11-12-1990; Ord. No. 877, art. 4, § B, 8-11-2008) 
                  Sec. 54-83. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways (A-Zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-38, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 54-38, then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this division. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (subsections (2) and (3) of this section) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 54-81(4), Elevated buildings. 
                  (4)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (Ord. No. 449, art. 5, § C, 11-12-1990; Ord. No. 877, art. 4, § C, 8-11-2008) 
                  Sec. 54-84. - Standards for subdivisions. 
                  (a)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (b)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  (c)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
                  (d)  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the as-built data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR. 
                  (Ord. No. 449, art. 5, § D, 11-12-1990; Ord. No. 877, art. 4, § E, 8-11-2008) 
                  Sec. 54-85. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-38 may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet (3) above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 54-81(4), Elevated buildings. 
                  The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 54-64(a)(1)c and (2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  (Ord. No. 877, art. 4, § D, 8-11-2008) 
                  Sec. 54-86. - Standards for critical facilities. 
                  (a)  Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain. 
                  (b)  All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation.

               <head>Chapter 59 - HEALTH AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS </head>
               <p>
                  Sec. 59-1. - Findings. 
                  (a)  The United States Surgeon General has stated that smoking of cigarettes and the use of tobacco products is the leading cause of premature death and disability in the United States of America. Medical evidence confirms that smoking of tobacco can be hazardous to the health of the smoker and nonsmokers. Medical research has confirmed that nonsmokers with chronic heart or lung disease can experience distress when exposed to sufficient concentrations of secondhand smoke. Many allergic individuals and healthy nonsmokers report discomfort when exposed to secondhand smoke. Recent medical studies provide sufficient evidence that long-term exposure to involuntary smoking may increase a nonsmoker's risk of developing serious lung disease. 
                  (b)  The city safety committee has reviewed and has recommended the adoption of smoking prohibitions for buildings owned, leased or rented by the city, as well as vehicles owned or leased and operated by employees of the city. 
                  (c)  The mayor and council find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare and safety of the city and its citizens: 
                  (1)  To provide a healthy, comfortable and productive working environment for its employees in city public buildings and facilities serving the public, as well as in publicly owned motor vehicles; 
                  (2)  To protect nonsmokers; 
                  (3)  To assist employees in adjusting to restrictions on smoking and the use of tobacco products; 
                  (4)  To prohibit smoking of cigarettes, cigars and the use of other tobacco products in any city owned, leased or rented enclosed building space, as well as any motor vehicle or equipment owned or leased by the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 773, § 59-1, 12-8-2003) 
                  Sec. 59-2. - Prohibitions. 
                  From the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, smoking of cigarettes, cigars or the use of other tobacco products by whatever name known or called now or in the future is prohibited in any enclosed building space, as well as any motor vehicle, owned leased or rented by the city and any of its departments, agencies, boards, authorities or commissions. For purposes of this section, the term "nonsmoker" shall mean any individual who declares that he or she does not smoke cigarettes, cigars or other tobacco products or has discontinued smoking of cigarettes, cigars or other tobacco products.

                  The mayor and council is authorized and directed to promulgate and disseminate to all employees of the city the findings contained in this chapter and to provide for its implementation as follows: 
                  (1)  All departments, agencies, authorities, boards, commissions and elected officials will give this chapter wide dissemination to all employees or volunteers; 
                  (2)  All prospective new city employees will be informed of this no smoking and non-use of tobacco products chapter before they are hired; and 
                  (3)  Signs will be placed in all appropriate spaces and city buildings indicating that smoking and the use of tobacco products is not allowed, with such signs to be uniform in language and color.

                  Sec. 59-5. - Employee responsibility. 
                  All employees of the city share in the responsibility of adhering to and enforcing this chapter.

                  Sec. 59-6. - Violations and penalties. 
                  (a)  Any violation of section 59-2 or conflict concerning its implementation shall be brought to the attention of the appropriate supervisory personnel. In all cases, the right of a nonsmoker to protect his health and comfort will take precedence over an employee or nonemployee's desire to smoke or use tobacco products. 
                  (b)  Violations of this chapter by an employee shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action under the provisions of the city personnel ordinance now in effect or as amended hereafter. 
                  (c)  Any nonemployee of the city who continues to violate the provisions of section 59-2, after receiving an oral request to cease smoking of a cigarette or cigar or other use of tobacco material from authorized personnel with offices located within the enclosed building or having responsibility for the motor vehicle, shall be subject to citation to the Municipal Court of the City of Calhoun and, upon adjudication of guilt, shall be fined according to section 1-7. 
                  (d)  The mayor and council, in implementing the provisions of this chapter, shall authorize the head of each department to enforce the posting of signs and enforcement within their individual department.

                  (c)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes.

                  2.  Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be;

                  2.  The importance of the building, structure, site, tree, or object to the ambiance of a district; 
                  3.  The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, site, tree, or object because of its design, texture, material, detail, or unique location; 
                  4.  Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the historic district or in the city; 
                  5.  Whether there are definite plans for use of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be; 
                  6.  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, site, tree, or object from collapse; and 
                  7.  Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value. 
                  (g)  Undue hardship. When, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to said provisions, or to interpret the meaning of said provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship, provided such variances, modifications, or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property, shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making. 
                  (h)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the filing thereof.

Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. 
                  (2)  Failure of the commission to act within said 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (i)  Necessary action to be taken by commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant.

                  (a)  It shall be unlawful for any person, after having been directed by an officer or member of the police department to move away therefrom, to remain or loiter in front of any church or other place of worship during services therein, or in front of any theater, coffeehouse, restaurant, store or other public place, or to loiter or idle away time on the sidewalks or public streets or roads of the city. 
                  (b)  A person commits the offense of loitering when the person is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. 
                  (c)  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of any offense under this section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

Likewise, the term "at-will" means the city may terminate an employee's employment, with or without cause or advance notice, as long as the city does not violate any applicable federal or state law. An at-will employee is not entitled to appeal the decision of the city to dismiss the said employee. 
                  (b)  Any city employee whose office or position is allocated to permanent appointment (the appointment of an employee to a full-time position which is considered to be a continuous year-round position, with benefits associated with the type of position) and was so employed before the passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived, who has been demoted for cause, suspended, dismissed, or has been given a third written reprimand within a 12-month period (hereinafter called a "disciplinary action") shall be allowed the following appeal rights by filing a written demand for a hearing with the director ofhuman resources (DHR) within five working days of written notice from the city of such disciplinary action: 
                  (1)  The mayor and council shall serve as the city personnel review panel (hereinafter "panel") or they may appoint a city personnel review examiner (hereinafter "examiner"). The panel or examiner shall be impartial and shall conduct hearings to review the disciplinary action. The panel or examiner is granted the authority to sustain or reverse the disciplinary action. If a panel is convened, the mayor shall act as the presiding officer and shall vote in the event of a tie vote among the panel members. A quorum of three shall be competent to conduct hearings and should the mayor not be a part of the quorum, then a presiding officer shall be elected from the quorum from its assembled members and such presiding officer shall conduct the hearing and vote only in the event of a tie vote among the remaining panel members. 
                  (2)  The charges supporting the disciplinary action shall be specified by the city attorney in a written notice which, together with a copy of this section, shall be delivered personally or by mail addressed to the employee either at his last known address within ten working days after a written demand for a hearing is timely filed by the employee with the DHR. 
                  (3)  In the event of such demand, a hearing shall be scheduled by the panel or the examiner, with not less than five working days' notice to the parties. The notice shall be in writing and shall include the date, time, and place of the hearing, and a short statement of the issue(s) involved. 
                  (4)  The hearing is intended to be less formal than a court hearing, but orderly. To ensure orderliness, the hearing procedures of a civil case in courts of record in the state will be followed, however, the Georgia Civil Practice Act does not govern the hearing proceedings. The city attorney will represent the interests of the city at any hearing and the employee may represent himself or may choose to be represented by an attorney. 
                  (5)  With respect to any such hearing, the mayor, upon written application of any party, shall issue subpoenas requiring the appearance of witnesses for the purpose of taking evidence or requiring the production of any books, papers or documents relevant to the inquiry. 
                  (6)  The panel or examiner shall enter its written decision within ten working days after completion of the hearing or the compilation of any written transcript if the hearing was recorded and either serve a copy of such decision upon the employee personally or by mail addressed to the employee at his last known address. 
                  (7)  Any employee aggrieved by a decision of the panel or examiner regarding his or her appeal of a disciplinary action may apply for a writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of Gordon County, Georgia. 
                  (8)  All hearings either before the panel or examiner involving a disciplinary action shall be open to the public.

The city will not hire any applicant who tests positive on a detection test for illegal drugs. The city will not hire any applicant who tests positive for alcohol at any level which could impair his ability to perform the job for which he applied to any appreciable degree. Such individuals will be prohibited from employment with the city for one year from the application date, unless they provide certified documentation of successful completion of a substance abuse rehabilitation program. Applicants who have completed a rehabilitation program will be subject to a drug screening prior to being employed. 
                  (b)  Any city employee, before being transferred from a city job position to a city safety sensitive position (as defined in section 70-71), as a condition of such transfer shall submit to a test for drugs and alcohol. A refusal to submit to such tests will result in the city's refusal to transfer the employee to the safety sensitive position. 
                  (c)  In instances where this article regarding preemployment and pretransfer testing conflicts with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the provisions of ADA and the Act of 1973 shall be followed. 
                  (Ord. No. 623A, § 3(1), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(1), 6-16-2003) 
                  Sec. 70-93. - Post-reportable incident testing. 
                  Any city employee who is involved in a reportable incident (as defined in section 70-71) shall submit to a drug and alcohol test as soon as possible after such incident. No drug test will be administered later than 32 hours after the incident. No alcohol test will be administered later than eight hours after the incident. Whenever a test cannot be administered within these time limits, the employee's supervisor shall prepare a written statement of the reasons that the tests were not timely administered. Whenever an alcohol test is not administered within two hours after the incident, the employee's supervisor shall prepare a written statement of the reasons that the test was not promptly administered. An employee who is unable to submit to testing at the time of the incident because of serious injury received in the incident shall provide the city the necessary authorization for obtaining hospital reports or other documents that would indicate the presence of any controlled substances or alcohol in the employee's system at the time of the incident. Refusal to provide such authorization may be treated by the city as a refusal to submit to testing under this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 623A, § 3(2), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(2), 6-16-2003) 
                  Sec. 70-94. - Safety sensitive positions; random testing. 
                  Any city employee in a safety sensitive position (as defined in section 70-71) shall be subject to a random selection process whereby such employees will be selected and requested to be tested for use of controlled substances and alcohol. The selection of method shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' social security numbers, payroll identification numbers or other comparable identifying numbers. Under this procedure at least 50 percent of city employees in safety sensitive positions will be subject to drug testing each calendar year and at least 25 percent of such employees shall be subject to alcohol testing each calendar year. Under the selection process used, each city employee in a safety sensitive position shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. All tests conducted under this section shall be unannounced and the dates for such random tests shall be spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. Upon notification of the random test, the employee shall proceed to the test site immediately; provided, however, if the employee is performing a safety sensitive function at the time of notification, the employee's supervisor shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform the safety sensitive function in a safe manner before proceeding to the testing site. 
                  (Ord. No. 623A, § 3(3), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(3), 6-16-2003) 
                  Sec. 70-95. - Reasonable cause testing. 
                  (a)  Any city employee shall submit to a drug or alcohol test whenever the city has reasonable cause to believe that the employee is using a controlled substance, illegal drug or alcohol. The city's decision to test an employee shall be based upon reasonable cause as determined from observation of the employee's actions, appearance, speech, body odors, or conduct during assigned work hours or any time an employee is using a city vehicle or wearing a city uniform, which indicate the possible use of a controlled substance, illegal drug or alcohol. The actions, appearance, speech, body odors, or conduct of the employee indicating possible drug or alcohol use must be witnessed by at least one supervisor in the department to which the employee is assigned. The supervisor who witnesses conditions warranting a drug test shall prepare and sign a statement describing the employee's conduct within 24 hours of the observed behavior or before the results of the test are released, whichever is earlier. Third-party reports that indicate the possible use of a controlled substance, illegal drug or alcohol in contravention of this article shall not constitute reasonable cause, but may be cause for the observation of the employee by a supervisor. The city will provide transportation to the testing site for any employee to be tested based upon reasonable cause. 
                  (b)  If an alcohol test cannot be performed within two hours following a determination of reasonable cause to conduct such test, the supervisor shall prepare a written statement why the test was not administered. If an alcohol test is not performed within eight hours of a determination of reasonable cause to conduct such test, the test shall not be performed and the supervisor shall prepare a written statement why the test was not performed. 
                  (c)  Reasonable cause or suspicion that an employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol includes, but is not limited to, any of the following criteria: 
                  (1)  An employee seems disoriented. 
                  (2)  Confirmed reports from police, citizens or other employees of drug or alcohol use or abnormal, potentially dangerous behavior. 
                  (3)  Medical or physical information such as track marks. 
                  (4)  Absenteeism or tardiness. 
                  (5)  Any articulable facts which lead supervisors or department heads to believe an employee is in possession of drugs or alcohol, or is under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 
                  (6)  The accumulation of facts that indicate an employee, because of drug or alcohol abuse, is unfit for duty. 
                  (d)  The areas of observation listed in section 70-75 will be used as a guide for such determination. 
                  (Ord. No. 623A, § 3(4), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(4), 6-16-2003) 
                  Sec. 70-96. - Return to duty and followup testing. 
                  Any employee who is not discharged following a violation of this article as it concerns alcohol may not resume his job without first having completed a recommended course of treatment of alcohol abuse and passing an alcohol test. Any employee who is not discharged following a violation of this article as it concerns controlled substances may not resume his job without first having completed a drug rehabilitation program and passing a controlled substances test. Upon resumption of his duties after completion of the alcohol or drug rehabilitation program, the employee will be subject to unannounced testing over a period of 12 to 60 months. At least six unannounced tests shall be conducted during the first 18 months after his return to duty. The type, frequency, and timing of such testing shall be at the direction of the city's substance abuse professional, who may terminate the testing at any point after the first six tests under this provision. Any positive test for either alcohol or controlled substances in a return to duty or follow up situation shall result in the immediate permanent discharge of the employee. 
                  (Ord. No. 623A, § 3(5), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(5), 6-16-2003) 
                  Sec. 70-97. - Fitness for duty. 
                  Supervisors shall take appropriate action to protect city personnel and city property by removing from the work premises or site any individual not in condition to perform assigned work in a normal and safe manner. An employee who appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol shall be taken to the designated collection site for drug and alcohol testing. Employees shall not be allowed to drive any vehicle if it appears that they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs. If a drug or alcohol test cannot be administered under this article, the apparently impaired individual shall nonetheless remain ineligible to perform his duties for at least 24 hours. 
                  (Ord. No. 623A, § 3(6), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(6), 6-16-2003) 
                  Sec. 70-98. - Reports by employees. 
                  If a city employee has reasonable suspicion that a supervisor is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the employee's observations shall be reported to the supervisor's immediate superior. If the employee feels that reporting these observations in this manner would adversely affect the employee's working conditions, the report may be made to the director of public works or the city administrator. 
                  (Ord. No. 623A, § 3(7), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(7), 6-16-2003) 
                  Sec. 70-99. - Exemption for prescribed medical treatment. 
                  The use of a legally controlled substance as part of a prescribed medical treatment by a licensed physician will not subject a city employee to disciplinary action or a denial of employment if that treatment does not adversely affect job performance. Prescribed use must be substantiated by a physician's report or statement. If the use of the prescribed drug adversely affects an employee's job performance or is detrimental to the public trust or safety of other employees or citizens, it is in the best interest of the employee and the city for the employee to be placed on a leave of absence. Leaves of absence will be used in accordance with current personnel policies.

                  Sec. 70-100. - Compliance to be condition of employment. 
                  Compliance with this article is a condition of employment. The failure or refusal of an applicant conditionally offered employment or of an employee to cooperate fully by submitting to any test or procedure under this article or to sign any consent form or other document required by the testing laboratory or collection facility personnel shall be grounds for refusal to hire, termination or other disciplinary action.

                  Sec. 70-101. - Retesting; appeals. 
                  Upon report of a positive test, the employee or applicant will be notified of the test results. As part of that notification, he will be provided an opportunity to explain any positive results. An employee or applicant whose test results were positive may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a retest conducted of the original sample at a laboratory of the employee's or applicant's choice provided such laboratory shall be certified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services under the procedures prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR 40. An employee or applicant shall request such retest within 72 hours from the time of notification of the original test results. The laboratory used for the retest shall have chain of custody procedures to ensure proper identification, labeling and handling of test samples and proper exchange with and return of the samples to the original medical group or laboratory. Following such retest, a final determination will be made by the appropriate authority. Employees who have disciplinary action taken against them as a result of a positive drug or alcohol test may file an appeal under the applicable appeal procedure.

                  DIVISION 3. - TESTING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES 

                  Sec. 70-121. - Drug testing procedures. 
                  (a)  The laboratory performing drug testing for the city under the terms of this article shall be certified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services under the procedures prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR 40. The designated laboratory for performing drug tests pursuant to this article is Labcorp, 13900 Park Center Road, Herndon, VA 22071, and other future approved labs. Drug testing of covered employees shall conform to the following procedures: 
                  (1)  Drug tests shall be performed on urine specimens collected in accordance with procedures and standards prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR 40.23 and 40.25. 
                  (2)  All analysis of drug tests performed pursuant to this article shall meet the standards prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR 40.29. Urine specimens shall be tested only for evidence of use of the following prohibited drugs: marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP). 
                  (3)  Urine specimens shall be collected at a designated collection site by a collection station person (CSP). A collection site will be any suitable location at which a specimen of urine can be collected under the required conditions for privacy, security, and temporary storage of the specimens. The collection site will have at least an enclosure for private urination, a toilet, some surface for writing, and a source of water for washing hands which, if practical, will be located outside of the privacy enclosure. Unless an employee is notified otherwise prior to a test, the designated collection site under this article shall be at Gordon Urgent Care located at 100 Hospital Court, Calhoun, Georgia 30701. Any one of the physicians affiliated with Gordon Urgent Care is also designated as the medical review officer for the purposes of this article. During specimen collection, the CSP will restrict access to the collection site. If the CSP is not a medical professional or if the employee has less than complete privacy, the CSP shall be of the same gender as the employee. Once the employee has completed giving the specimen, no person other than the CSP shall be permitted to handle the specimen until it is secured for transport. The CSP shall not observe the collection of urine except when there is reason to believe that the employee may alter or substitute the specimen. If the CSP has reason to believe the employee has tampered with a sample, another sample shall be drawn under the same gender observation. The CSP will use a standardized custody and control form to ensure that the chain of custody is maintained over a sample from the time it is received from the employee to the time of the analysis of contents to the ultimate return of results to the medical review officer. The CSP will also use a tamperproof seal system that prevents undetected opening of the specimen bottle and that identifies the sample with a number also appearing on the custody and control form. The CSP will also use a tamperproof shipping container which may be scaled and which allows the paperwork to be attached. Each urine specimen collected will be subdivided into two bottles labeled as "primary" and "split" specimen. Only the primary specimen will be opened and used for urinalysis. The split specimen bottle will remain sealed and will be stored at the laboratory. If analysis of the primary specimen confirms the presence of illegal controlled substances, employee will have 72 hours from the time of notification by the medical review officer to request that the split specimen be sent to another certified laboratory for a second analysis. A request for analysis of the split specimen will not stay any city actions or procedures otherwise required by this article. 
                  (4)  Urine samples shall be analyzed using both a screen test and a confirmatory test. If the screen test result is negative, the laboratory will report the result of the test as negative. If a positive result for one or more controlled substances is obtained through a screening test, then a confirmatory test shall be performed for each identified drug. Only if the confirmatory test result is again positive will the laboratory report a positive result to the medical review officer. 
                  (5)  The refusal of an applicant or employee to submit to a drug test or the failure to pass a drug test required by this article shall be cause for the refusal to hire an applicant as well as cause for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge of an employee. 
                  (Ord. No. 623A, § 4(A), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 4(A), 6-16-2003) 
                  Sec. 70-122. - Drug reporting procedures. 
                  (a)  The medical review officer (MRO) designated to receive, review, report, and file drug test information transmitted by the testing laboratory is Gordon Urgent Care, located at 100 Hospital Court, Calhoun, Georgia 30701. This MRO is a licensed physician who has knowledge of substance abuse disorders and who has appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate drug test results. 
                  (b)  The testing laboratory shall report test results only to the designated MRO. Test results shall not be transmitted verbally by telephone to the MRO. The testing laboratory and the MRO shall ensure the confidentiality of the transmitted information and shall limit access to any data transmission, storage, and retrieval system to ensure the security of the data transmission. 
                  (c)  The MRO shall review drug test results in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR 40.33 and by the Federal Highway Administration in 49 CFR 391.97. 
                  (d)  If the MRO determines that there is no legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed, positive drug test result other than the unauthorized use of a prohibited drug, the MRO shall notify the human resources officer of his conclusions for further proceedings in accordance with this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 623A, § 4(B), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 4(B), 6-16-2003) 
                  Sec. 70-123. - Alcohol testing procedures. 
                  (a)  Alcohol tests shall be conducted using a breathalyzer approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). A breath alcohol technician (BAT) who is trained in department of transportation testing procedures shall administer all alcohol breath tests under this article. 
                  (b)  The breath test shall be conducted in a place that offers visual and aural privacy to the employee. All necessary equipment shall be provided at the testing location, which shall be secured from unauthorized entry. 
                  (c)  Prior to the test, the BAT will require the employee to provide positive identification. The BAT will explain the testing procedure to the employee before administering any test. 
                  (d)  A breath test shall consist of a screening test and confirmatory test. The screening test will be conducted by first opening an individually sealed mouthpiece in view of the employee and attaching it to the testing device. The BAT will then instruct the employee to blow into the mouthpiece for a minimum of six seconds or until the device indicates that an adequate amount of breath has been obtained. The employee must then be shown the result shown on the device and the result recorded. If the screen test reveals a blood alcohol level below 0.02, no further testing is required and the test result is considered negative. If, however, the screen test result is 0.02 or greater, the BAT must perform a confirmatory test. The BAT shall not conduct a confirmatory test until the expiration of a waiting period of not less than 15 minutes and not more than 20 minutes from the initial test. A new mouthpiece shall be used. The confirmatory test shall be conducted using a testing device that prints out or otherwise provides a hard copy of the test results, the date and time, a sequential test number, and the name and serial number of the testing device. Whenever the results of the screen test and confirmatory test are not identical, the confirmatory test shall be deemed the final test result. A blood alcohol level of 0.04 or greater on the final test shall constitute a positive alcohol test result. 
                  (e)  The alcohol testing of the city employees shall be conducted by qualified personnel of the city police department. 
                  (f)  The refusal of an employee to submit to an alcohol test or the failure to pass an alcohol test required by this article shall be cause for disqualification from all driving duties, as well as cause for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Employees who have a blood alcohol level of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 when tested just before, during or just after performing any driving duties are ineligible to return to duty for at least 24 hours or until another breath test is administered for which the result is less than 0.02. 
                  (g)  Employees who violate this article as to alcohol will be referred to a substance abuse professional for evaluation. The employee shall comply with any recommended treatment as a precondition to resuming his duties.

                  (a)  The city shall provide materials concerning the effects of alcohol and use of controlled substances on an individual's health, work, and personal life, signs and symptoms of an alcohol or a controlled substances problem (the employee's or a co-worker's), and available methods of intervening when an alcohol or a controlled substances problem is suspected, including confrontation, referral to any employee assistance program and/or referral to a supervisor. 
                  (b)  In addition, the city shall provide training for supervisory personnel who will determine whether a covered employee must be tested for alcohol or drug use based on reasonable cause. Additional supervisory training may cover the effects and consequences of drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment.

Furthermore, each employee who engages in any conduct prohibited by this article shall be evaluated by the city's substance abuse professional, who shall determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and controlled substances use. 
                  (b)  No aspect of this article shall require the city to provide an employee assistance program (EAP) for employees subject to drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this article and for supervisory personnel. From time to time, the city may provide an EAP for employees subject to drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this article. The availability of, and eligibility for, benefits under any such EAP shall be governed by the terms of the EAP. However, entry into, or participation in, any EAP shall not excuse an employee from the testing provisions of this article or requirements for removal from duty.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

                  Garage sale means all sales entitled "garage sale," "lawn sale," "attic sale," "rummage sale," "moving sale," "estate sale," or "flea market sale," or any similar casual sale of tangible personal property which is advertised by any means, including by display only, whereby the public at large is or can be made aware of such sale. 
                  Nonprofit organization means and includes, but is not limited to, churches, church auxiliary organizations, student groups and parent-teacher organizations, fraternal organizations, hospital auxiliary groups, historical societies, service clubs, and educational societies conducting a garage sale on property owned or controlled by the nonprofit organization. 
                  Person includes individuals, partnerships, voluntary associations, corporations and transient vendors, but shall not include nonprofit organizations. 
                  Transient vendor means one who sells tangible personal property from public or private premises but remains at one place for that purpose for temporary periods only not exceeding four weeks.

                  Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
                  Sec. 74-52. - Findings of fact. 
                  The mayor and council find that garage sales by residents and transient vendors are conducted frequently within the commercially zoned districts in the city on private property without regard to the creation of traffic congestion created around the sales site. The traffic congestion around such sales sites impedes traffic and constitutes a public safety hazard. The mayor and council further find that garage sales by residents and transient vendors in commercially zoned districts in the city discourage the revitalization of the business district by creating unsightly clutter, signage, crowded conditions, litter and sanitation problems, all to the detriment of the public health, safety and general welfare.

                  Sec. 78-31. - Size, construction and use generally. 
                  (a)  Every individual residence or establishment where people reside or congregate, or being situated in the C-1 business district, will be provided one 95-gallon plastic container by the city or its agent or contractor. 
                  (b)  Residential and commercial customers will receive one trash pickup per week at a monthly fee established by the mayor and council; however, garbage must be placed within the container(s) provided. Businesses located in the established downtown area will have the option of placing their carts on the street for pickup Monday through Friday as needed. Residential and commercial customers have the option to use up to three 95-gallon plastic containers. All downtown commercial customers who have access to a city-provided dumpster must use the dumpster in their vicinity. Downtown businesses that request 95-gallon plastic containers, instead of using the city-provided dumpsters, will make the request to the director of public works, who will determine if the business has reasonable access to a city dumpster. 
                  (c)  Commercial pickups by means other than dumpsters will be by means of a 95-gallon container provided by the city or its agent. Pickups may be scheduled for twice weekly or five times weekly (Monday through Friday). A monthly fee for residential and commercial accounts will be established by the mayor and council for one primary 95-gallon plastic container and, if requested, an additional charge for two extra 95-gallon containers. The residential or commercial customer cannot have more than three 95-gallon containers registered under one account. Each residential or commercial customer that has a separate electrical or water/sewer account with the city will be considered an individual account. When garbage volume exceeds the need for three 95-gallon containers per account, the residential or commercial customer must provide for private dumpster service. 
                  (d)  The city shall provide at no charge recycling bins for corrugated cardboard boxes in the C-1 business district. Cardboard recycling dumpsters are located at the Pine Street recycling center, downtown alleys, the library and downtown parking lots. The Pine Street recycling center also accepts other consumer products. There is no fee for using the recycling facilities. 
                  (e)  It shall be unlawful to place garbage for collection in a box, tub, crate, carton, or other container except those containers referred to in subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section. No garbage will be collected if not meeting the containment requirements. Under no circumstances will garbage be placed in a location that would obstruct drainage structures, sidewalks, alleys, streets, or other rights-of-way.

                  Sec. 78-34. - Placement for collection. 
                  In the C-1 business district, garbage containers shall be placed for garbage collection at the front of property at the street open to motor vehicle exits. At other places, garbage containers shall be placed at the property front or side where they would least constitute an eyesore to the public. In every case, containers must be securely fastened in such a manner as to prevent the container from being overturned by persons or animals. Commercial establishments must provide for the deposit of wastepaper, boxes, crates and commercial wastes, but in no event shall stacks or piles of such waste or any containers provided therefor be permitted to obstruct drains, sidewalks, alleys or streets. Under no circumstances can a dumpster be placed on the city right-of-way. The location, construction and operation of such containers shall meet the approval of the sanitation department supervisor. Containers must be removed from the street each morning before or immediately after the business has opened. Residential containers must be placed at the curb with the handle facing away from the street. Containers must be removed from the curb following pickup. When dumpsters are placed in an area that creates a nuisance to the public or other property owners a wood, metal or masonry enclosure may be required.

                  Sec. 78-35. - Commercial establishments and apartment houses. 
                  (a)  The owners and/or operators of commercial establishments and apartment houses, including public housing, consisting of four or more living units shall, subject to the determination of the sanitation supervisor, provide commercial containers in sufficient number to adequately contain the garbage and refuse disposal at the location. Any area that has four or more units, whether it is commercial or residential, must use a commercial dumpster, unless it is determined by the public works director to be impractical due to the property configuration or because a dumpster site is unavailable at the location. 
                  (b)  Garbage containers are to be placed at the curb or street 18 inches apart with the pull handle opposite the street side. All garbage containers must be removed from the street or sidewalk following pickup service. No carts will be allowed to permanently remain on the street or sidewalk.

                  (b)  Commercial waste which cannot be placed in garbage containers or dumpsters as specified in this chapter shall not be located for disposal by the city, but shall be disposed of by the persons in charge of the establishments where such wastes are created or occur.

                  Sec. 78-62. - Special waste. 
                  (a)  Rubbish and yard waste. Collection of rubbish and yard waste shall be at a time and in a manner prescribed by the street superintendent, provided that at no time shall rubbish or yard waste be placed in such a manner as to obstruct gutters, drains, sidewalks, drainage ditches, or streets. Rubbish and yard waste shall be placed in neat piles separate from residential waste behind the curbs and behind sidewalks. Grass clippings and leaves should not be bagged and shall be placed behind the curb and sidewalk. Tree branches up to eight inches in diameter and not over six feet in length will be collected. The following will not be collected: stumps or brush with root material attached, landscaping materials, metal, stone, brick, block, concrete, logs larger than eight inches in diameter, and construction material. Substantial lot clearing and construction-type development should be disposed of by the property owner or commercial hauler. Any type of commercial or contract operation will be the responsibility of the property owner for hauling and disposal of limbs and brush. Brush collection at any one residence is limited to a brush pile approximately six feet high by 12 feet wide and ten feet deep. The city will not be responsible for damage to private property when mechanically collecting brush. Any residence or business that placed out for collection items other than prescribed in this section are in violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Old furniture, appliances and similar items. Old furniture, appliances, household goods, bedding, white goods, lawn mowers, tires, carpet, scrap metal and other durable type goods will not be disposed of as residential or rubbish collections. Such items may be collected by the city upon request and payment of a fee as prescribed in the city fee schedule resolution. However, the city will offer residential pickups for these items at a fee of $20.00 per item. The fee is to be prepaid at city hall at which time a work order will be initiated and the work scheduled. 
                  (c)  Construction debris. Construction items such as rock, dirt, brick, block, scrap metal, scrap lumber, siding, roofing, concrete or any type of waste product associated with construction, renovation or remodeling shall be disposed of by commercial haulers or by other means than residential or rubbish collection by the city.

                  (a)  Angle of intersection. Intersections shall be at right angles and shall not be at an angle of less than 75 degrees for safety, topography, interference with utilities, or separation from other driveways. 
                  (b)  Intersection radius. Intersection radii for all streets shall be measured at the back of curb or edge of pavement if no curb exists. The minimum roadway radii for the intersection of residential subdivision streets are 25 feet. Minor collector radii shall be 50 feet. Major collector radii shall be 75 feet. When a local or residential collector intersects a higher classification of roadway, the radii shall be a minimum of 30 feet. Larger radii may be required for streets intersecting at angles less than 90 degrees.

All new proposed streets shall be designed and constructed to the standards contained in the regulations, in accordance with the classification of said streets. The arrangement of local streets shall permit practical patterns, shapes, and sizes of development parcels. Streets, as a function of land use, must not unduly hinder the development of land. Distances between streets, angles of intersections, number of streets, and related elements all have a bearing on efficient lot layout of an area. 
                  (b)  Local residential streets. 
                  (1)  Local streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
                  (2)  Local residential streets shall be 20 feet wide as measured from front of curb to front of curb. This provides for a ten-foot lane in each travel direction. See Standard Detail 401. 
                  (c)  Minor and major collector streets. Collector streets shall be provided to channel through traffic movements within a development as part of, or in addition to, the current thoroughfare network.

Maximum vehicle trips per day, in a cul-de-sac development, shall be based on 300 trips using eight trips per housing unit as an average. Spur streets off of the primary cul-de-sac street shall be considered part of the above vehicle trip calculation. No structure in a cul-de-sac designed development, or multiple cul-de-sac development, with no other ingress/egress points, shall be more than 1,500 feet from a primary ingress/egress for public safety reasons. Multiple ingress/egress to arterial streets is recommended for community connectivity and public safety access. Cul-de-sacs shall conform to layouts and dimension requirements. See Standard Detail 410. 
                  (b)  The length of a cul-de-sac street shall be measured from the center of the intersection with another street, whether a through street or another cul-de-sac or dead-end street. 
                  (c)  Bubble cul-de-sacs (half cul-de-sacs) at "right-angled" intersections, having an interior angle between 80 degrees and 100 degrees, are for local residential streets only.

                  Sec. 82-43. - Grades. 
                  (a)  Minimum grades. The minimum grade for all streets shall be 1½ percent. Grades of less than 1½ percent may be approved by the city street inspector, based on adequate engineering designs, where at least 1½ percent cannot reasonably be achieved due to topographical limitations imposed by the land. In such cases, a record drawing and such computations as necessary shall be provided after construction to establish that the street will drain in accordance with these regulations. Street sections where unacceptable pooling, excessive spread at catch basins, or other hazardous conditions occur, shall be reconstructed or otherwise improved to eliminate such conditions. 
                  (b)  Maximum grades. 
                  (1)  The maximum grade for all local and residential streets shall be 14 percent. 

                   
                  (2)  Maximum grade on any cul-de-sac turnaround shall be limited by drainage concerns. 
                  (3)  All banks should be graded to a 3:1 slope; 2:1 may be approved by the street inspector where needed.

                  (a)  Sight distance requirements at intersections shall be as follows: 

                   
                  Distances shall be measured from centerline of ingress/egress road extending to either side of abutting street along thoroughfare. Intersections within subdivisions shall be designed for a minimum sight distance of 200 feet. 
                  (b)  Vertical alignment must be designed in conjunction with the horizontal alignment. All changes in street profile grades having an algebraic difference greater than one percent shall be connected by a parabolic curve. 
                  (c)  Minimum safe stopping distance is a direct function of the design speed, 25 miles per hour in residential areas, and 35 miles per hour in local, nonresidential and commercial areas. A height of eye of 3½ feet and height of object of one-half foot is used to determine safe stopping sight distance. 
                  (d)  The minimum length of vertical curve required for safe stopping sight distance shall be calculated using AASHTO A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, latest edition.

                  Sec. 82-45. - Sight distance for horizontal curves. 
                  The sight distance for horizontal curves at subdivision entrances is determined by the line of sight available two feet above the street surface. The sight distance is measured along the existing edge of pavement beginning at the centerline of the proposed entrance and ending where the line of sight intersects it. The line of sight is the projected line of visibility beginning at the entrance centerline and tangent to an obstruction two feet above the street surface. Examples of obstructions are vegetation, ground cover, signs, utilities, existing topography, etc.

                  Sec. 82-46. - Base and pavement specifications. 
                  (a)  Minimum construction standards are as follows (Standard Details 401 through 403): 

                   
                  (1)  The structural number and allowable equivalent single axle load repetitions (ESALs) for the revised pavement sections are similar to those derived from the current standard sections. We believe that by limiting the thickness of graded aggregate base (GAB) to six inches for the minor collector and residential standard sections, construction efficiency will increase and costs may decrease since the GAB could be installed in one layer instead of two, as would be required for any GAB layers thicker than eight inches. Subgrade preparation requirements, GAB compaction requirements, and specified pavement types are in accordance with Georgia DOT standards. 
                  (2)  In general, all pavement construction should be in accordance with Georgia DOT specifications. Proper subgrade compaction, adherence to Georgia DOT specifications, and compliance with project plans and specifications will be critical to the performance of the constructed pavement. 
                  (3)  For major collectors, engineers can submit alternate pavement designs for city review and consideration. 
                  (b)  Concrete pavement alternatives. The following are concrete pavement alternatives for minor collector roads and major collector roads: 

                   
                  (1)  The structural number and single axle load repetitions (ESALs) for the concrete pavement sections are similar to those derived from the current standards asphaltic concrete sections. 
                  (2)  A 650-psi flexural strength concrete mix should be used. This corresponds to a compressive strength of approximately 4,500 psi. Portland cement concrete pavement should contain four to six percent entrained air, assuming the mix will contain three-fourths- to one-inch nominal maximum size aggregate. Concrete slump should be no more than four inches. 
                  (3)  Construction joints and other design details should be in accordance with guidelines provided by the Portland Cement Association and the American Concrete Institute. In general, all pavement construction should be in accordance with Georgia DOT specifications. Proper subgrade compaction, adherence to Georgia DOT specifications, and compliance with project plans and specifications will be critical to the performance of the constructed pavement.

                  (h)  Collection fee allowed lodging providers.

                  (16)  Wastewater containing more than 75 milligrams per liter of oils, fat, grease, or wax, whether emulsified or not, or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees Celsius) and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius). 
                  (17)  Any waters or wastes containing taste-producing substances exceeding limits which may be established by the city. 
                  (18)  Any pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
                  (19)  Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety. 
                  (20)  Disposal of trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the utilities general manager. 
                  (21)  Discharge of hazardous wastes. 
                  a.  The industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place within 180 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this subsection is derived. Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of the ordinance from which this subsection is derived shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this subsection does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), and (e). 
                  b.  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a)(21)a of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  c.  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  d.  In the case of any notification made under subsection (a)(21)a of this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practicable. 
                  (22)  Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form solids which interfere with the collection system or create a condition deleterious to structures and treatment processes. 
                  (e)  Permit for exceeding concentration limits. The utilities general manager may issue permits specifying limits greater than the limits in this article based on special agreements with the city, provided that all applicable state and/or federal categorical pretreatment requirements are met and provided that local treatment plant mass loadings are not violated. The permission to exceed concentration limits will be revoked if local treatment plant mass loadings are exceeded. Additional testing requirements will be necessary for an industry which seeks permission to exceed concentration limits and may include testing of the waste treatment plant influent and effluent as well as the user's own effluent. The costs associated with such testing will be paid by the user for the parameter the user seeks permission to exceed. 
                  (f)  Modification of limits. The city reserves the right to modify the industrial discharge limits and conditions at the time of the permit renewal. Industrial users requesting a permit variance must do so at least 60 days prior to the expiration of their discharge permit. 
                  (g)  Exemption from BOD loading levels. Industrial users that contribute mass BOD 5 loading at levels below one-fourth of one percent of the design BOD 5 loading may be exempt from industrial pretreatment requirements, unless they are subject to federal categorical pretreatment standards, in which case they will not be exempt. However, the city reserves the right to terminate such exemption provisions if the industrial discharge is deemed to interfere with POTW operations. 
                  (h)  Local limits. The following are state environmental protection division approved technically based local limits for 12 mgd and 16 mgd average daily flows at the POTW. The city shall enforce the adopted limits for the 12 mgd plant until the current plant expansion to 16 mgd is completed. 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  1 Daily maximum total toxic organics as defined in 40 CFR 433.11(e). 
                  2 Domestic/background concentration. 
                  (i)  Reallocation of loading of BOD and zinc. The city reserves the right to permit select or all industrial users for mass-based limits for BOD 5 and zinc by employing a modified "mass proportion method" to reallocate surpluses. However, the total loadings shall at no time exceed the allowance headworks loadings for the respective parameters.

                  (1)  Except as indicated in subsection (c)(2) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. If flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the utilities general manager may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
                  (2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
                  (d)  Timing of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
                  (e)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the utilities general manager.

                  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections, shall be available without restriction unless the user contends such information and data constitute a trade secret, in which case the information may be withheld from the general public. The effluent data will never be considered as confidential information. Information accepted by the city as confidential, and portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes, shall be transmitted to a governmental agency when required to document compliance with the pretreatment program. In matters of judicial review or enforcement proceedings against an industrial user, the city shall provide all available information pertaining to that industry to the governmental agency.

                  Sec. 94-186. - Monitoring facilities. 
                  The city shall require to be provided and operated, at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer, and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.

                  Sec. 94-187. - Effect of new federal categorical pretreatment standards; modification of federal pretreatment standards. 
                  (a)  Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The utilities general manager shall notify all affected users of the new standard and applicable reporting requirements. 
                  (b)  Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the state for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. For purposes of this subsection, the term "consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system and 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in section 403.7(c)(2) or 40 CFR 403, "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution," promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403, section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.

                  (a)  The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405 through 471, are hereby incorporated. 
                  (b)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the utilities general manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
                  (c)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the utilities general manager shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
                  (d)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by the EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
                  (e)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.

                  Sec. 94-189. - Baseline monitoring reports. 
                  (a)  Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the utilities general manager a report which contains the information listed in subsection (b) of this section. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the utilities general manager a report which contains the information listed in subsection (b) of this section. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
                  (b)  Users described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit the following information: 
                  (1)  Identifying information. The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner. 
                  (2)  Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
                  (3)  Description of operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operations carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
                  (4)  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
                  (5)  Measurement of pollutants. 
                  a.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
                  b.  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the utilities general manager, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and longterm average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with accepted procedures. 
                  Sampling must be performed in accordance with accepted procedures. 
                  (6)  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
                  (7)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard.

                  (a)  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the utilities general manager, but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 94-171. 
                  (b)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
                  (c)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the utilities general manager using the procedures prescribed in this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.

                  (a)  Protection from accidental discharge; slug control plan. Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge or slug loading of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. A slug discharge is any discharge of a nonroutine, episodic nature, including, but not limited to, an accidental spill or a noncustomary batch discharge. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug loading of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, before construction of the facility. The city shall evaluate all industrial users of the need for developing a slug discharge plan at least every two years. Industrial users shall complete such a plan within 90 days after being notified by the city. No user shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge or slug loading procedures have been approved by the city. A slug control plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements: 
                  (1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges. 
                  (2)  Description of stored chemicals. 
                  (3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for followup written notification within five days. 
                  (4)  If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measure for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
                  Review of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge or slug loading, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. The notification shall include the location of the discharge, the type of waste, the concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
                  (b)  Written notice of accidental discharge. Within five days following an accidental discharge or slug loading, the user shall submit to the utilities general manager a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the wastewater system, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
                  (c)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event or a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
                  (d)  Upsets. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (d)(3) of this section are met. 
                  (3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, that: 
                  a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
                  b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
                  c.  The user has submitted the following information to the utilities general manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
                  1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  2.  The period of noncompliance, including the exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (6)  Users shall control production of all discharges, to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards, upon reduction, loss, or failure of the user's treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment if provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, is lost, or fails. 
                  (e)  Defenses. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions of this article or the specific prohibitions if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either: 
                  (1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or 
                  (2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
                  (f)  Bypass. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of this section: 
                  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (f)(3) and (4) of this section. 
                  (3)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the utilities general manager, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the utilities general manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The utilities general manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (4)  Bypass is prohibited, and the utilities general manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage. 
                  b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment.

                  Sec. 94-222. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
                  (a)  Notice of violation. When the utilities general manager finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this article, or a wastewater permit or order issued under this article, the utilities general manager or his agent may serve upon the user written notice of the violation. Within ten days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the utilities general manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
                  (b)  Consent orders. The utilities general manager is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  Show cause orders. The utilities general manager may order any industrial user which causes or contributes to a violation of this article, or a wastewater permit or order issued under this article, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal executive, general partner, or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued. 
                  (d)  Compliance orders. When the utilities general manager finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article or a permit or order issued under this article, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements deemed reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices. 
                  (e)  Cease and desist orders. When the utilities general manager finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article or any permit or order issued under this article, the utilities general manager may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do one of the following: 
                  (1)  Comply with the order. 
                  (2)  Take appropriate remedial or preventive action needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge.

                  Sec. 94-224. - Appeals. 
                  (a)  Any user, permit applicant, or permit holder affected by any decision, action, or determination made by the utilities general manager interpreting or implementing the provisions of this article or in any permit issued under this article may file with the utilities general manager a written request for reconsideration within 30 days of such decision, action, or determination, setting forth in detail the facts supporting the user's request for reconsideration. 
                  (b)  If the finding made by the utilities general manager is unsatisfactory to the person requesting reconsideration, he may, within 30 days after notification of the action, file a written appeal to the city council. The written appeal shall be heard within 30 days from the date of filing. The city council shall make a final recommendation on the appeal within 15 days of the close of the meeting. The utilities general manager's decision, action, or determination shall remain in effect during such period of reconsideration. Appeal from the decision of the city council shall be as provided for by law.

                  Sec. 94-225. - Judicial proceedings and relief. 
                  The utilities general manager may initiate proceedings in the superior court of the county against any person or industrial user who is alleged to have violated or is about to violate the pretreatment program. In such action, the utilities general manager may seek, and the court may grant, injunctive relief and any other relief available in law or equity. 
                  (Code 1988, § 11-31; Ord. No. 541B, § 2, 5-9-1994; Ord. No. 613, § 10.4, 6-9-1997) 
                  Sec. 94-226. - Authority to terminate service; revocation of discharge permit. 
                  (a)  Termination of service after notice and hearing. In addition to other remedies provided in this article, the utilities general manager may issue a show cause notice to any user who appears to be violating any provision of this article to show cause why sewer service should not be discontinued. The notice shall include the nature of the violation with sufficient specificity as to the character of the violation and the dates on which such violations occurred to enable the user to prepare a defense. Such notice shall be mailed to the user by certified mail, return receipt requested, or shall be personally delivered to the user at least 20 days prior to the proposed action, except in the event of an emergency. At the show cause hearing, the user may present any defense to such charges, either in person or through submission of written or documentary proof. Following the hearing or opportunity for a hearing, the city may at the city's discretion order termination of sewer service if satisfied from all available proof that the violation was willful and the termination is necessary to abate the offending condition or to prevent future violations. The city may terminate service for a period not to exceed one year for a willful violation and may terminate service indefinitely to abate offending conditions or prevent future violations subject to the correction of such conditions or violations by the user. Any violation of provisions of this article that is not corrected or abated following a notice and opportunity for a hearing shall be grounds for termination of water service and/or plugging of the sewer line. 
                  (b)  Emergency termination of service. 
                  (1)  The utilities general manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The utilities general manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
                  (2)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the utilities general manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The utilities general manager may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the utilities general manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (c) of this section are initiated against the user. 
                  (3)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the utilities general manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing. 
                  (4)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
                  (c)  Revocation of discharge permit. The utilities general manager may revoke a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the utilities general manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
                  (1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
                  (2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
                  (3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
                  (4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; 
                  (5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 94-146; 
                  (6)  Failure to notify the utilities general manager of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge; 
                  (7)  Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application; 
                  (8)  Falsifying self-monitoring reports; 
                  (9)  Tampering with monitoring equipment; 
                  (10)  Refusing to allow the utilities general manager timely access to the facility premises and records; 
                  (11)  Failure to meet effluent limitations; 
                  (12)  Failure to pay fines; 
                  (13)  Failure to pay sewer charges; 
                  (14)  Failure to meet compliance schedules; 
                  (15)  Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge permit application; 
                  (16)  Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business ownership of a permitted facility; or 
                  (17)  Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this article. 
                  (d)  Voiding of discharge permit. Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to that user.

                  (b)  Assessment procedure; appeals. Any civil penalty shall be assessed in the following manner: 
                  (1)  The utilities general manager may issue an assessment against any person or industrial user responsible for the violation. 
                  (2)  Any person or industrial user against whom an assessment has been issued may secure a review of such assessment by filing with the utilities general manager a written petition setting forth the grounds and reasons for his objections and asking for a hearing on the matter involved before the city council. If a petition for review of the assessment is not filed within 30 days of the date the assessment is served, the violator shall be deemed to have consented to the assessment, and it shall become final. 
                  (3)  When any assessment becomes final because of a person's failure to appeal the utilities general manager' assessment, the utilities general manager may apply to the municipal court for a judgment and seek execution of such judgment and the court, in such proceedings, shall treat a failure to appeal such assessment as a confession of judgment in the amount of the assessment. 
                  (4)  In assessing the civil penalty, the utilities general manager may consider the following factors: 
                  a.  Whether the civil penalty imposed will be a substantial economic deterrent to the illegal activity. 
                  b.  Damages to the city, including compensation for the damage or destruction of the facilities of the POTW, which also includes any penalties, costs, and attorneys' fees incurred by the city as the result of the illegal activity, as well as the expenses involved in enforcing this article and the costs involved in rectifying any damages. 
                  c.  The cause of the discharge or violation. 
                  d.  The severity of the discharge and its effect upon the facilities of the POTW and upon the quality and quantity of the receiving waters. 
                  e.  The effectiveness of action taken by the violator to cease the violation. 
                  f.  The technical and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the discharge. 
                  g.  The economic benefit gained by the violator. 
                  (5)  The utilities general manager may institute proceedings for assessment in the name of the city in the superior court of the county if the violation occurred in the county. 
                  (c)  Schedule of penalties. The city may establish by regulation a schedule of the amount of civil penalty which can be assessed by the utilities general manager for certain specific violations or categories of violations. 
                  (d)  Assessment of penalties by state. Civil penalties in excess of $1,000.00 per day for each day of the violation may be assessed by the director of the environmental protection division of the state department of natural resources.

When the utilities general manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utilities general manager may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation per day. In the case of monthly or other longterm average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
                  (b)  Interest; lien.

                  (c)  Appeals; payment of costs of enforcement actions. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the utilities general manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine.

                  A.  Purpose and intent. The PRD district is intended to allow flexible site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development so that innovative land planning methods may be utilized which foster natural resource conservation and neighborhood cohesiveness as well as neo-traditional developments. This may permit buildings to be clustered or arranged in an unconventional manner to maximize open space, create a pedestrian scale and provide other public benefits. In this district smaller lots than might otherwise be permitted under traditional zoning districts may be allowed. However, the purpose is not merely to allow smaller lots or reduce development requirements but to achieve other goals including the protection of sensitive environmental, historic, or aesthetic resources as well as the provision of site amenities such as parks, open space, walking trails, etc. The PRD district is not intended to encourage greater density of development, but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning techniques which result in quality residential patterns that conserve and create open space, reduce vehicle trips and provide stable developments, which enhance the surrounding area. 
                  B.  Permitted uses. 
                  1.  Single-family detached dwelling units upon lots with a minimum area of 10,000 square feet.

                  ARTICLE X. - SIGN ORDINANCE 

                  Sec. 10.1. - Title. 
                  This article shall be known and may be referred to as the "Sign Ordinance of the City of Calhoun." 
                  (Ord. No. 927, § 1, 11-25-2013) 
                  Section 10.1.1. - Authority. 
                  This article is enacted pursuant to the general police powers of the city and other authority provided by federal, state and local laws applicable hereto. 
                  (Ord. No. 927, § 1, 11-25-2013) 
                  Section 10.1.2. - Findings, purpose and intent. 
                  The mayor and city council find that there presently exists 98 miles of roads, streets, primary highways, and interstate highways within the city limits of which 12.77 miles are part of the primary highway system and 5.2 miles are part of the interstate highway system. There are presently 28 signs which can be categorized as billboards currently erected along and visible from I-75 and more than 17 similarly defined signs currently erected along and visible from the primary highway systems which pass through the city. 
                  The mayor and city council find that the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city directly affect the public, health, safety, welfare and property values in the community. The mayor and city council find that signs can become excessive, and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, may be confusing to the public, and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the city and associated property values. The mayor and city council finds that there remains a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of these regulations contained in this Code. 
                  The purpose and intent of the mayor and city council in enacting the following regulations are as follows: 
                  (a)  To protect the health, safety, and general welfare and property values of the citizens of the city through the enactment of a comprehensive set of regulations governing signs in the city. 
                  (b)  To regulate the erection and placement of signs within the city in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unnecessary and unsafe distractions to drivers and pedestrians. 
                  (c)  To preserve the value of property on which signs are located and from which signs might be viewed. 
                  (d)  To maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the surrounding area. 
                  (e)  To maintain for the residents, workers, and visitors a safe and aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interests of the city. 
                  (f)  To establish comprehensive sign regulations that effectively balance legitimate business and developmental needs with safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors to Calhoun. 
                  (g)  To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for the identification of businesses that are located within the city and to provide for the identification of the availability of products, goods, or services to promote economic vitality. 
                  (h)  To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the State of Georgia and United States Constitutions within the city. 
                  (i)  To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts that are consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of the areas where the signs are to be located. 
                  (j)  To allow certain signs that are of appropriate size, safe, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this article but without a requirement for permits. 
                  (k)  To provide for temporary signs in certain circumstances. 
                  (l)  To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety, and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs. 
                  (m)  To prohibit all signs that are not expressly authorized by this article, to provide for the maintenance of signs, and to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this article.

                  (d)  Any sign or structure erected for the purpose of displaying a protected non-commercial message or protected non-commercial speech shall not be used for a commercial message or commercial speech unless such sign or structure is erected in conformance with all requirements of this ordnance and has received a sign permit as required by this ordinance. 
                  (e)  For purposes of this ordinance a "non-commercial message" or "non-commercial speech" shall mean any message or speech that does not meet the definition of "commercial message of commercial sign" as defined by subsection 10.2(18) of this ordinance. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a prosecution for violation of a criminal statute by the city or other duly constituted governmental authority or a civil action by the city or other private person or entity.

                  Section 10.4.6. - Variances. 
                  There shall be no deviation from the terms of this chapter, unless the mayor and city council, acting as a body, have granted a variance. Variances from the provisions of this chapter may be applied for and granted in the same procedural manner as variances from the city zoning ordinance. For a variance to be granted from this chapter, each of the following must be shown: 
                  (a)  No characteristics contrary to the public interest or this chapter will be promoted; 
                  (b)  No resulting variance shall create an effect or condition contrary to the public safety and welfare; 
                  (c)  Relief shall not impair the purposes of this chapter;

                  Note: Economic or financial hardship alone may not be sufficient to support the grant of a variance. Signs that are nonconforming as of the effective date of this chapter shall be granted automatic variance with no further action required on the part of permit holders. Variance procedures shall apply to new signs erected thereafter.

The costs of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sign's removal. 
                  When it is determined by the building inspector that said sign would cause an imminent danger to the public safety, and contact cannot be made with a sign owner or building owner, no written notice shall have to be served. In this emergency situation, the building inspector may correct the danger, all costs being charged to the sign owner and property owner. 
                  If it shall be necessary for the building inspector to remove a sign pursuant to the provisions hereof, and it should be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the aforesaid removal he may sell the same at private or public sale at the best price obtainable, and shall keep an account of the proceeds thereof.

In the event a sign is not removed after receipt of a removal order by the owner of such sign or property, the building inspector may institute legal proceeding hereunder against the property owner, sign owner, lessee, sign erector or a combination of the above. 
                  (l)  Civil actions. The city through the building inspector in his official capacity or any individual or entity whose property interests are directly affected may bring a civil action to seek injunctive and other relief to enforce this ordinance.

                  Section 10-A.1. - Findings and purposes. 
                  The mayor and council find that the provisions of the present zoning ordinance do not adequately address the placement of towers and antennas within the jurisdictional limits of the city; that the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996 allows the city to control the placement, construction and modification of communication towers; and that with the advent of enhanced technology the demand for personal communications services will cause an increased need for additional towers and transmission facilities within the jurisdictional limits of the city. The purpose of this ordinance is to balance the interests of the residents of the City of Calhoun, telecommunications providers, telecommunications customers, and developers of tower and antennas facilities in the siting of telecommunications facilities, towers and antennas within the City of Calhoun so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods by: 
                  1.  Providing for the appropriate location and development of tower facilities in such locations, which promote public safety and the general welfare and serve the residents and businesses of the city; 
                  2.  Minimizing, through proper siting, screening, and design the potential for visual blight and incompatibility and the proliferation of towers and antennas; 
                  3.  Promoting tower safety through proper engineering and siting; 
                  4.  Promoting and maximizing the shared use or collocation of new and existing towers; 
                  5.  Encouraging the use of existing structures for antennas locations as an alternative to the development of additional single use towers; and 
                  6.  Accommodating the increased demand for tower facility development.

The application shall state it is made to request a change of the then existing zoning where the applicant desires to place the tower to a zoning district to be designated as tower site as defined herein. The application will be reviewed and considered as a zoning decision and the procedures set forth in section 14.4 of this zoning ordinance of the City of Calhoun, Georgia, shall be applied and followed. In addition to those requirements contained elsewhere in this section X-A and the zoning ordinance of the City of Calhoun, Georgia, the zoning advisory board and the mayor and council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to approve or deny the rezoning request: 
                  1.  Height of proposed tower or antenna; 
                  2.  Proximity of the tower to residential structures, schools, day care centers, nursery schools, recreation areas, playgrounds, parks, hospitals and churches; 
                  3.  Nature of uses of adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  4.  Surrounding topography, tree coverage and foliage; 
                  5.  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing visual obtrusiveness; 
                  6.  Proximity to other antennas or towers; 
                  7.  Availability of suitable existing antennas or towers or other structures. 
                  In approving the rezoning request the mayor and council may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties. Should the rezoning request be denied, the decision shall be in writing supported by substantial evidence as contained in a written record of the proceedings. 
                  Section 10-A.5. - General requirements. 
                  The location and construction of towers governed by this ordinance shall comply with the following requirements: 
                  1.  Construction/inspections. 
                  a.  Towers shall be constructed and maintained in compliance with applicable building codes, industry standards, and standards for towers published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Tower owners shall be responsible for periodic written inspections of such towers at least every 12 months to ensure structural integrity. Such inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer with a current license issued by the State of Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be submitted to the building inspector and shall be maintained by the tower owner(s) and available for public review upon request. 
                  b.  If, upon inspection, the building inspector concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and poses a danger to persons or property, then upon written notice thereof to the owner, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance. Should the owner fail to bring the tower into compliance within 30 days, the city may remove such tower at the owner's expense pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-12. 
                  2.  Regulatory compliance. Tower owners shall annually certify in writing to the building inspector in January of each year that each tower is in compliance with standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owner(s) of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such tower or antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling agency. 
                  3.  Security. All towers, except alternative tower structures, shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an anti-climbing device. 
                  4.  Advertising. Except for the owner's identifying nameplate, advertising on towers shall be prohibited. Sign control, as set forth in article X of the City of Calhoun Zoning Ordinance, shall apply to any issues regarding signage. 
                  5.  Tower lighting. Illumination is prohibited on towers, except where required by the FCC or FAA, as necessary for air traffic safety. When illumination is required, documentation shall be provided with the application identifying the type of illumination required and any available alternatives. The mayor and council may review alternative permissible illumination and may approve the design causing the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  6.  Access. Access for maintenance vehicles shall be the right-of-way, which would most minimize interference with public traffic. Proposed sites which lack frontage on a public or private road shall provide an easement at least 20 feet wide with at least 12 feet graveled or paved travelway. 
                  7.  Hazardous/volatile substances. Use of a lot by a tower shall be prohibited when another principal use, on the same lot, includes the storage, distribution, or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such a propane, gasoline, natural gas, dangerous chemicals, or hazardous waste when such materials are not part of an emergency power source for the tower facilities. 
                  8.  Maintenance/operation structures. Maintenance/operation structures adjacent to any tower facility area shall be used only to house equipment and other supplies directly in support of the tower. Such structures shall not be used for offices, vehicle storage or for any continuous human occupation. Any equipment not used in direct support of a tower site shall not be stored on the site. 
                  9.  Historic sites. Tower facilities shall not be attached to or mounted to historically significant buildings, structures, or places identified by placement upon the National Register of Historic Places, by designation as a state historical site, by designation by the Gordon County Historical Society as a historic site, or as part of a locally designated historic district. 
                  10.  Setbacks and separations. All towers shall comply with the following standards, except that existing alternative tower structures are exempt from the minimum setback and separation requirements of this section; provided however, that such alternative tower structure must be a conforming use within the zoning district in which it is located for this setback exemption to apply as a matter of right. 
                  a.  All towers and antennas shall set back at least a distance equal to the height of the tower plus 15 feet, from any dwelling, zoning district line, or public property. 
                  b.  All towers and maintenance/operation structures (including guy wires) shall comply with the setbacks as required by the zoning district in which the tower is to be located. 
                  c.  The height limitations applicable to buildings in the zoning districts in which the tower or alternative tower structure is located shall not apply to such facilities or structures as a result of the tower or antenna. 
                  11.  Buffers and screening. 
                  a.  Tower sites shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials such that the view of the base of the tower is screened from any public rights-of-way, public property, and any R-1, R-1A, R-1B, R-2, R-2A, R-3, O-I and A-1 zoned property. 
                  b.  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, this landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether by the building inspector upon specific findings by the building inspector. 
                  c.  Existing mature growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited upon large, wooded lots, natural growth around the perimeter of the property may be sufficient if so determined by the building inspector upon specific findings by the building inspector. 
                  d.  In buffer construction, native vegetation shall be preserved to the fullest extent possible. 
                  12.  Visual impact. 
                  a.  Towers shall maintain a galvanized matte steel finish or be painted a natural, earth-toned color, unless otherwise required by the FAA. 
                  b.  The design of buildings and structures at the base of the tower facility to site shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping which create the greatest level of compatibility with the natural environment and existing land use patterns. 
                  c.  Antennas installed on an alternative tower structure and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment shall be of a natural color that is similar to or complements the color of the alternative tower structure. 
                  d.  Tower antennas shall be designed to be visually compatible with the exterior of the alternative tower structure to which they are to be attached. 
                  Section 10-A.6. - Shared use/collocation. 
                  New tower sites may not be permitted if there is an existing technically and commercially reasonable space available for shared use/collocation on preexisting towers and antennas or existing conforming towers and antennas. 
                  1.  The application for a permit to develop a tower shall demonstrate that no existing tower or alternative tower structure can accommodate the proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or alternative tower structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of any or all of the following: 
                  a.  Certificate [Certification] that no existing tower or alternative tower structures are located within the geographic area necessary to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  b.  Certification that existing tower or alternative tower structures have insufficient height and cannot be modified to accommodate the applicant's engineering requirements.

                  6.  Names and addresses or [of] lessees of the property; 
                  7.  Requested zoning classifications or variance and reason for change or need. 
                  Said applicant [application] shall be sworn to be true and correct and shall be signed by the landowner or authorized representative requesting the relief stated in the application. The application, along with a $20.00 nonrefundable fee, shall be presented to the City of Calhoun. The applicant shall mail a copy of said application to all present adjoining landowners who bound the property on all sides whether or not separated by any public or private street or road or natural boundary and any lessee of the property. Said application shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested and said proof of receipt shall be filed with the City of Calhoun prior to any public hearing called to consider said application. The written consent or [of] any adjoining landowner or lessee shall be accepted in lieu of postal receipt of notice. 
                  Section 14.5. - Standards for considering zoning decisions. 
                  The mayor and council of the City of Calhoun find that the increasing urbanization of this municipality requires that certain uniformity in procedures and standards be adopted to ensure that zoning decisions will be made consistently and wisely and in keeping with the long range requirements of the public health, safety and welfare. The mayor and council further find that the issues pertaining to annexation of territory to the municipality, zoning changes, and zoning variances within the municipality are commonly similar and therefore should be considered in the same manner at the municipal level subject only to the mandates of state and federal laws and regulations. The mayor and council further find that the procedures required by this ordinance will help the citizens of this municipality in presenting and articulating their viewpoints on zoning matters and will ensure that zoning matters are made on the basis of a record which will contain matters. 
                  The mayor and council, the zoning advisory board and the board of zoning appeals shall use the following standards when considering a zoning decision: 
                  Zoning standards: The term "zoning proposal" shall mean to include an annexation request, a rezoning request and a zoning variance request. 
                  1.  Whether the zoning proposal will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property. 
                  2.  Whether the zoning proposal will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property. 
                  3.  Whether the property to be affected by the zoning proposal has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned. 
                  4.  Whether the zoning proposal will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities or schools. 
                  5.  Whether there will be capital costs for capital improvements to serve the area. Capital costs shall include water mains, sewer mains, new street pavement or widening, new fire stations or equipment, new police stations or equipment, and other like costs. 
                  6.  Whether the zoning proposal is in conformity with the policy and intent of the land use plan. 
                  7.  Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for their approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal. 
                  8.  Whether there are other factors relevant to balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality or general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property. 
                  The foregoing zoning standards are guidelines and each zoning decision will present unique characteristics, so the guidelines set out in this ordinance are to be considered, but need not all be met for a zoning decision to be approved.
