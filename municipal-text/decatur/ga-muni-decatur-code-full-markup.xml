PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Decatur, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1967 Code, as supplemented through August 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1967 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Karen M. desIslets, City Clerk, and Mr. Thomas O. Davis, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  Section 11. - Same—Interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
                  Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter.

                  Section 14. - Same—Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of any city or county in the State of Georgia but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate any city or county in said state to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make an appropriation for their payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this Section. 
                  Section 15. - Same—Trust indenture as security.

Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, rents, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale, from time to time, of any surplus property of the Authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation repair and insurance of the property, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, including the proceeds derived from the sale of property of the Authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
                  Section 16. - Same—To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purpose hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.

The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in any trust indenture, but, except as indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in any trust indenture, surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. 
                  Section 18. - Same—Remedies of bondholders.

The judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, against the Authority issuing the same, and against any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia or the United States government, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the City of Decatur Parking Authority. 
                  Section 22. - Same—Interest or bondholders protected.

Each application form shall contain an explanation of the conditions to be met for approval and the conditions under which deferred taxes and interest become due, payable, and delinquent. Each application form shall clearly state that all deferrals pursuant to this Act shall constitute a lien on the applicant's homestead. 
                  (b)  A form of oath shall be provided and shall be administered to the individual seeking the deferral. The oath may be administered by the city clerk, any authorized deputy city clerk, or any individual authorized by law to administer oaths. 
                  (c)  (1) The city clerk shall consider each annual application for homestead tax deferral within 30 days of the date the application is filed or as soon as practicable thereafter. If the city clerk finds that the applicant is entitled to the tax deferral, the clerk shall approve the application and file the application in the permanent records. If the city clerk finds that the applicant is not entitled to the deferral, the clerk shall send a notice of disapproval to the applicant giving the reasons therefor within 30 days of the filing of the application either by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail to the mailing address given by the applicant, and the clerk shall make a return on the original notice of the manner in which the notice was served on the applicant and shall file the return among the permanent records of his office. The original notice of disapproval sent to the applicant shall advise the applicant of the applicant's right to appeal the decision of the city clerk to the local governing authority and shall inform the applicant of the procedure for filing an appeal. 
                  (2)  An appeal of the decision of the city clerk to the local governing authority shall be in writing on a form prescribed by the local governing authority and furnished by the city clerk. The appeal shall be filed with the local governing authority within 20 days after the applicant's receipt of the notice of disapproval.

The local governing authority shall reverse the decision of the city clerk and shall grant a homestead tax deferral to the applicant if in its judgment the applicant is entitled thereto, or it shall affirm the decision of the city clerk. Such action by the local governing authority shall be final unless the applicant, city clerk, or other lienholder files an appeal with the Superior Court of DeKalb County within 30 days from the date the taxpayer receives written notification of the decision of the local governing authority. 
                  (d)  Each application shall contain a list, and the current value, of all outstanding liens on the applicant's homestead. 
                  (e)  If proof of fire and extended coverage insurance has not been furnished with a prior application, each applicant shall furnish proof of such insurance in an amount which is in excess of the sum of all outstanding liens and deferred taxes and interest with a loss payable clause to the City of Decatur.

                  Section 7. - Taxes and interest constitute prior lien. 
                  The taxes and interest deferred pursuant to this Act shall constitute a prior lien and shall attach as of the date and in the same manner and shall be collected as are other liens for taxes, as provided for under Title 48 of the O.C.G.A., but the deferred taxes and interest shall only be due, payable, and delinquent as provided in this Act. 
                  Section 8. - Annual notification of owner of outstanding taxes and interest. 
                  Each year, at the time the tax bills are mailed, the city clerk shall notify each property owner to whom a homestead tax deferral has been previously granted of the accumulated sum of deferred taxes and interest outstanding. 
                  Section 9. - Conditions upon which taxes and interest are due and payable. 
                  (a)  In the event that there is a change in use of tax-deferred property so that the owner is no longer entitled to a homestead exemption for the property pursuant to Section 3 of this Act, or if the owner fails to maintain the required fire and extended insurance coverage, the total amount of deferred taxes and interest for all previous years shall be due and payable either on the date on which the change in use occurs or on the date failure to maintain insurance occurs. 
                  (b)  In the event that there is a change in ownership of tax-deferred property, the total amount of deferred taxes and interest for all previous years shall be due and payable on the date the change in ownership occurs. When, however, the change in ownership is to a surviving spouse and the spouse is eligible for a homestead exemption on the property pursuant to a resolution adopted by the 1981 General Assembly, H.R. 142 (1981 Ga. Laws, page 1914) and subsequently ratified as an amendment to the Constitution of the State of Georgia in the general election in 1982, the surviving spouse may continue the deferral of previously deferred taxes and interest pursuant to this Act. 
                  (c)  During any year in which the total amount of deferred taxes, interest, and all other unsatisfied liens on a homestead exceeds 85 percent of the fair market value of the homestead, the city clerk shall immediately notify the owner of the homestead that the portion of taxes and interest which exceeds 85 percent of the value of the homestead shall be due and payable within 30 days of receipt of the notice. Failure to pay the amount due shall cause the total amount of deferred taxes and interest also to become due and payable at the end of the 30 days. 
                  (d)  Each year, upon notification, each owner of property on which taxes and interest have been deferred shall submit to the city clerk a list, and the current value, of all outstanding liens on the owner's homestead. Failure to respond to the notification within 30 days of its receipt shall cause the total amount of deferred taxes and interest to become due and payable at the end of the 30 days. 
                  (e)  All deferred taxes which are made due and payable by this section shall be delinquent and subject to interest in accordance with Section 6 of this Act at the end of 120 days following the date the deferred taxes become due and payable. 
                  Section 10. - Method of payment. 
                  (a)  All or part of the deferred taxes and accrued interest may be paid at any time to the city clerk by: 
                  (1)  The owner of the property or the spouse of the owner; or 
                  (2)  The next of kin of the owner, heir of the owner, child of the owner, or any person having or claiming a legal or equitable interest in the property, provided that no objection is made by the owner within 30 days after the city clerk notifies the owner of the fact that such payment has been tendered. Any payment made under this paragraph shall be deposited in a special escrow account for the 30-day period; and the city clerk shall not make distribution of the payment while the funds are held in escrow. 
                  (b)  Any partial payment made pursuant to this section shall be applied first to accrued interest. By resolution of the city governing authority, a minimum amount of partial payment which may be accepted in the city pursuant to this Act may be established. 
                  Section 11. - Record of payment. 
                  When any deferred taxes or interest is collected, the city clerk shall maintain a record of the payment, which record shall contain a description of the property and the amount of taxes or interest collected for the property. The city clerk shall distribute payments received to the local tax jurisdictions to whom the taxes and interest are owed. 
                  Section 12. - Right of foreclosure. 
                  If any holder of a deed to secure debt or any mortgagee elects to pay the taxes of an applicant who qualifies for and receives a tax deferral, such election shall not give the holder of the deed or the mortgagee the right to foreclose. 
                  Section 13. - Collection of personal property taxes. 
                  Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent the collection of personal property taxes which become a lien against tax-deferred property. 
                  Section 14. - Penalties for filing false information. 
                  (a)  The following penalties shall be imposed on any person who willfully files information required under Sections 3 and 9 which is incorrect: 
                  (1)  The person shall pay the total amount of taxes and interest deferred, which amount shall immediately become due; 
                  (2)  The person shall be disqualified from filing a homestead tax deferral application for the next three years; and 
                  (3)  The person shall pay a penalty of 25 percent of the total amount of taxes and interest deferred. 
                  (b)  Any person against whom the penalties prescribed in this section have been imposed may appeal the penalties imposed to the local governing authority within 30 days after the penalties are imposed.

                  Sec. 1-8. - Amendments to Code; effect of new ordinances; amendatory language. 
                  (a)  All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code of Ordinances which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code of Ordinances may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion in this Code. In the case of the repeal of chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code of Ordinances and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code of Ordinances by the city commission. 
                  (b)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: "That section _____ of the Code of Ordinances, City of Decatur, Georgia, is hereby amended to read as follows:…."

                  (a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared on an annual basis. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city commission during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
                  (b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
                  (c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-10. - Altering Code. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby. Any person violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-12.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. O-16-13, adopted Oct. 17, 2016, set out provisions intended for use as § 2-5. To maintain a consistent style for this Code, this section has been codified as Art. II, Div. 1, § 2-31, Div. 2, §§ 2-36—2-46, Div. 3, §§ 2-50—2-53, Div. 4, §§ 2-56—2-58, as herein set out, at the discretion of the editor. 

                  DIVISION 1. - BASIS FOR CODE 

                  Sec. 2-31. - Foundation. 
                  The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use public office in order to improve his or her own private standing. The principal policies which form the foundation of this code of ethics are: 
                  (a)  Public trust in the integrity of government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity. 
                  (b)  In speaking about the conduct of those in public service, or in responding to others who speak about it, express approval of positive ethical principles and behavior and refrain from unjustly despairing or demeaning those who advocate ethical principles or practice ethical behavior. 
                  (c)  Recognize that the most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act ethically and to consistently react appropriately with respect to the ethical decisions of others. 
                  (d)  Exercise sound judgment to act ethically in situations where others may be inclined to act unethically. 
                  (Ord. No. O-16-13, Art. I, § I, 10-17-16) 
                  Secs. 2-32—2-35. - Reserved. 
                  DIVISION 2. - GENERAL 

                  Sec. 2-36. - Intent. 
                  It is the intent of this code of ethics that a city commissioner shall not knowingly engage in any activity which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties or which would tend to impair his or her judgment or actions in the performance of his or her official duties. Furthermore, city commissioners should avoid any action, which might result in or create the appearance of the following: 
                  (a)  Using public office for private gain. 
                  (b)  Impeding city efficiency or economy. 
                  (c)  Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of the city. 
                  (Ord. No. O-16-13, Art. B, § I, 10-17-16) 
                  Sec. 2-37. - Definitions. 
                  (a)  Admonishment shall mean a statement of disapproval, used to express displeasure with actions that technically violate this code of ethics but that do not involve intentional acts or omissions or direct private gain, and that typically involve an appearance of impropriety rather than actual impropriety. 
                  (b)  Benefit shall mean: 
                  (1)  Anything regardless of its monetary value, perceived or intended by either the one who offers it or the one to whom it is offered, to be sufficient in value to influence a city commissioner in the performance or non-performance of an official action; or, 
                  (2)  Anything, regardless of its monetary value, which, under the circumstances, a reasonably prudent person would recognize as being likely to be intended to influence a city commissioner in the performance or non-performance of an official action. 
                  (c)  Censure shall mean a stern condemnation, reserved for the most egregious violations of this code of ethics, which involve intentional acts and private gain and which result in a significant erosion of the public trust in the city government. 
                  (d)  City commissioner shall mean any person who is an elected city official, including any person who has been elected but whose term of office has not started. 
                  (e)  Complainant shall mean a person who files a complaint alleging a violation of this code of ethics. 
                  (f)  Employee shall mean any person who is employed in a position covered by the position classification plan of the City of Decatur; any person who is employed part-time by any operating department of the city; and any person who is employed through a contractual agreement with the city. 
                  (g)  Government or city shall mean the City of Decatur, Georgia. 
                  (h)  Interest shall mean any direct or indirect financial gain accruing to a member of the city commission as a result of a contract or transaction that is, or may be, the subject of an official act or action by, or with, the city. "Interest" shall not mean any direct or indirect financial gain which is remote or insignificant. 
                  (i)  Reprimand shall mean a formal rebuke, used for mid-level violations of this code of ethics that involve intentional or reckless acts or omissions and/or direct or indirect private gain. 
                  (j)  Respondent shall mean a city commissioner who is the subject of a complaint filed pursuant to this code of ethics.

                  (1)  Have a direct or indirect financial interest that conflicts with his or her responsibilities and duties as a trustee of the public good. 
                  (2)  Either directly or indirectly engage in financial transactions as a result of, or primarily relying upon, information obtained in the course of his or her office or received due to his or her position. 
                  (b)  A city commissioner shall be deemed to have a financial interest in transactions involving the following:

                  (2)  Any person with whom a contractual relationship exists whereby the city commissioner may receive any payment or other benefits. 
                  (3)  Any business in which the city commissioner is a director, officer, employee, agent, or shareholder.

Likewise, a complaint alleging a violation of the code of ethics by a newly elected city commissioner shall not be accepted for filing until after the election results are certified.

                  (l)  Compliance with timeframes. A schedule of deadlines is set forth in this section in order to ensure the timely disposition of complaints—for the benefit of complainants, respondents, and the public. General compliance is expected, but failure to strictly comply with every deadline shall not invalidate an otherwise valid complaint or otherwise deprive the ethics committee and the city commission of their authority to adjudicate violations of this code of ethics. 
                  (m)  Legal counsel. The ethics committee shall be advised and assisted in carrying out its responsibilities by the city attorney and/or such other attorney or attorneys authorized by the city manager. 
                  (n)  Administrative support. The ethics committee shall be assisted in carrying out its responsibilities by the city manager and/or the city manager's designee(s).

Because of the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential to the extent allowed by the Georgia Open Records Act. The police chief or his/her designee shall have a search made relative to any police record of the person fingerprinted. In no event shall any alcoholic beverage server permit be granted to any persons who have been convicted under any federal, state, or local law or have pleaded guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime, misdemeanor, or felony involving moral turpitude, lottery, or illegal possession or sale of narcotics or liquors within a period of five years immediately prior to the filing of such application, nor shall any person sell or dispense alcoholic beverages.

If the person requests consideration by the city manager, the entire record will be sent. The city manager or his/her designee shall consider all matters presented and make a decision as to whether the person qualifies for an alcoholic beverage server permit under this chapter. In the event the city manager or his/her designee denies the permit, written notice shall be provided of the denial to the applicant.

                  (h)  This section shall not be construed to include employees whose duties are limited solely to those of busboys, cooks, dishwashers or similar jobs that do not involve selling or serving or controlling the selling or serving of alcoholic beverages. 
                  (i)  Except as provided in this section, no licensee shall allow any employee required to hold an alcoholic beverage server permit to work on the licensed premises unless the licensee has on file, on the premises, the current, valid alcoholic beverage server permit of each such employee. 
                  (j)  If any alcoholic beverage server permit holder leaves the employ of a licensed establishment, the licensee shall immediately surrender the alcoholic beverage server permit to the police department.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 10-51. - Findings of fact. 
                  Based on the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Atlanta, Georgia; Fulton County, Georgia; and DeKalb County, Georgia; which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the city, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the city commission that public nudity, either partial or total, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called nude bars or establishments offering so-called nude entertainment or adult entertainment, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, drug trafficking and drug use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this section, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Furthermore, the public health, safety and welfare require that adult entertainment establishments and their locations, operations and employees be regulated and licensed in order to reduce the potential for harm and in order to preserve the quality of urban life in residential and business areas of the community. Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the city is in the public welfare, and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

                  Sec. 10-52. - Purpose of article. 
                  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses; the adverse affect on property values and on the public health, safety, and welfare of the city; on its citizens and property; and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business establishment or activity which would otherwise be unlawful.

                  (b)  Applicability. This article shall apply to all public and private property within the City of Decatur, Georgia. 
                  (c)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
                  (d)  Severability. If the provisions of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be judged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such order or judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article.

This two-foot-wide area may have the pavement removed and be developed as part of the required landscaped area. 
                  (4)  Surface parking lots shall have a minimum landscaped area equal to at least ten percent of the paved area within such lot. In no case shall a parking lot owner be required to provide landscaped areas that exceed ten percent of the paved area.

                  (14)  Notwithstanding subsection (13) above, existing parking lots shall not be required to reduce the number of parking spaces by more than three percent as a result of implementing these landscaping regulations. 
                  (15)  Upon written application by any person subject to the provisions of this section, the city manager and/or his/her designee is hereby authorized to grant administrative variances to the requirements of this section only upon making all of the following findings: 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, topography, subsurface conditions, overhead structures, or the existence of sufficient trees in the public right-of-way within ten feet of the property line; 
                  b.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
                  c.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this article.

The notice shall also state the location where the impounded motor vehicle will be stored and the place where the owner may make the request for the hearing. The notice shall also state that failure by the owner to request a hearing within five days of receipt of the notice may act as a waiver of the right to a hearing and that this may result in the placing of a lien against the motor vehicle for the towing and storage charges without further notice to the owner. The owner of the impounded vehicle shall sign the notice as an acknowledgment that a copy has been received, and a copy of the notice shall be provided to the owner. 
                  (b)  When a police officer impounds and removes a motor vehicle pursuant to section 98-111(1) or (2) and the owner or the person with the right of possession of the motor vehicle is not present at the time of the impoundment, notice containing the same language as required in subsection (a) of this section shall be served, within five days from the date of impoundment, upon the owner by posting such notice in the United States mail with sufficient postage to ensure its delivery to the address shown for the owner in the motor vehicle registration records of the state in which the motor vehicle is registered. 
                  (c)  If a person required by this section to sign a notice of impoundment willfully fails or refuses to do so, the police officer shall note this fact on the face of the notice which shall constitute prima facie evidence of delivery or service of notice as required by this section.

If the clerk of court is satisfied that the person making the request is the owner or authorized agent of the owner, the clerk of court shall provide a release to the owner or authorized agent, and, upon the presenting of this release and the payment of accrued towing and storage charges to the custodian of the motor vehicle, the custodian shall release the motor vehicle. 
                  (b)  If the owner of the motor vehicle requests a hearing, such request shall be made to the clerk of court of the municipal court and the clerk of court shall schedule the hearing in the municipal court.

If good cause cannot be shown, the judge shall dismiss the hearing and make the finding stated in subsection (d)(2) of this section; otherwise, the judge shall proceed to hear the owner's objections. 
                  (d)  At the conclusion of the hearing on the owner's objections, the judge shall render a decision. 
                  (1)  If the judge finds that the impoundment was improper, the judge shall:

                  b.  Determine whether and to what extent the city shall bear the expense of the towing and storage charges. 
                  (2)  If the judge finds that the impoundment was proper, the judge shall establish:

                  1.4.1. - Establishment of Comprehensive Land Use Plan 
                  A.  The Comprehensive Land Use Plan is established as the official policy of the City, Georgia, concerning proposed land uses and how land in the City should be used. The City is hereby divided into the following land use categories: 

                   
                  B.  The Comprehensive Land Use Plan does not alter or affect the existing zoning districts in the City, does not effectuate an amendment to the Zoning District Map, and does not itself permit or prohibit any existing land uses. 
                  1.4.2. - Land Use Districts 
                  A.  The boundaries of the various land use districts are shown upon the map designated as the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. 
                  B.  The Comprehensive Land Use Plan and all notations, references and other information are hereby made a part of this UDO and have the same force and effect as if the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and all the notations, references and other information shown thereon were all fully set forth or described herein, which Comprehensive Land Use Plan is properly attested and is on file with the city clerk of the City, Georgia. 
                  C.  All other writings concerning the Comprehensive Land Use Plan are for guidance and informational purposes only, and are not a part of this UDO. 
                  1.4.3. - Interpretation of Land Use District Boundaries 
                  Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any of the land use districts shown on the Comprehensive Land Use Plan, the rules set forth in Sec. 1.3.2. apply. 
                  1.4.4. - Relationship Between Land Use Categories and Zoning Districts 
                  The land use categories established by the Comprehensive Land Use Plan may be implemented by the establishment of appropriate zoning districts within each category. The zoning districts that are permitted within each land use category are restricted to the following: 

                   
                  Article 2. - Rules of Interpretation 
                  Sec. 2.1. - Rules Applicable to All Districts 

                  2.1.1. - Conformity to District Requirements 
                  A.  Every building erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered shall be located on a lot except as approved by the City Commission under Sec. 5.4. In no case shall more than one principal building be located on a lot except as otherwise provided for in this UDO. 
                  B.  The minimum yards, parking spaces and open spaces required by this UDO for each building existing at the time of passage of this UDO, or for any building erected or structurally altered after the passage of this UDO, shall not be encroached upon or considered as part of the yard or parking space or open space required for any other structure, nor shall any lot area be reduced below the minimum lot area for the district in which the lot is located. 
                  C.  No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in conformity with the lot area, floor area, and building height regulations of the district in which the building is located. 
                  2.1.2. - Density 
                  A.  Net Site Area   
                  1.  Net site area is determined by subtracting publicly-dedicated land, from the gross site area. 
                  2.  Land area set aside for common open space or recreational use is included in net site area for the purpose of determining the maximum number of dwelling units. Poor drainage areas or other areas of rough terrain as to constitute land which is economically unbuildable may be counted as common open space but may not be counted as space for active recreational areas. 
                  B.  Dwelling Units Allowed   
                  1.  The maximum number of dwelling units allowed on a site is calculated by multiplying the net site area by the maximum number of units per acre allowed in the district. 
                  2.  Minimum lot sizes may appear to allow additional units to be developed on a site; however, the district's allowed density serves as the cap on the maximum number of units on a site. 
                  2.1.3. - Amenity Space 
                  A.  Amenity space is common area and may not be designated for the use of any specific tenant or group of tenants. The space may be restricted to use by residents, tenants and their visitors only, or made available to the general public, at the applicant's discretion. 
                  B.  Where required, amenity space must be met in one contiguous open area or in multiple open areas on the site; however, to receive credit, the area must be at least 10 feet in width and length, and at least 50% of the required amenity space must be located in one contiguous open area. 
                  C.  Amenity space must remain unenclosed on all sides, but up to 50% of the total provided amenity space may be covered. 
                  D.  Amenity space may be located at or above grade. 
                  E.  In calculating the required amenity space, the following listed facilities, and any similar facilities, may be included: 
                  1.  Ground-level facilities such as a swimming pool, playground, sport court, dog park, garden, community, garden, park, green, pavilion, outdoor dining, seating area or plaza. 
                  2.  Upper-level facilities such as a shared or common balcony, rooftop deck or rooftop garden. 
                  2.1.4. - Lot Coverage 
                  A.  Where a lot of record in R-50 or R-60 at the time of the effective date of this UDO had less than the required minimum lot area, the maximum lot coverage is as follows: 

                   
                  The lot coverage of properties developed with existing single-family dwellings where the existing lot coverage exceeds the maximum lot coverage permitted may be modified as long as the proposed lot coverage does not exceed the existing lot coverage. 
                  2.1.5. - Yards 
                  A.  General Yard Standards   
                  1.  Every part of a required yard shall be open to the sky and unobstructed except for the ordinary projections of sills, belt courses, cornices, eaves, chimneys, buttresses and other ornamental and architectural features; provided, however, that such features do not project more than 1½ feet into any required yard. 
                  2.  A deck or patio may project into a required side yard to a point not closer than 5 feet from any side lot line.

                  6.  Where a lot of record in an R-60 zoning district at the time of the effective date of this UDO had less than the required minimum lot width, one of the minimum required side yards may be reduced by ½ foot for each foot that the lot width is less than 60 feet, under the following conditions: 
                  a.  There is a minimum distance of 10 feet between the dwelling and the principal building on the property adjacent to the reduced side yard. 
                  b.  No side yard may be reduced below a minimum of 5 feet.

                  C.  Front Yard Reduction   
                  The Zoning Administrator is authorized to allow a reduction in the minimum front yard requirement for the main dwelling under the following conditions: 
                  1.  Where there is an existing dwelling with a covered entryway. 
                  a.  The existing covered entryway does not meet the present minimum front yard requirement. 
                  b.  The proposed renovation or repair will maintain the existing front yard setback or will result in a reduction of the front yard of 2 feet or less. 
                  c.  The proposed renovation or repair will not result in a change to the elevation of the front door or the finished floor of the stoop, porch or first floor. 
                  d.  The project is not determined to be a demolition or substantial improvement. Enlargements or extensions of dwellings that are defined as substantial improvements must be extended in conformity with the development standards in the applicable zoning district.

                  3.8.2. - Purpose 
                  A.  To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure. 
                  B.  To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land. 
                  C.  To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat. 
                  D.  To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development. 
                  E.  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development. 
                  F.  To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community.

                  I.  To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries. 
                  J.  To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles. 
                  K.  To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space. 
                  L.  To preserve important historic and archaeological sites. 
                  3.8.3. - General Regulations 
                  A.  Applicability   
                  This conservation subdivision option is available in the R-85 and R-60 zoning districts. Applicants shall comply with all other provisions of the Unified Development Ordinance and all other applicable laws. Approval of a conservation subdivision is also subject to the requirements of Sec. 11.2.5. 
                  B.  Ownership of Development Site   
                  The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility. 
                  C.  Housing Density Determination   
                  The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator: 
                  1.  Calculation   
                  The maximum number of dwelling units allowed on a site is calculated by multiplying the net site area by the maximum number of units per acre allowed in the district. Where a conservation subdivision is proposed, the net site area must be reduced to exclude all of the following areas: 
                  a.  Slopes over 15% of at least 2,500 square feet contiguous area;

                  A.  Purpose   
                  The purpose of the mixed-use district is to promote the redevelopment of existing single uses in commercial areas into vibrant and sustainable mixed-use communities combining residential, retail and office uses; to promote diversity in housing and commercial options; to create walkable, pedestrian-scaled environments that accommodate and encourage multiple modes of transportation; to provide opportunities to add a variety of open space amenities; to provide a framework for shared infrastructure; and to improve the quality of life by providing live, work, and play opportunities based on regulating master site plans developed for a specific area. 
                  B.  Establishing a Mixed-Use District   
                  1.  No MU mixed-use district shall be established without the concurrent approval of a Regulating Master Site Plan by the City Commission following public review and recommendation by city staff and the Planning Commission. 
                  2.  The boundaries of each mixed-use district shall be as shown on the Zoning District Map and Comprehensive Land Use Plan and shall correspond with the adopted Regulating Master Site Plan. 
                  3.  Once adopted, a Regulating Master Site Plan may be modified only after a hearing by the Planning Commission and approval of the City Commission; provided that modifications which do not change the mix or intensity of approved uses, the location or height of buildings, or other significant site features (including, but not limited to, location of streets, drives, parking structures, public spaces) may be approved administratively by the Zoning Administrator. Alterations to the streets and open spaces delineated on a Regulating Plan may be authorized by the Zoning Administrator, upon a finding by the Zoning Administrator that:

                  1.  Review Jurisdiction   
                  "Review jurisdiction" defines what aspects of the physical appearance of the district are subject to the review of the commission and the limits of that review power. All projects are subject to the full review of the Historic Preservation Commission unless they fall outside of the "review jurisdiction" as defined in this article or they qualify for administrative review and certificate of exemption as defined in Sec. 5.2.8.D.2. of these guidelines standards. 
                  a.  As described in its district designation, the primary value of the Clairemont Avenue District is in the public experience of the district as a historic residential corridor into the heart of downtown Decatur. The preservation of the historic character, as visible from Clairemont Avenue, is the primary goal of this district. Therefore: 
                  i.  The review jurisdiction of the Historic Preservation Commission shall extend only to material changes to the front and side facades of principal or accessory structures that would be visible from the Clairemont Avenue public right-of-way. 
                  ii.  Due to their temporary and non-historic nature, privacy fences and/or vegetation, that might obscure otherwise visible changes, do not remove projects from the review jurisdiction. 
                  iii.  The Historic Preservation Commission or its designated staff member may only make the determination of what is visible from the Clairemont Avenue public right-of-way. 
                  b.  Only proposed material changes to the exterior of the front and side facades of properties within the historic district, that would be legally required to obtain a building permit with the exception of tree removals, must be submitted to the Historic Preservation Commission or its designated staff person to determine if the project is subject to review, and if so, the level of review required. 
                  c.  An application for a building permit for a property within the historic district will commence the review process of the project by the Historic Preservation Commissions' designee designated staff person for a determination of the project's status under these guidelines standards.

                  2.  Certificates of Exemption   
                  In an effort to expedite the review process for the Clairemont Avenue Historic District it has been determined that certain changes to properties will be eligible for a certificate of exemption. The certificate of exemption certifies the approval of the Historic Preservation Commission for a change to be made other than a material change as defined in these guidelines standards. The Historic Preservation Commission, its designated City staff member shall be authorized to provide for this administrative level of review and the issuance of the certificate of exemption for projects requiring a building permit.

                  5.4.2. - Permitted Uses; Minimum Areas 
                  Planned unit developments may be allowed in all zoning districts except the RS-17 and R-50 Districts. However, only those uses permitted in the zoning district in which the proposed development is located shall be permitted in the planned unit development. Except in the R-85 and R-60 Zoning Districts, a planned unit development shall have a minimum area of at least one acre. In the R-85 and R-60 Zoning Districts, a planned unit development shall have a minimum area of at least 2 acres. 
                  5.4.3. - Density Standards 
                  The number of dwelling units permitted in a planned unit development in any residential zoning district shall be determined by dividing the net development area by the minimum lot area per dwelling for the zoning district in which the proposed planned unit development is located, as described in the table below. Lot sizes permitted in planned unit developments may be smaller than the minimum lot size required in the zoning district in which the planned unit development is located. 

                   
                  5.4.4. - Development Standards

                  Walkways shall form a logical, safe and convenient system for pedestrian access to all dwelling units and other buildings and facilities. Walkways to be used by substantial numbers of children shall be so located and safeguarded as to minimize contacts with normal automotive traffic. Walkways that are appropriately located, designed and constructed may be combined with other easements and used by emergency and service vehicles, but shall not be used by other automotive traffic. 
                  E.  Light, Air and Recreation   
                  The planned unit development shall be so designed as to provide adequate improvements for the light, air and recreation needs of the project when fully developed. A minimum of 5% of the planned unit development site area must be designated as outdoor amenity space (see Sec. 2.1.3.) 
                  F.  Covenants   
                  The planned unit development shall include such covenants and legal provisions as will assure conformity to the achievement of the plan. 
                  G.  General Standards for Approval   
                  Planned unit developments may be approved subject to such conditions as may be imposed in order to mitigate impacts which may be expected without the imposition of conditions. The following general standards shall be considered in determining whether the planned unit development shall be approved: 
                  1.  Is the proposed development suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property? 
                  2.  Does the proposed development adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property? 
                  3.  Does the proposed development result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities or schools? 
                  4.  Are there other existing or changing conditions which, because of their impact on the public health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the proposed development? 
                  5.4.5. - Application for Approval 
                  A.  Ownership

However, no building permit shall be issued until the applicant provides satisfactory evidence of ownership of an interest in the property. 
                  B.  Procedure   
                  An application for approval of a planned unit development shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator at least 30 days prior to the date on which it is to be heard by the Planning Commission.

                  6.1.1. - Classification of Uses 
                  No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved, structurally altered or used, except for a use permitted in the district in which the building is located. 
                  A.  Principal Uses   
                  1.  In order to regulate a variety of similar uses, use categories have been established for principal uses. Use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning uses to appropriate categories with other, similar uses. Use categories classify principal uses and activities based on common functional, product or physical characteristics. 
                  2.  Where a use category contains a list of included uses, the list is to be considered example uses, and not all-inclusive. The Zoning Administrator is responsible for categorizing uses as set out in Sec. 6.1.2. 
                  3.  The allowed use table in Sec. 6.2. establishes permitted uses by district. No land shall be used except for a purpose permitted in the district in which it is located.

                  B.  Accessory Uses   
                  1.  An accessory use is any use that is subordinate in both purpose and size, incidental to and customarily associated with a permitted principal use located on the same lot. 
                  2.  No accessory use or structure shall be located, constructed or moved upon a lot until the construction of the main building has commenced. No accessory structure shall be used unless the main building is in use. 
                  3.  Standards for accessory uses are specified in Sec. 6.8. 
                  C.  Temporary Uses   
                  1.  A temporary use is a use that is in place for a limited period of time only. 
                  2.  Requirements for temporary uses are specified in Sec. 6.9. 
                  6.1.2. - Principal Uses Not Listed 
                  A principal use not specifically listed is not allowed unless the Zoning Administrator determines the use to be part of a use category as described below. 
                  A.  The Zoning Administrator is responsible for categorizing all principal uses. If a proposed use is not listed in a use category, but is similar to a listed use, the Zoning Administrator may consider the proposed use part of that use category. When determining whether a proposed use is similar to a listed use, the Zoning Administrator must consider the following criteria: 
                  1.  The actual or projected characteristics of the proposed use; 
                  2.  The relative amount of site area or floor area and equipment devoted to the proposed use; 
                  3.  Relative amounts of sales; 
                  4.  The customer type; 
                  5.  The relative number of employees; 
                  6.  Hours of operation; 
                  7.  Building and site arrangement; 
                  8.  Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements; 
                  9.  The number of vehicle trips generated; 
                  10.  How the proposed use is advertised; 
                  11.  The likely impact on surrounding properties; and 
                  12.  Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site. 
                  B.  Where a use not listed is found by the Zoning Administrator not to be similar to any other permitted use, the use is only permitted following a text amendment.

                  Shared parking privileges are conditioned upon and shall continue in effect only as long as the use for which shared parking is utilized has legally enforceable access to the required amount of shared parking. 
                  3.  Calculations   
                  a.  Where a shared parking arrangement is proposed, the UDO Administrator shall determine the number of parking spaces that may be shared based on a shared parking application prepared by the applicant.

                  i.  Identify the properties and uses for the application; 
                  ii.  Determine the number of parking spaces that would be required by applying the standard for the uses for all of the properties; and 
                  iii.  Determine the peak parking demand for the combined demand of all of the uses for all of the properties in the application using the Decatur parking occupancy rates spreadsheet. 
                  c.  Shared parking is only available for complementary uses with disparate parking demands. 
                  d.  The UDO Administrator may use the lesser of the 2 parking demands calculated in Sec. 7.1.5.G.3.b. above as the minimum number of parking spaces to be provided for all the properties and uses addressed in the application. 
                  e.  The Decatur parking occupancy rate spread-sheet is not an exhaustive list of land uses. If shared parking ratios in the Decatur parking occupancy rate spreadsheet are not available for the type of use the applicant is applying for the applicant may provide data collected at similar sites to establish local parking demand rates. 

                   
                  4.  Shared Parking Agreement

A copy of any amended, renewed, replacement or successor agreement shall be filed with the UDO Administrator within a reasonable amount of time following execution. Where a shared parking application includes 2 or more properties owned by the same person or entity, a sworn, notarized statement shall be submitted to the UDO Administrator, representing that, in the event of any change in ownership of any of the participating properties, a written, legally binding agreement providing for the continued shared use of parking (guaranteeing access to, use of, and management of designated parking spaces), will be entered into with subsequent owners and a copy provided to the UDO Administrator, with copies of all amended, renewed, replacement or successor agreements filed with the UDO Administrator within a reasonable amount of time following execution. 
                  b.  On a periodic basis, not less than biennially, the UDO Administrator shall review all allowed shared parking arrangements to ensure compliance with the guaranteed access to shared parking requirements set forth above. 
                  5.  Shared Parking Plan

                  A.  Curbing or barrier blocks must be installed around the perimeter of parking lots and required landscaped areas to prevent vehicle encroachment onto adjacent property, rights-of-way and landscaped areas, except abutting a building or structure and at points of ingress and egress into the facility. Curbing may have openings to allow drainage to enter and percolate through landscaped areas. 
                  B.  Curbing or barrier blocks must be a minimum of 6 inches in height and a minimum of 8 inches in width. Curbing must be concrete or stone, securely installed, and maintained in good condition. 
                  C.  Where the end of a parking space abuts a landscaped area, curbing or barrier blocks may be placed in the parking space at a maximum of 2 feet from the end of the parking space. This 2-foot-wide area may have the pavement removed and be developed as part of the required landscaped area. 

                  D.  Surface parking lots shall have a minimum landscaped area equal to at least 10% of the paved area within such lot. In no case shall a parking lot owner be required to provide landscaped areas that exceed 10% of the paved area.

                  L.  All landscaped areas, including trees located in the public right-of-way that are counted in the fulfillment of this requirement, shall be properly maintained in accordance with approved landscape plans. In the event that a tree or any plant material dies, it shall be replaced within 6 months so as to meet all requirements of this Section and to allow for planting in the appropriate planting season. 
                  M.  If it is determined by the City arborist that implementation of these regulations will result in the loss of parking spaces in existing lots, the UDO Administrator may increase the allowable percentage compact car spaces from 25% up to 35% so as to minimize the loss of parking spaces. 
                  N.  Notwithstanding Sec. 7.2.4.M. above, existing parking lots shall not be required to reduce the number of parking spaces by more than 3% as a result of implementing these landscaping regulations. 
                  O.  Upon written application by any person subject to the provisions of this Section, the Zoning Administrator is hereby authorized to grant administrative variances to the requirements of this Section only upon making all of the following findings: 
                  1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, topography, subsurface conditions, overhead structures, or the existence of sufficient trees in the public right-of-way within 10 feet of the property line; 
                  2.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
                  3.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this article. 
                  Sec. 7.3. - Signs 

                  7.3.1. - Preamble and Purpose 
                  A.  In order to protect the public safety, to protect the tranquil environment, to protect community aesthetics, to protect the public investment in streets and highways, to promote commerce and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of the citizens of the City, it is hereby determined that the public health, safety and welfare require the adoption of this Section. 
                  B.  The purpose of this Section is to recognize that although signs and advertising are necessary, they should be reasonably regulated in the interest of protecting the public health, safety, welfare, environment and community aesthetics by the establishment of standards for location, size, illumination, number, construction and maintenance of all signs and advertising structures and for the prohibition of certain signs and advertising structures in the City. 
                  C.  The City further finds that the rights of persons to convey messages through signs and protection of First Amendment and other constitutional rights must be balanced with other important public interests such as traffic safety hazards, protecting property values, and restricting visual clutter that results in safety dangers as well as degradation of the City's important interests in protecting and enhancing its aesthetic environment. The City finds that regulation of the location, size, placement and design of signs through the following regulations is necessary to protect these public interests, particularly with regard to traffic and pedestrian safety as well as aesthetics, in an appropriate and balanced manner.

                  Article 9. - Environmental Protection 
                  Sec. 9.1. - Tree Protection 

                  9.1.1. - Intent 
                  A.  The purposes of these regulations are to encourage the conservation of existing tree canopy and provide minimum requirements for the protection, maintenance and renewal of tree canopy cover across the City. The City believes that trees are an essential part of the community's infrastructure and recognizes that they provide measurable and valuable services and benefits to our community. These services and benefits include: 
                  1.  Improved health of Decatur's citizens and visitors; 
                  2.  Improved air quality; 
                  3.  Improved water quality; 
                  4.  Improved soil quality; 
                  5.  Stormwater control; 
                  6.  Energy conservation; 
                  7.  Increased property values; 
                  8.  Habitat for desirable wildlife; 
                  9.  Noise and glare buffering; 
                  10.  Privacy screening; 
                  11.  Increased community aesthetics and quality of life; and 
                  12.  Increased shade for active living activities like walking, and biking. 
                  B.  The City recognizes that trees and tree canopy are a community resource that requires active conservation and replanting efforts. The purpose of these regulations is to provide a basic framework for maintaining, conserving and increasing tree canopy cover across the City. The City's tree canopy cover will be measured every 5 years. Previous measurements of tree canopy showed 45.7% tree canopy cover in 2005 and 45.1% tree canopy cover in 2010. The next measurement will be made in 2014 of the 2014 tree canopy cover, and then every 5 years thereafter of the previous year's cover. 
                  9.1.2. - Review 
                  A.  Tree Permits   
                  Tree permits are required in Article 9. (see Sec. 9.1.17.). 
                  B.  Administrative Standards   
                  Administrative standards that provide detailed information on how this Section shall be administered and implemented are hereby established and included in a supplemental document made a part of this Section by reference. The City Arborist may waive or modify administrative standards based on site or tree conditions, property owner circumstances, or for the incorporation of alternative green technologies on a site. 
                  9.1.3. - Tree Species List 
                  There is hereby established a City Tree Species List that is included in the administrative standards and is hereinafter referred to as the tree species list. 
                  9.1.4. - Applicability and Exemptions 
                  A.  This Section applies to any and all real property within the City limits, including all public and private property and all zoning districts and to all protected trees growing within the City limits. 
                  B.  No protected tree shall be intentionally removed, destroyed, or disturbed without the written consent of the City Arborist in the form of an approved tree conservation plan, tree disturbance permit, tree removal permit or tree information permit as shown in the Table below. 

                   
                  C.  The following activities and trees are exempt from compliance with this Section: 
                  1.  Activities or trees included in approved community forest management plans, annual work plans, memoranda of understanding or other plans and agreements approved by the City Arborist or executed between the City and government entities, utility companies, public authorities, boards or commissions. 
                  2.  Activities or trees described in a waiver issued by the City Manager during and immediately after the period of an emergency such as a flood, ice storm, thunderstorm, windstorm, tornado, or any other disastrous act of nature. 
                  3.  Activities or trees on any portion of a property included within the limits of a valid site development permit issued prior to July 7, 2014, provided that all time constraints relating to the permit are observed. 
                  4.  In a case where a tree has been determined by a Certified Arborist to be at moderate to high risk of failure or to have a high or extreme risk rating that cannot otherwise be mitigated or to be in such a dangerous condition that it is threatening public health, safety or welfare or threatens to cause imminent harm to a building or other infrastructure and requires immediate removal, then verbal authorization may be given by the City Arborist for the tree to be removed; a tree information permit is required to be submitted within 72 hours of the removal. 
                  5.  Trees grown specifically for sale, such as Christmas trees and nursery stock. 
                  9.1.5. - Tree Canopy Cover Requirements 
                  A.  A minimum amount of 45% tree canopy cover shall be required on public and private commercial properties within parking lots and within and extending over impervious surfaces and as a condition of protected tree removal or disturbance as further defined in this Section. 
                  B.  Tree canopy cover provided by existing protected trees on July 7, 2014 shall be conserved on a property to the greatest extent possible. On residential property no less than 25% of the existing protected tree canopy cover must be conserved, except as noted in Sec. 9.1.17.A. The establishment of additional tree canopy cover shall not be required unless as a condition of protected tree removal or tree disturbance as further defined in this Section. 
                  C.  Tree canopy cover conserved or planted to meet the requirements of this Section shall be conserved on the site in perpetuity. Required tree canopy cover lost over time shall be replaced during the first planting season after the loss occurs. 
                  9.1.6. - Parking Lots 
                  A.  Parking lots shall maintain 45% tree canopy cover and a minimum of 10% of the interior of the parking lot in landscaped area. 
                  B.  A minimum of 1 large or medium canopy tree shall be required for every 8 parking spaces. All landscape islands shall include at least 1 canopy tree. Only those species approved for parking lots as listed in the tree species list shall be planted within parking lots, unless other species are approved by the City Arborist on a case-by-case basis. 
                  C.  The tree canopy cover of existing boundary trees and other protected trees that projects over the parking lot may be counted for meeting tree canopy cover requirements. Additionally, trees planted outside but within 3 to 10 feet of the perimeter of a parking lot shall receive 50% of the standard tree canopy cover credit as shown in the tree species list for the purpose of meeting the 45% requirement. 

                  9.1.7. - Tree Canopy Cover Credit 
                  A.  All existing healthy trees greater than 4 inches DBH, with the exception of invasive and non-native, flowering ornamental species, shall be eligible for tree canopy cover credit. Invasive species and nonnative, flowering ornamental species are identified in the tree species list. 
                  B.  The amount of tree canopy cover on a site shall be measured as the percent of the lot area that is covered by tree canopy, including canopy that projects over buildings and impervious surfaces. The canopy projected over and onto the applicant's property by a tree growing on a neighboring property or on the boundary between properties or on public property may be included in the measurement of total tree canopy cover existing on a site. 
                  C.  The amount of tree canopy cover credited to individual or group of existing trees shall be the actual projection of the combined crowns onto the ground measured in square feet as described in the administrative standards. The preservation of specimen trees within the buildable area of a lot shall receive double canopy credit in the calculation of existing tree canopy. 
                  D.  New trees shall receive credit at the time of planting based on the tree canopy cover potential for the species at maturity as listed in the table below and the tree species list. 

                   
                  9.1.8. - Utility Company Requirements 
                  A.  All utility companies shall be required to submit an annual work plan to the City Arborist by December 1 each year for the following calendar year showing the proposed location, extent and type of work to be performed, type of tree disturbance that will occur and tree protection measures to be installed to minimize tree impact. The annual work plan shall include a list of subcontractors with names, address and City business license numbers. No work within the tree protection zone shall be performed until the annual work plan has been received by the City Arborist. 
                  B.  When changes are required to the annual work plan, notice in writing, for the City Arborist's approval, shall be submitted to the City Arborist prior to the changes taking place. These changes may include, but are not limited to, utility infrastructure installation, repair, and tree removal or disturbance not described in the annual work plan. 
                  C.  All work to be performed on or around protected trees shall be done in accordance with current ANSI A300 Standards for Tree Care Operations, ANSI Z133 Safety Standards, industry best management practices and the administrative standards that accompany this Section. 
                  D.  All tree pruning shall be supervised by a Certified Arborist. Pruning cuts shall be made in accordance with ANSI standards.

                  C.  During land disturbance and land development, active protection shall be required for protected trees and shall be in accordance with current ANSI A300 Standards for Tree Care Operations, ANSI Z133 Safety Standards, industry best management practices and administrative standards that accompany this Section. 
                  D.  Active tree protection measures, at a minimum, shall consist of the erection of tree protection fencing around the outer limits of the critical root zone, posting of tree protection area signs in both English and Spanish, and avoidance of any land disturbance or land development activities within the tree protection zone. 
                  E.  The City Arborist may require the expansion of the critical root zone up to 20% or approve encroachment of up to 20% by land disturbance activities. In no case shall land disturbance activities be approved within 10 feet of the trunk of a protected tree. 
                  F.  All tree protection measures shall be installed prior to land disturbance and shall be maintained until after final inspection. The City Arborist shall be contacted for an on-site conference after tree protection measures are installed and prior to land disturbance. 
                  G.  When the City Arborist determines that significant damage has occurred to any protected tree due to either permitted or non-permitted land disturbance activities, the City Arborist may require that the tree be treated according to professional standards to mitigate the damage. 
                  H.  If the City Arborist determines that the tree is irreparably damaged due to permitted land disturbance activities, the City Arborist may require that the tree be removed and the tree canopy cover replaced to maintain no net loss, or that the entire site be brought into compliance with the 45% canopy goal, depending on the scale of the project and existing canopy coverage. If the City Arborist determines that the tree is irreparably damaged due to non-permitted land disturbance activities, the City Arborist may require that the tree be removed and 2 times the tree canopy cover of the removed tree be replaced. 
                  9.1.10. - Tree Conservation Plan 
                  A.  A tree conservation plan shall be submitted as part of an application for a tree disturbance permit. The plan shall be prepared and certified by a registered forester, registered landscape architect, or certified arborist. No tree disturbance permit shall be issued without an approved tree conservation plan. 
                  B.  The plan shall include all information appropriate to the situation and as described in the administrative standards. 
                  C.  Applicants for a tree disturbance or site development permit may request a pre-submittal conference with the City Arborist to discuss tree ordinance and tree conservation plan requirements. 
                  D.  Upon submittal, the tree conservation plan shall be reviewed by the City Arborist and either approved or returned with comments explaining the changes necessary for compliance with this Section. Corrections to be made or reasons for denial shall be noted on the plan, or otherwise stated in writing to the applicant. 
                  E.  Full compliance with an approved tree conservation plan and tree protection measures shall be required and maintained during all phases of construction and prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
                  9.1.11. - Tree Canopy Replacement Requirements 
                  A.  For commercial sites that have 45% or greater tree canopy cover after the permitted removal of a protected tree, tree canopy replacement shall not be required. 
                  B.  The removal of a protected tree without a valid tree removal permit shall require tree canopy cover replacement on site with trees of comparable or greater mature canopy size and species quality in the amount of 2 times the tree canopy cover removed, regardless of the amount of tree canopy cover existing on the site after the removal. 
                  C.  For commercial sites that have less than 45% tree canopy cover after the permitted removal of a protected tree, the amount of tree canopy cover removed from the site shall be replaced on the site by trees of comparable or greater mature canopy size and species quality to maintain no net loss of tree canopy cover. For commercial sites, payments in lieu of required replacement planting shall not be approved. 
                  D.  For residential sites, removal of a protected tree, that requires a tree removal permit, shall require replanting to maintain no net loss. For residential sites, payments in lieu of required replacement shall be allowed for up to 50% of the required canopy replacement amount. 
                  E.  A tree planting design shall be submitted along with the tree removal permit application as described in the administrative standards. 
                  F.  On residential properties, any projects requiring a land disturbance or land development permit will require no net loss of tree canopy. A tree conservation plan shall be required for such projects. If required replacement trees cannot be accommodated on the site, as determined by the City Arborist, then a payment in lieu of planting for up to 50% of the tree canopy cover requirement may be made to the tree bank. For residential properties with greater than 60% tree canopy cover, a payment in lieu of planting for up to 100% of the tree canopy cover requirement may be made to the tree bank. 
                  G.  On commercial properties with less than 45% tree canopy cover and a land disturbance or land development project proposes a 15% or more increase in impervious cover or gross floor area, then the planting of additional tree canopy cover to achieve 45% tree canopy cover across the site shall be required. A tree conservation plan shall be required for such projects. If required replacement trees cannot be accommodated on the site as determined by the City Arborist, a payment in lieu of planting for up to 75% of the tree canopy cover requirement may be made to the tree bank. 
                  H.  All trees planted to meet tree canopy replacement requirements shall meet ANSI Z60.1 Standards for Nursery Stock and all planting shall be done in accordance with current ANSI A300 Standards for Tree Care Operations, ANSI Z133 Safety Standards and industry best management practices, as well as the administrative standards that accompany this Section. 
                  9.1.12. - Tree Maintenance Requirements

                  B.  Planted trees shall be maintained throughout the establishment period. Maintenance shall include, at a minimum, watering, mulching, training pruning, and if necessary, pest management. 
                  9.1.13. - Decatur Tree Bank 
                  A.  There is hereby established a Decatur Tree Bank that shall receive payments made by property owners in lieu of planting additional tree canopy cover as approved by the City Arborist, in addition to forfeited bonds and forfeited escrow funds. Funds in the tree bank shall be administered by the City Manager. 
                  B.  Where it is determined by the City Arborist that it is impractical or impossible to fully meet the tree canopy cover requirements for a site, the portion of the canopy that cannot be accommodated on the site may be satisfied by a payment into the tree bank that shall be made prior to the issuance of a tree removal or tree disturbance permit. The amount of the payment shall be calculated using the standard tree canopy value listed in the City's fee schedule. 
                  C.  The tree bank funds shall be available for use by the City for the establishment, maintenance, improvement and expansion of tree canopy cover on public or private property. Funds shall not be used on private property to meet the requirements of a development project. Funds may be used on private property to expand and improve the City's tree canopy. The expenditure of tree bank funds shall be permitted for various activities related to tree conservation including, but not limited to: 
                  1.  Purchase of trees; 
                  2.  Planting of trees;

                  A.  Tree removal and tree disturbance permit holders that are also required to have an approved tree conservation plan shall be required to furnish a 3-year tree planting bond or other financial security for trees planted to meet the requirements of the tree ordinance when determined by the City Arborist. The amount of the bond shall be equal to 125% of tree planting expenses, including materials and labor. 
                  B.  The City Arborist shall inspect planted trees and assess their health at the end of the establishment period and shall provide a written report to the permit holder indicating what actions, if any, are required before the bond will be released. If trees are found to be dead, dying or not healthy at the time of the inspection then replacement tree planting shall be required and the bond for replacement trees shall be retained for an additional 3 years. 
                  C.  In the case of boundary trees, an escrow account shall be established prior to final inspection to ensure the health and survival of conserved trees. 
                  D.  For boundary trees, an escrow account shall be established in the amount totaling the estimated cost of removal plus the cost to replace the boundary tree's canopy cover calculated as described for the tree planting bond plus the standard tree canopy value. 
                  E.  In establishing the cost to replace the boundary tree's canopy cover, replacement trees shall be of comparable or greater mature canopy size and species quality to the boundary tree, shall be ecologically compatible with the intended growing site, and shall fully replace the canopy of the boundary tree. 
                  F.  Boundary tree health and potential for survival shall be determined by the City Arborist after a maximum of 3 years after project completion, at which time the arborist shall either authorize the return of escrow funds to the permit holder or to the tree owner for the removal and replacement of the boundary tree should the boundary tree die, be destroyed or be determined to be in irreversible decline as a result of the permit holder's disturbance activities. The City Arborist may also require that the escrow account remain in place for up to an additional 2 years if signs of tree decline are evident but treatment options by the permit holder could be taken to improve tree health and longevity. 
                  G.  Neither the tree owner nor the permit holder shall be entitled to receive interest on any escrow funds required by this provision. Any funds not collected by either the boundary tree owner or the permit holder within a period of 5 years shall be deposited in the tree bank. 
                  9.1.15. - Standard Tree Canopy Value 
                  A.  A standard value for each square foot of tree canopy shall be established by the City for the purpose of calculating payments to the tree bank. The standard tree canopy value for a protected tree shall be determined on a square foot basis for the actual tree canopy or tree canopy cover credit for the species, whichever is greater. 
                  B.  The standard tree canopy value shall be based on a general but reasonable estimate of the average cost for a tree that would provide comparable canopy and including shipping, labor, installation, and 3 years of maintenance. 
                  C.  The City Arborist shall make a recommendation to the City Manager each year on the amount of the standard tree canopy value. The current standard tree canopy value shall be listed in the City's fee schedule. 
                  9.1.16. - Tree Planting Easements 
                  The City is hereby authorized to enter into agreements with the owners of private property located within the City for the purpose of acquiring easements to plant trees on such property, in consideration for which said property owner shall acquire ownership of such trees as the City may plant. Provided, however, that any such agreement shall limit the duration of the easement to a time period of 3 years and shall limit the property interest acquired by the City to that distance sufficient to allow the planting of trees. Provided, further, that under such agreement the private property owner shall agree to maintain the trees planted thereon and shall also agree to hold the City harmless for any liability attributable to the planting or presence of the trees on the private property.

This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in Sec. 9.2.4.B.1. above. 
                  3.  Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time this Section takes effect or approved under the terms of this Section. 
                  4.  Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this Section takes effect or approved under the terms of this article, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. 
                  5.  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this Section, the person performing it shall report such work to the City Manager on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit, submit the necessary documentation to obtain a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the City Manager to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area. 
                  6.  Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for 3 years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer. 
                  C.  Application   
                  After March 15, 2004, the stream buffer requirements stipulated herein shall apply to new subdivisions and site plans or any other construction or land disturbance in the vicinity of a stream, whether or not the stream is located within the parcel where the activity is proposed. 
                  D.  Development within a Buffer   
                  Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to Sec. 9.2.5.B. 
                  9.2.5. - Land Development Requirements 
                  A.  Buffer and Setback Requirements   
                  All land development activity subject to this Section shall meet the following requirements: 
                  1.  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. 
                  2.  An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 

                  3.  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
                  B.  Variance Procedures   
                  Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  1.  Where a parcel was platted prior to March 15, 2004, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this Section, and the City Manager finds and determines that the requirements of this Section prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
                  2.  Except as provided above, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall grant no variance from any provision of this Section without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the Zoning Board of Appeals. The City shall give public notice of each such public hearing in accordance with the procedures for variances in Sec. 11.2.9. The City Manager shall be present at any such variance hearings and the Board shall consider the testimony of the City Manager when granting any variance or relief from the requirements of this Section. 
                  3.  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing as of March 15, 2004 prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
                  b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the Section would create an extreme hardship. 
                  4.  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this Section, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  5.  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information in addition to the requirements of Article 11.: 
                  a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;

                  Sec. 9.3. - Stormwater Management 

                  9.3.1. - Description 
                  This Section addresses post-development stormwater management requirements for new development and redevelopment in the City. The Section defines requirements for a post-development stormwater management plan, which is required in order to undertake land development activities. The plan shall contain the details of how the development will address post-development stormwater runoff quality and quantity impacts resulting from the permanent alteration of the character and hydrology of the land surface as well as the nonpoint source pollution from land use activities. The Section also outlines the water quantity and quality performance design criteria for managing this runoff and specifies local requirements for the use of structural stormwater controls and nonstructural practices, in order to protect public health and safety; for the protection of public and private property and infrastructure, and for the protection of the environment. Ongoing long-term inspection and maintenance provisions are also required by this Section. The majority of technical criteria and standards required by this Section are adopted by reference through the use of the Georgia Stormwater Management Design Manual, as may be amended by local requirements contained in the City's stormwater management policy guidelines. 
                  9.3.2. - Introduction 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  A.  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  B.  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  C.  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  D.  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
                  E.  Therefore, the City has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  9.3.3. - General Provisions 
                  A.  Purpose and Intent   
                  The purpose of this Section is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This Section seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  1.  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  2.  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  3.  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  4.  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  5.  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the County's greenspace protection plan; 
                  6.  Encourage preservation of existing tree canopy by reducing the applicable post-development stormwater management performance criteria, as specified in Sec. 9.3.5. 
                  7.  Encourage the use of green infrastructure and low impact development practices as defined in the Coastal Supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management by reducing the applicable post-development stormwater management performance criteria, as specified in Sec. 9.3.5. 
                  8.  Require new developments and redeveloped properties that generate concentrated stormwater flows to connect to nearby storm sewer systems via underground conveyance; 
                  9.  Require new developments and redeveloped properties that generate concentrated stormwater flows to discharge above-ground flows into a stabilized, engineered channel from the point of release to the point of connection to the public stormwater system if connection to such storm sewer system via underground conveyance is not feasible; 
                  10.  Manage runoff impacts to adjacent properties by requiring post development runoff to be directed away from existing adjacent structures and released in a manner similar to the existing condition and by maintaining a drainage path for any existing off-site runoff that drains through the site; and 
                  11.  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities, and nonstructural stormwater management practices, green infrastructure practices, low impact development practices, and maintaining existing trees/canopies to be preserved to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  12.  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and longterm follow up. 
                  B.  Additional Requirements   
                  The list above is a general set of objectives to reduce the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality from land development activities. The City may establish additional requirements in the stormwater management policy guidelines, which set more specific objectives based upon a watershed management plan, a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requirement, impervious surface targets, the findings of a watershed assessment or study, or in order to address a local flooding or water quality problem or to assist in compliance with a pollutant total maximum daily load (TMDL) goal or restriction. 
                  C.  Applicability   
                  This Section shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, land disturbance applications, and grading applications. The following applicability table lists categories of sites and developments and defines applicable stormwater management criteria based upon defined parameters of improvements or land disturbing activities associated with the project. The standards of this Section (including, but not limited to, the performance criteria of Sec. 9.3.5.) apply to all new development or redevelopment unless otherwise indicated in the following table. 

                   
                  Applicability Table Notes: 
                  1.  When conducting stormwater management performance criteria calculations, the pre-developed condition of an existing impervious area that is removed shall revert to the coefficient/curve number for such area in its natural undeveloped state. (Refer to Pre-development definition within Article 12. and the City's Stormwater Management Policy Guidelines.) 
                  2.  When performing the overbank and extreme flood protection stormwater management criteria, attenuate the stormwater runoff to a level of 90 percent of that which would be generated from the site in its natural undeveloped state for all storms from the 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year storm. Refer to Sec. 9.3.5.C. and Sec. 9.3.5.D. for overbank and extreme flood protection performance criteria; Sec. 9.3.4.C.3.d. for redevelopment site limits; and the City's Stormwater Management Policy Guidelines. 
                  3.  In subdivisions and/or similar phased development projects, multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different schedules. In order to establish the applicable parameter that defines the development, the creation, addition, and/or replacement of impervious areas shall be totaled for all of the multiple separate land activities that will be associated with the site, regardless of ownership. 
                  4.  A 0.55 cfs increase is equivalent to approximately 4,058 square feet of impervious surface. 
                  5.  If the site does not have an existing stormwater detention facility, the required attenuation of the post-development stormwater runoff to meet the stream channel protection, overbank flood protection and extreme flood protection criteria may be deferred no more than once in a 5-year period. Any such deferral expires at the time of any subsequent development or redevelopment of the property. 
                  D.  Compatibility with Other Regulations   
                  This Section is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  E.  Stormwater Design Manual   
                  The City Manager will utilize the policy, criteria and information including technical specifications and standards in the latest edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, Coastal Supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, and any relevant local addenda as may be established in the City's stormwater management policy guidelines, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article. The Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and the City's stormwater management policy guidelines may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring and local maintenance experience. All references to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM) and Coastal Supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual shall mean the latest edition. 
                  9.3.4. - Permit Procedures and Requirements 
                  A.  Permit Application Requirements   
                  1.  No owner or developer shall perform any land development activities without first meeting the requirements of this Section and obtaining a stormwater management permit prior to commencing the proposed activity. 
                  2.  Unless specifically exempted by this Section, any owner or developer proposing a land development activity shall submit to the City Manager a permit application on a form provided by the City Manager for that purpose.

                  A.  Water Quality   
                  All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  1.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  2.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  3.  Appropriate green infrastructure practices and low impact development practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Coastal Supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  4.  Preservation of existing tree canopies as defined in the City's Stormwater Management Policy Guidelines; and 
                  5.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the City Manager are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  B.  Stream Channel Protection   
                  Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  1.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the 75-foot stream buffer required by Sec. 9.2. Stream Buffer Protection. 
                  2.  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the 1-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City Manager for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a man-made channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream stream bank or channel integrity, and provided that in any case where the requirements for stream channel protection are not met on site, the applicant shall pay into a stormwater mitigation bank established by the City the cost of providing the required level of stream channel protection, including easements and/or property acquisition costs and cost of design and construction of the appropriate treatment protection feature or features. 
                  3.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  C.  Overbank Flooding Protection   
                  Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to 90% of the pre-development rate for the 2-year through 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City Manager for sites where the post-development downstream analysis submitted by the applicant shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions, and provided that in any case where the requirements for overbank flood protection are not met on site, the applicant shall pay into a stormwater mitigation bank established by the City the cost of providing the required level of overbank flood protection, including easements and/or property acquisition costs and cost of design and construction of the appropriate treatment protection feature or features. 
                  D.  Extreme Flooding Protection   
                  Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) and safely conveying the post-development peak discharge rate to 90% of the pre-development rate for the 50-year and 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City Manager for sites where the post-development downstream analysis submitted by the applicant shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions, and provided that in any case where the requirement for extreme flood protection are not met on site, the applicant shall pay into a stormwater mitigation bank established by the City the cost of providing the required level of extreme flood protection, including easements and/or property acquisition costs and cost of design and construction of the appropriate treatment protection feature or features. 
                  E.  Structural Stormwater Controls   
                  All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual or the City's stormwater management policy guidelines, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the City Manager before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City Manager may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  F.  Stormwater Credits for Nonstructural Measures   
                  The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required above. The applicant may, if approved by the City Manager, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  G.  Green Infrastructure and Low Impact Development Practices   
                  The use of one or more green infrastructure and low impact development practices by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the criteria for water quality volume, stream channel protection, overbank flood protection, and extreme flood protection above. The minimum criteria and the potential reduction in the post development stormwater management criteria as defined in the Coastal Supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. The applicant may, if approved by the City Manager, take credit for the use of these green infrastructure and low impact development practices. See the City Stormwater Policy Guidelines for additional information as to how to implement these credits. 
                  H.  Preservation of Existing Tree Canopies   
                  Taking measure to preserve existing tree canopies during land development activities by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the criteria for water quality volume, stream channel protection, over-bank flood protection, and extreme flood protection above. The minimum criteria and potential reductions to the post-development stormwater management criteria is defined in the City's Stormwater Policy Guidelines. The applicant may, if approved by the City Manager, take credit for the preservation of existing tree canopies.

                  9.4.4. - Minimum Requirements 
                  A.  General Provisions   
                  Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the state (NPDES) general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this Section shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Sec. 9.4.4.B. and Sec. 9.4.4.C. below. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this Section and the state (NPDES) general permit. 
                  B.  Minimum Requirements/BMPs   
                  1.  Best management practices as set forth in Sec. 9.4.4.B. and Sec. 9.4.4.C. below shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with Sec. 9.4.4.B.2. below any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  2.  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the City or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the City or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  4.  The UDO Administrator may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board of Natural Resources, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  C.  Rules, Regulations, Ordinances, and Resolutions Adopted   
                  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  1.  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  2.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  11.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  13.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  14.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Sec. 9.4.4.B.2.; 
                  15.  Except as provided in Sec. 9.4.4.C.16. below, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. There is also established a 75-foot buffer required by Sec. 9.2. Unless a variance is granted by the director, the buffer that offers the greatest protection shall apply. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  i.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  ii.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  16.  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. There is also established a 75-foot buffer required by Sec. 9.2. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  i.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  ii.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  D.  Stream Buffer Requirements   
                  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent the City from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Sec. 9.4.4.B. and Sec. 9.4.4.C. Stream buffers shall be as specified in Sec. 9.2. 
                  E.  Injury to Property   
                  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this Section or the terms of the permit. 
                  9.4.5. - Application/Permit Process 
                  A.  General   
                  The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinances, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, stream buffer protection ordinance, this Section, and other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. The City shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. 
                  B.  Application Requirements   
                  1.  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City without first obtaining a permit from the City to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  2.  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in Sec. 9.4.5.C. below. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Sec. 9.4.4.B.. and Sec. 9.4.4.C. will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  3.  A fee, in accordance with the City's current fee schedule shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  4.  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  5.  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the City shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the City. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by Sec. 9.4.4.C.15. and Sec. 9.4.4.C.16. have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required by Sec. 9.4.5.B.7. below, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the City and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the City to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The City, if so authorized to conduct plan review, shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the City to act within 35 days of receipt shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  6.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this Section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the City may deny the permit application. 
                  7.  The City may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this Section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the City may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the City with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  C.  Plan Requirements   
                  1.  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in Sec. 9.4.4.B. and Sec. 9.4.4.C., or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this Section. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  2.  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  D.  Permits   
                  1.  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the City of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  2.  No permit shall be issued by the City unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the City has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this Section, any variances required by Sec. 9.4.4.C.15. and Sec. 9.4.4.C.16. are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per Sec. 9.4.5.B.7. are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  3.  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  4.  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the City, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this Section. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  5.  The City may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application. 
                  9.4.6. - Inspection and Enforcement 
                  A.  The City will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the City shall regulate both primary and secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this Section, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this Section. 
                  B.  The City shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this Section, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  C.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the City, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his or her official duties. 
                  D.  The District or the Commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  E.  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division may revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
                  9.4.7. - Penalties and Incentives 
                  A.  Failure to Obtain a Permit   
                  If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this Section without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City. 
                  B.  Stop Work Orders   
                  1.  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this Section, the director or the City shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the City shall issue a stop work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the City shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  2.  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the City shall issue an immediate stop work order; and

                  Sec. 9.5. - Floodplain Management/Flood Damage Prevention 

                  9.5.1. - Description 
                  A.  Floodplain management involves the designation of floodprone areas and the managing of their uses. It is also aimed at minimizing modifications to streams, reducing flood hazards, and protecting the beneficial uses of the floodplain such as water quality protection. As such, floodplain management can be seen as a subset of the larger consideration of surface water and stormwater management. 
                  B.  Floodplain regulations and development restrictions can greatly reduce future flooding impacts, preserve greenspace and habitat, and protect their function in safely conveying floodwaters and protecting water quality. This Section aims to help communities integrate floodplain management with stormwater management during the land development process. 
                  9.5.2. - Introduction 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  A.  The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  B.  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
                  C.  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can (1) Protect human life and health; (2) Minimize damage to private property; (3) Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  D.  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Commission establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
                  9.5.3. - General Provision 
                  A.  Purpose and Intent   
                  The purpose of this Section is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, stream bank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  1.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  2.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  3.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  4.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  5.  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and 
                  6.  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
                  B.  Applicability   
                  This Section shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the City. 
                  C.  Designation of Ordinance Administrator   
                  The UDO Administrator is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this Section. 
                  D.  Basis for Establishing Areas of Special Flood Hazard, Areas of Future-Conditions Flood Hazard and Associated Floodplain Characteristics - Flood Area Maps and Studies   
                  For the purposes of defining and determining "Areas of Special Flood Hazard," "Areas of Future-conditions Flood Hazard," "Areas of Shallow Flooding," "Base Flood Elevations," "Floodplains," "Floodways," "Future-conditions Flood Elevations," "Future-conditions Floodplains," potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRM maps, and other terms used in this ordinance, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto:

                  D.  Engineering Study Requirements for Floodplain Encroachments   
                  An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the UDO Administrator prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the UDO Administrator prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  1.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  2.  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the UDO Administrator. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
                  3.  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
                  4.  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
                  E.  Floodway Encroachments   
                  1.  Located within Areas of Special Flood Hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  2.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in Section 9.5.5.E.2. below. 
                  3.  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  4.  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the UDO Administrator until an affirmative Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the UDO Administrator. 
                  F.  Maintenance Requirements   
                  The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. The UDO Administrator may direct the property owner (at no cost to the City) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the flood-plain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the UDO Administrator.

                  9.5.7. - Variance Procedures 
                  The following variance procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this Section. 
                  A.  Requests for variances from the requirements of this Section shall be submitted in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 11.2.9. The UDO Administrator shall be present at all such Zoning Board of Appeals variance proceedings and the Board shall consider the UDO Administrator's testimony when deciding any variance. 
                  B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  C.  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this Section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  D.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  E.  In reviewing such requests, the UDO Administrator and Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this Section. 
                  F.  Criteria for variances. 
                  1.  In addition to the criteria for variances in Sec. 11.2.9., a variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  2.  The provisions of this ordinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
                  3.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided. 
                  4.  The UDO Administrator shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  G.  In addition to the requirements for variances in Sec. 11.2.9., any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the UDO Administrator and Zoning Board of Appeals shall deem necessary for the consideration of the request. 
                  H.  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this Section, the UDO Administrator and the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this Section. 
                  I.  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact." 
                  9.5.8. - Violations, Enforcement and Penalties and Appeals 
                  Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this Section or the requirements of an approved stormwater management plan or permit, may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this Section.

                  Sec. 9.6. - Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection 

                  9.6.1. - Description 
                  An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to the municipal separate storm sewer system (stormwater drainage system) that is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff (except for discharges allowed under an NPDES permit or non-polluting flows). These non-stormwater discharges occur due to illegal dumping or illegal connections to the stormwater drainage system. This Section provides the City with the authority to deal with illicit discharges and establishes enforcement actions for those persons or entities found to be in noncompliance or that refuse to allow access to their facilities. 
                  9.6.2. - Introduction 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  A.  Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  B.  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments; 
                  C.  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters; 
                  D.  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  E.  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system; 
                  F.  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system; 
                  G.  Therefore, the City adopts this Section to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
                  9.6.3. - General Provisions 
                  A.  Purpose and Intent   
                  The purpose of this Section is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by Federal law. This Section establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this Section are to: 
                  1.  Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system by any person; 
                  2.  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system; 
                  3.  Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the municipal separate storm sewer system; and 
                  4.  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this Section. 
                  B.  Applicability   
                  The provisions of this Section shall apply throughout the corporate limits of the City, Georgia.

                  9.6.6. - Access and Inspection of Properties and Facilities 
                  The City Manager shall be permitted to enter and inspect properties and facilities at reasonable times as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this Section. 
                  A.  If a property or facility has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the owner or operator shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the City Manager. 
                  B.  The owner or operator shall allow the City Manager ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, photography, videotaping, examination and copying of any records that are required under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater. 
                  C.  The City Manager shall have the right to set up on any property or facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the City Engineer to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of flow discharges. 
                  D.  The City Manager may require the owner or operator to install monitoring equipment and perform monitoring as necessary, and make the monitoring data available to the City Manager. This sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the owner or operator at his/her own expense. All devices used to measure flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
                  E.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the property or facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the owner or operator at the written or oral request of the City Manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner or operator. 
                  F.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the City Manager access to a facility is a violation of this Section. 
                  G.  If the City Manager has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the City Manager is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this Section, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this Section or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, environment and welfare of the community, then the City Manager may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  9.6.7. - Notification of Accidental Discharges and Spills 
                  A.  Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility, activity or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility, activity or operation has information of any known or suspected release of pollutants or non-stormwater discharges from that facility or operation which are resulting or may result in illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the municipal separate storm sewer system, state waters, or waters of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release so as to minimize the effects of the discharge. 
                  B.  Said person shall notify the City Manager or other authorized enforcement agency in person, by phone, or by facsimile no later than 24 hours of the nature, quantity and time of occurrence of the discharge.

                  (Ord. No. O-15-01, § 4, 1-20-15) 
                  Sec. 9.7. - Stormwater Utility 

                  9.7.1. - Establishment of Utility 
                  A.  Findings   
                  The City Commissioners make the following findings of fact: 
                  1.  The professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the City Commissioners properly assess and define the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the City. 
                  2.  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the City, it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of a separate accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the City. 
                  3.  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the City. Intense urban development in the City has radically altered the natural hydrology of the area and the hydraulics of stormwater systems, with many natural elements having been replaced or augmented by man-made facilities. As a result, the specific service, system and facility demands in the City now exceed the service capability of many of the systems. An advanced level of service is needed in the City due to its urbanization. Therefore a stormwater utility service area subject to stormwater service charges should encompass the entirety of the City to enable the City to successfully manage, operate and improve stormwater systems at an advanced level. 
                  4.  It is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater service level continue to be funded from the City's general tax revenues, and therefore that the City Commissioners may allocate general fund support to stormwater management in the future in the form of a combination of service charge payments for City-owned properties and a supplemental allocation of general fund funding. 
                  5.  The stormwater needs in the City include but are not limited to protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Funding of stormwater services and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the City in protecting the public health, safety and welfare. 
                  6.  Provision of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the City and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the City concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses, and the service and benefits differ among the individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems. 
                  7.  The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater programs, systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is not practical to allocate the cost of the City's stormwater management programs, systems and facilities in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time, but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the long-term demands they impose on the City's stormwater programs, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits. 
                  8.  The City presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems and facilities owned and operated by the City, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the City to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater systems and facilities in the City. In order to do so, the City must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
                  9.  The City Commissioners find, conclude and determine that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and benefits throughout the City, and the most equitable means to fund an advanced level of stormwater services in the City through stormwater service charges and other mechanisms as described in the professional engineering and financial analyses prepared for the City. 
                  B.  Establishment of a Utility and an Enterprise Fund   
                  1.  There is hereby established a stormwater utility which shall be responsible for stormwater management programs throughout the City, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. The stormwater utility management unit shall be composed of such personnel, employees and agents of the City as the City Commissioners may from time to time determine and their compensation shall be fixed and determined by the City Manager as approved by the City Commissioners. 
                  2.  A stormwater enterprise fund shall be established in the City budget and accounting system for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees and licenses as may be established by the City Commissioners and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the stormwater utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater enterprise fund and all expenses of the utility shall be paid from the stormwater enterprise fund, except that other revenues receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management programs, facilities, operations and capital investments as deemed appropriate by the City Commissioners, upon recommendation by the City Manager. 
                  3.  The City Commissioners hereby confer upon the stormwater utility operational control over the existing stormwater management programs, systems and facilities performed, provided or owned and heretofore operated by the City and other related assets, including but not limited to properties other than roadways upon which such systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management. 
                  C.  Scope of Responsibility   
                  1.  The City owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvement of those stormwater systems and facilities which: 
                  a.  Are located within public streets, rights-of-way and easements; 
                  b.  Are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or 
                  c.  Are located on public lands to which the City has adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of systems and facilities. 
                  2.  Operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the City and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. 
                  3.  It is the express intent of this Section to protect the public health, safety and welfare of all properties and persons in general by regulation of the stormwater system and facilities, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the City. The City expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the City, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. 
                  4.  To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the City as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the City, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation, or rule of the City or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the City, its officers, employees or agents. 
                  D.  Enforcement Methods and Inspections   
                  1.  All property owners and developers of real property to be developed within the City shall provide, manage, maintain and operate on-site stormwater systems and facilities sufficient to collect, convey, detain, control and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all City development regulations and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the City in the municipal court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the City may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof charged to the owner in the same manner as a stormwater service charge. 
                  2.  In the event that the City shall file an action pursuant to Sec. 9.7.1.D.1. above, from the date of filing such action the City shall have lien rights in relation to any service charge assessed against the property in the same manner as a tax levied against the property, which rights may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Superior Court of DeKalb County, Georgia. In addition, the City shall have the right to pursue collection of the service charge through other legal action or judgment. 
                  3.  The City shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this Section, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private property and public property owned by other than the City, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with any order or judgment entered pursuant to this Section. 
                  E.  General Funding Policy   
                  1.  It shall be the policy of the City that funding for the stormwater utility program, systems and facilities shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater program, systems and facilities by individual properties or persons and/or the level of service rendered by or resulting from the provision of stormwater programs, systems and facilities. Stormwater service charge rates shall be structured so as to be fair and reasonable, and the resultant service charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rentals, rates, charges, fees or licenses. Service charge rates shall be structured to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management within the City, including but not limited to general tax revenues allocated to stormwater management, plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges and special assessments. 
                  2.  The cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities may include operating, capital investment and reserve expenses, and may consider stormwater quality as well as stormwater quantity management problems, needs and requirements. 
                  3.  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service charges and/or other methods of funding stormwater management shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the City's standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater systems or facilities or to private stormwater facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater systems or facilities. 
                  4.  Stormwater utility service charge rates, fees and other similar charges shall be established by the City Commissioners. 
                  Sec. 9.8. - Stormwater Management Rates 

                  9.8.1. - Findings 
                  The City Commissioners of the City make the following findings of fact: 
                  A.  The professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and considered by the City Commissioners properly assess, define and project the cost of stormwater management systems and facilities of the City. 
                  B.  Given the projected cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the City, it is appropriate to adopt a stormwater service fee rate methodology and to charge service fees to properties and persons within the City in a manner that recovers the cost of programs, systems and facilities and other costs associated therewith, including but not limited to allocations of the cost of services provided to the stormwater management utility by other funds of the City and other government entities and agencies, interest on bonds, operational and emergency reserves, allowances for delinquencies and bad debt, and such other costs as may be deemed reasonable and appropriate by the City Commissioners of the City to ensure the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater programs, systems and facilities in the City. 
                  C.  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the City and the stormwater service fee rate methodology and service fees should be applicable throughout the City to enable the City to successfully manage, operate and improve stormwater programs, systems and facilities at an advanced level. 
                  D.  It is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater program, systems and facilities continue to be funded from the City's general tax revenues, and therefore that the City Commissioners may allocate general fund support to stormwater management in the future in the form of a combination of service fee payments for City-owned properties and a supplemental allocation of the general fund. 
                  E.  The stormwater needs in the City include but are not limited to protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Funding of stormwater programs, systems and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the City in protecting the public health, safety and welfare. 
                  F.  Provision of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities renders and/or results in both services and benefits to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the City and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the City concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses, and the services and benefits differ among the individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems and facilities. 
                  G.  The services and benefits rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is not practical to allocate the cost of the City's stormwater management programs, systems and facilities in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time, but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the longterm demands they impose on the City's stormwater programs, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits. 
                  H.  The City presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems and facilities owned and operated by the City, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the City to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater systems and facilities in the City. In order to do so, the City must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
                  9.8.2. - Stormwater Service Fee Rates 
                  Stormwater service fee rates may be determined and modified from time to time by the City Commissioners of the City so that the total revenue generated by said fees and any other sources of revenues or other resources allocated to stormwater management by the City Commissioners shall be sufficient to meet the cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities, including but not limited to the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, operating expense, capital outlays, non-operating expense, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the City Commissioners of the City. Stormwater service fee revenues in any given year may exceed or be less than the cost of service in that year, provided, however, that the stormwater service fee rate shall be based on meeting the long-term projected cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities. All unencumbered stormwater management funds derived from service fees and other sources of revenue not expended at the end of a fiscal year shall remain in the stormwater management utility enterprise fund account and balances shall be forwarded to the next fiscal year. 
                  A.  Single-family dwelling units. Single-family dwelling units, as defined by this Section, shall be billed for one equivalent residential unit, as defined in this Section. 
                  B.  Other developed lands. All developed lands not classified as single-family dwelling units, as defined by this Section, shall be billed for one equivalent residential unit, as defined by this Section, for each 2,900 square feet of impervious surfaces or partial increment thereof located on the property. 
                  C.  The stormwater service charge rate per equivalent residential unit (as defined in this Section) in accordance with the City's current fee schedule shall be charged. 
                  9.8.3. - Exemptions and Credits 
                  Except as provided in this Section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater utility service fees or receive a credit or offset against such service fees. No exemption, credit, offset or other reduction in stormwater service fees shall be granted based on the age, tax, or economic status, race or religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities. A Stormwater Utility Service Fee Credit Technical Manual shall be prepared by the City Manager and approved by the City Commission specifying the design and performance standards of on-site stormwater systems, facilities and activities that qualify for application of a service fee credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. 
                  A.  Properties not defined in this Section as developed land shall be exempt from stormwater service fees. 
                  B.  Railroad tracks shall be exempt from stormwater service fees. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service fees. 
                  C.  Developed land than other single-family dwelling units, including but not limited to multiple-family dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial, retail and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks and other recreational properties, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, and water and wastewater treatment plants and all other types of developed land except single-family dwelling units may receive a credit against the stormwater service fee applicable to the property. The stormwater utility service fee credit for on-site stormwater control systems or facilities that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces on the subject property shall be proportional to the extent that the on-site stormwater control systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner meets or exceeds the City's development and performance standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Fee Credit Technical Manual and other requirements and conditions. The amount of the stormwater utility service fee credit shall not be related to the cost incurred by the property owner for performing, constructing, providing and/or maintaining such programs, systems, facilities, services and activities. 
                  D.  Groups of single-family dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association that owns, operates and maintains on-site stormwater control systems or facilities, or that provides services or activities that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces located on the subject properties may receive a credit against the stormwater service fee applicable to the properties represented by the homeowner's association. Such service fee credit shall be based on attaining and continuing compliance with the technical requirements and performance standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Fee Credit Technical Manual and other requirements and conditions. The stormwater utility service fee credit for on-site stormwater control systems or facilities, or for services or activities provided by groups of single-family dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association shall be proportional to the extent that the on-site stormwater control systems or facilities provided, operated and maintained by the homeowner's association meets or exceeds the City's development and performance standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Fee Credit Technical Manual and other requirements and conditions.

                  9.8.4. - Stormwater Service Fee Billing, Delinquencies, and Collections 
                  A.  A stormwater service fee bill may be sent though the United States mail or by alternative means, notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. The stormwater service fee bill may be billed and collected along with other fees and charges, including but not limited other utility bills, assessments or property taxes, as deemed most effective and efficient by the City Manager of the City. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fees and other charges and any associated fines or penalties, including but not limited to interest on delinquent service fees. If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent for developed land the City may backbill for a period of up to 1 year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency during that backbilled period. A late charge of 1% of the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility service fee bill shall be charged when a bill becomes delinquent.

The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  7.  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer, the City Commissioners of the City, and the City are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  8.  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the City Manager and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  9.  If the public officer's investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building or structure finds that it is in such condition as to make it imminently dangerous to the health, morals, safety, or general welfare of its occupants, the public officer shall order that such dwelling, building or structure be vacated. 
                  D.  Collection of Lien

The Clerk of Superior Court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of DeKalb County and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  2.  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this section, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this section shall transmit to the City Manager a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition or closure. It shall be the duty of the City Manager to collect the amount of the lien, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically Chapter 4 of Title 48 of O.C.G.A.; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78, which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure, shall not apply. The City Manager shall remit the amount collected to the City Commissioners of the City. 
                  3.  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this section may be initiated at any time following receipt by the City Manager of the final determination of costs in accordance with this section.

                  3.  General Requirements   
                  The following apply to all buildings subject to this paragraph a.: 
                  a.  All dwelling units must receive envelope and duct tightness verification in accordance with the current Georgia Residential Energy Code. Visual inspection may not be used in lieu of testing. The building thermal envelope for newly constructed buildings must test at less than 5 Air Changes per Hour when tested at 50 Pascals ( 5 ACH50) or, as an alternative, must demonstrate an Envelope Leakage Ratio of less than 0.33 CFM50/Square Foot of Building Envelope ( 0.33 ELR50) for dwelling units 1,500 square feet or less in floor area. Substantial improvement projects are exempt from this requirement and must comply with thresholds as outlined in the Georgia Residential Energy Code (7 ACH50 as of 2014). 
                  b.  No alterations will be mandated to systems that are not being modified as part of the planned construction process, unless otherwise required by state or local rules and regulations.

                  ASHRAE 62.2-2010 Equation 4.1a 
                  CFM = 0.01 × Floor Area + 7.5 × (bedrooms + 1) 

                   
                  d.  The ventilation system airflow must be verified via airflow testing to be capable of providing quantities of outside air (in cubic feet per minute, CFM) that satisfy ASHRAE 62.2-2010, but may operate by default at a lower ventilation rate. The method of verification must be a volumetric air flow measuring device or measurement of the velocity of the air in the duct and calculating the CFM. Ventilation controls must be labeled and easily accessible for occupants, and are encouraged to offer occupant variability such as a temporary override switch that resets itself. The occupant must not be able to reduce the outside air to below 10% of the required outside air. All kitchen and bath exhaust devices must satisfy ASHRAE 62.2-2010 CFM efficiency and sone requirements and must terminate to the exterior. 
                  e.  Outside air must be ducted from a manufactured outside air intake device that is protected from animals and large debris and is at least 10 feet from pollutant sources.

                  i.  The least expensive allowed project certification and verification fees exceed 10% of the construction costs (not including construction costs incurred to comply with the high performance building requirements); or 
                  ii.  The building is a designated historic building or a contributing building within a designated historic district and the Historic Preservation Commission has denied a certificate of appropriateness necessary for compliance with these requirements due to the negative impact such compliance would have on the historic qualities of the building. 
                  iii.  The building is a historic structure or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, and when compliance with these requirements would cause the building to cease to be a historic structure or make the structure ineligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. 
                  b.  All decisions granting or denying such infeasibility exemptions shall be made by the UDO Administrator in writing within 20 days of the filing of a request by the applicant that contains all information demonstrating compliance with the required criteria for exemption. The applicant shall be notified when a final decision is made and shall be provided a copy of the written decision. Appeals by any party aggrieved by the decision shall be made in accordance with Sec. 11.2.9.

                  In existing buildings or structures under the classification of Sec. 10.2.3.A., when substandard conditions are found, a temporary occupancy permit may be issued, such permit carrying a time limit for a time adjusted to meet the amount of time being necessary to make the proper corrections in order to bring the building up to standard. All certificates of occupancy shall be issued against the building and shall not require renewal because of change of ownership unless there is a change of use. The same set of fees for certificates of occupancy as applicable to proposed buildings covered under Sec. 10.2.3.C. shall apply. The fire marshal shall determine the time limit in complying with any of the provisions of this article.

A less restrictive provision contained in any subsequently adopted minimum fire standard may be applied to any existing building or structure. 
                  2.  Every proposed building and structure which comes under the classification of Sec. 10.2.3.A. shall comply with the adopted minimum fire safety standards under the state rules and regulations that were in effect on the date that the plans and specifications therefore were received by the fire marshal for review and approval in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 10.2.3.C. 
                  F.  Right of Entry to Inspect Premises   
                  The fire marshal shall have the authority at all times of day or night to enter in or upon and examine all buildings or premises where a fire is in progress or has occurred and other buildings or premises adjacent or near the same. Likewise, the fire marshal shall have the right to enter in and upon all buildings and premises subject to this article at all reasonable times for the purpose of examination or inspection. 
                  G.  Notice to Correct Conditions   
                  Whenever the fire marshal shall find any building or other structure which, for want of repair or by reason of age or dilapidated condition or from any other cause, is especially liable to fire hazard or which is so situated as to endanger other property or the safety of the public; or whenever such officer shall find, in or around any building, combustible or explosive matter, inflammables, or other conditions dangerous to the safety of such building, notice may be given to the owner or agent and occupant of any building coming under the provisions of this section to correct such unsafe condition as may be found. 
                  H.  Court Order to Correct Conditions   
                  If any owner, agent, or occupant fails to comply with the notice prescribed in the preceding section, within the time specified in the notice, the fire marshal, upon approval of the City Commission, may petition the court for a rule nisi to show cause why an order should not be issued by the court that the same be removed or remedied. Such court order shall forthwith be complied with by the owner or occupant of the premises or building within such time as may be fixed in the court order. Nothing contained in this section, however, shall be deemed to be a waiver of the City's right to cause citation to be issued to the owner or occupant of any building or structure for violation of any applicable ordinance of the City. 
                  I.  Failure to Comply with Court Order   
                  If any person fails to comply with the order of the court within the time fixed, then the City shall cause such building or premises to be forthwith repaired, torn down or demolished, the hazardous materials removed, and all dangerous conditions remedied, as the case may be, at the expense of the City. If the owner thereof, within 30 days after notice in writing of the amount of such expense, fails, neglects or refuses to repay the City the expense thereby incurred, the City shall issue a writ of fieri facias (fi. fa.) against the owner of the property for the expense actually incurred. 
                  J.  Final Authority for Ordering Enforcement   
                  Sec. 10.2.3.F. through Sec. 10.2.3.F. shall be construed so that the final authority for carrying out and enforcement of such sections shall be by order of the court and not by the fire marshal or City Commission. 
                  K.  Sovereign Immunity of City   
                  Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to constitute a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the City or any officer or employee thereof in carrying out the provisions of this article. No action shall be maintained against the City or any officer, elected officer, or employee thereof for damages sustained as a result of any fire or related hazard covered by this article by reason of any inspection or other action taken or not taken pursuant to this article. Nothing in this article shall be construed to relieve any property owner or lessee thereof from any legal duty, obligation or liability incidental to the ownership, maintenance and use of such property.

No fines shall be assessed to a business or residence for the first three false alarms, at the same alarm panel location responded to by the fire department during period of 12 consecutive calendar months. If the responsible person(s) for the property at which an alarm occurs fail to provide one or more current key holders or key holders refuse to respond when requested by the fire department, the responsible person(s) for the property are liable for any damages and costs, of incidents or emergencies that may occur within or to their property, and/or to any other impacted property.

                  C.  Resubmittal   
                  When action is unfavorable on an application for variance or where the applicant withdraws the application prior to final action by the Board, a substantially similar application may not be resubmitted for at least 1 year from the date of denial or withdrawal. This requirement may be waived for good cause by the Zoning Administrator. 
                  D.  Criteria for Approval   
                  The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the authority to authorize upon application in specific cases a variance from the terms of this UDO such as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this UDO will result in unnecessary hardship, but where the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. Such special conditions shall be limited to exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property existing at the time of the enactment of this UDO, or exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property as would result in peculiar, extraordinary and practical difficulties. No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that all of the following conditions exist: 
                  1.  That the special circumstances or conditions applying to the building or land in question are peculiar to such premises and do not apply generally to other land or buildings in the vicinity. 
                  2.  That the granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a property right and not merely to serve as a convenience to the applicant. 
                  3.  That the condition from which relief or a variance is sought did not result from action by the applicant. 
                  4.  That the authorizing of the variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or imperil the public safety, or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding areas, or in any other respect impair the health, safety, comfort, morals or general welfare of the inhabitants of the City. 
                  5.  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Decatur Land Use Plan. 
                  6.  That the granting of the variance will not allow a structure or use in a district restricted against such structure or use. 
                  E.  Notice and Hearing   
                  1.  The Board shall fix a date for the hearing of a variance application within the time specified by its rules but not to exceed 30 days from the date of a completed application is filed unless said time period is mutually extended by the applicant and the Zoning Administrator. The Board shall give public notice thereof, and decide the same in accordance with the procedures set forth herein and in its rules. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to post notices of the time and place of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation and by placard on or within 300 feet of the property as measured along the street right-of-way line. 
                  2.  At the hearing, any party may appear in person, or by agent or attorney. The applicant shall be allowed no less than 10 minutes for presentation of data, evidence and opinion concerning the application. Any remaining time may be reserved for rebuttal. Those in opposition to the application shall also be allowed no less than 10 minutes for presentation of data, evidence and opinion. The presentation times may not be reduced but may be extended, provided they are expanded equally for each side. 
                  F.  Conditions to Approval   
                  1.  In approving an application, the Zoning Board of Appeals may impose special conditions which it deems necessary in order to mitigate negative impacts upon surrounding properties which may be expected without the imposition of those conditions. Such conditions may consist of a variety of requirements, including, but not limited to: 
                  a.  Setbacks from any lot line if such setback is a proper part of the application under review; 
                  b.  Specified or prohibited locations for buildings, parking, loading or storage areas or other structures;

                  n.  Any other requirement deemed appropriate and necessary as a condition of approval. 
                  2.  Requirements imposed as a condition of approval shall be required of the property owner and all subsequent owners as a condition of the use of the property and interpreted and continuously enforced by the Zoning Administrator.

In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by a court of record on application with notice to the UDO Administrator or Zoning Administrator and on due cause shown. 
                  E.  Fee

The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure building required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure.

                  Criteria for Evaluation 
                  The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and: 
                  A.  That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or 
                  B.  That are associated with the lives of significant persons in or past; or 
                  C.  That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or 
                  D.  That have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in history or prehistory. 
                  Criteria Considerations 
                  Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years shall not be considered eligible for the National Register. However, such properties will qualify if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria or if they fall within the following categories: 
                  A.  A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance; or 
                  B.  A building or structure removed from its original location but which is primarily significant for architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic person or event; or 
                  C.  A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no appropriate site or building associated with his or her productive life; or 
                  D.  A cemetery that derives its primary importance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events; or 
                  E.  A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with the same association has survived; or 
                  F.  A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional significance; or 
                  G.  A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance.
