         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Rockdale County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1978 Code, as supplemented through May 13, 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1978 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Senior Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Mr. John Nix, County Attorney, and Ms. Jennifer Rutledge, County Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

                  Editor's note— Part I of this volume is a compilation of local laws involving the county adopted by the Georgia General Assembly or adopted under home rule by the county along with state constitutional amendments and general laws of local application (population acts) to the county only. No state laws of general application are reprinted here but references to those laws are occasionally included in appropriate places. 
                  The material included in this part has been arranged according to subject matter. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Any material in brackets has been added to clarify the meaning of the text. At the end of each section appears a reference to the basic act and amendatory acts, if any. The editor has added section numbers and catchlines to facilitate use of this compilation and indexing; however, formal citations should be to the original act, and not to this compilation. There is a Related Laws Comparative Table listing chronologically the laws in this part and their location in this part. 
                  A uniform system of citations to state statutes has been used.

                  (1977 Ga. Laws, page 2817, § 1) 
                  Sec. 2-32. - Definitions and general provisions. 
                  The following words and phrases shall, for purposes of this act, have the indicated meanings and limitations unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
                  (1)  Board shall mean the board of commissioners of Rockdale County. 
                  (2)  Capital improvements shall mean any real or personal property of any kind or any repair and maintenance thereof, other than a contract for services, where said property or repairs and maintenance has a useful life expectancy of over one (1) year and where said property is acquired by the county through the expenditure of county funds of over one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or the exchange of the equivalent in county property, service or labor. This shall include but not be limited to the acquisition of any land or interest therein and the acquisition of any building or road, unless otherwise provided by law, and any repairs or maintenance of any road or building. The acquisition of capital improvements shall be made only where funds therefor have been appropriated in the county budget and are also directly and specifically authorized by the board or a designee thereof. Additionally, said improvements shall only be made in the order of priority established by the board of commissioners. 
                  (3)  Commission shall mean the board of commissioners of Rockdale County. 
                  (4)  Chairperson shall mean the county chairperson or chairperson of the board of commissioners of Rockdale County.

                  (6)  Expenditure shall mean the disbursement of any funds from any account under the budgetary control of the board of commissioners. Other than expenditures from bank accounts which may be established for the various elected county officials, all expenditures from county funds shall be authorized by or bear the authorized signature of the chairperson and the director of finance or others in their absence as may be defined and provided for by the board of commissioners. Except for purchases of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) or less and payroll expenditures, no expenditure shall be authorized by the chairperson except with the prior specific approval of the board of commissioners where required by this act or with at least the informal advance approval of one (1) other member of the board of commissioners or by designees thereof. 
                  (7)  Purchase shall mean the expenditure of county funds for or contracting for any goods or services for which any expenditure of county funds may be made or where county property or services are exchanged for any goods or services; provided, however, that "purchase" shall not include regular payroll expenditures for county employees, nor shall it include expenditures or contracts for professional services as herein defined. Purchase orders shall not be accumulated or split so as to evade any purchasing limitations in this act, including but not limited to unnecessarily issuing several purchase orders for substantially the same or similar goods or services from the same vendor or similar vendors over a short period of time. 
                  (8)  Professional services shall mean services of a unique nature not normally subject to competition such as legal and medical services as well as telephone and other utilities. Acquisition by the county of such services shall be made only upon approval of the board of commissioners, which board may advertise, interview, seek bids or quotations for such services as will, in the board's discretion, aid in obtaining the best such service available. Insurance shall be considered a "professional service" hereunder. 
                  (9)  Payroll expenditure shall mean and include wages and salaries paid to county employees under any county personnel, civil or merit system or any personnel exempt by law or contract from direct control and supervision of the chairperson or board. Any expenditure of county funds made to any person performing services for the county under a separate and distinct personal contract with the county shall not be considered a "payroll expenditure." 
                  (10)  Resolution shall mean and include any resolution, ordinance or other official action of the board of commissioners approved at a public meeting of the board by a majority vote of a quorum of the members thereof.

                  In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority, and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary of the authority, and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and the secretary of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons; and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such person may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office.

                  Sec. 2-362. - Same—Conditions precedent to issuance. 
                  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified or required by this act [division]. In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project.

                  Sec. 2-363. - Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act [division] shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Rockdale County or the City of Conyers nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said political subdivisions; but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate said county or city to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment.

                  Sec. 2-364. - Trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for the protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of any project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of any project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys; and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor; and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers; and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.

Such funds so pledged from whatever source received, including funds received from one (1) or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund which shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of: 
                  (1)  The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due; 
                  (2)  The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; 
                  (3)  The necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest and other investment charges; and 
                  (4)  Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. 
                  The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture; but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, any surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds; and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued.

                  Sec. 2-369. - Validation. 
                  Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the "Revenue Bond Law," (O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.). The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated; and the state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the contract or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis for the security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds when validated and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority issuing the same and the state and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said authority.

No other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this act [division] shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.

                  (c)  The clerk of the magistrate court shall serve as clerk of the small claims division. 
                  (d)  (1)  Actions in the small claims division shall be commenced by the filing of a statement of claim, including the last known address of the defendant, in concise form and free from technicalities. The plaintiff or his agent shall verify the statement of claim by oath or affirmation in the form herein provided, or its equivalent, and shall affix his signature thereto. At the request of any individual, the judge or clerk may prepare the statement of claim and other papers required to be filed in an action. 
                  (2)  A copy of the verified statement of claim, together with a notice of hearing in the form hereinafter prescribed, shall be served on the defendant, and such service shall be sufficient to give the court jurisdiction in the premises. Service of said notice shall be made only within the county. Said service shall be made by any official or person authorized by law to serve process in the superior court, by a duly qualified bailiff of the small claims division, by registered or certified mail with receipt, or by any person not a party to, or otherwise interested in, the suit, who is specially appointed by the judge of said division for that purpose. 
                  (3)  When notice is to be served by registered or certified mail, the clerk or the judge shall enclose a copy of the statement of claim; the verification and the notice in an envelope address to the defendant at his last known address; prepay the postage from monies collected for that purpose, and mail the same forthwith, noting the date of mailing on the record. When a receipt therefor is returned, or if the sealed envelope in which said notice was mailed to the defendant by registered or certified mail is returned to the sender by United States postal authorities marked "refused," giving the date of refusal, and such notation of refusal is signed or initialed by a United States postal employee or United States mail carrier to whom refusal was made, then the clerk, or judge shall attach the same to the original statement and notice of claim, or otherwise file it as a part of the record in the case, and it shall be prima facie evidence of service upon the defendant. 
                  (4)  When served by a private individual, as provided above, such individual shall make proof of service by affidavit, showing the time and place of such service on the defendant. 
                  (5)  Upon the failure of the defendant to appear, the plaintiff shall be entitled to judgment by default, without further proof, when the claim of the plaintiff is for a liquidated amount. 
                  (6)  Said notice shall include the date, hour and location of the hearing, which date shall not be less than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30) days from the date of the service of said notice; provided, however, that where service is made by registered or certified mail, the date of mailing shall be the date of service. 
                  (e)  A docket shall be maintained in which every proceeding and ruling had in each case shall be indicated. 
                  (f)  (1)  The plaintiff, when he files his claim, shall deposit the sum of thirty-six dollars and fifty cents ($36.50) with the court, which sum shall cover all costs of the proceeding, including the cost of service of the notice. The deposit of cost in cases of attachment, garnishment or trover shall be thirty-six dollars and fifty cents ($36.50). If a party shall fail to pay any accrued cost, the judge shall have the power to deny said party the right to file any new case while such costs remain unpaid and, likewise, shall have the power to deny such litigant the right to proceed further in any pending case. The award of court costs, as between the parties, shall be in the discretion of the judge, and such costs shall be taxed in the cause at his discretion. 
                  (2)  Whenever a claim affidavit and bond is filed by a third party claiming personal property that has been attached or levied upon under an attachment or execution issued from the small claims division, the levying officer shall forthwith return the same to said division of the magistrate court, and the issues raised by such claim affidavit shall be heard and determined by the judge of said small claims division. The same rules of practice and procedure shall apply as in cases of affidavits of illegality. All attachment proceedings shall be tried by the judge and without a jury. 
                  (g)  (1)  The trial shall be conducted on the day set for the hearing, or at such later time as the judge may set. Immediately prior to the trial of any case, the judge shall make an earnest effort to settle the controversy by conciliation. If the judge fails to induce the parties to settle their differences without a trial, he shall proceed with the hearing on its merits. 
                  (2)  The judge shall conduct the trial in such manner as to do substantial justice between the parties according to the rules of substantive law. All rules and regulations relating to pleading, practice and procedure shall be liberally construed so as to administer justice. 
                  (3)  If the plaintiff fails to appear, the suit may be dismissed for want of prosecution, the defendant may proceed to a trial on the merits, or the case may be continued as the judge may direct. If both parties fail to appear, the judge may continue the case, order the same dismissed for want of prosecution, or make any other just and proper disposition thereof as justice may require. 
                  (h)  If any defendant has any claim against the plaintiff, the judge may require a statement of setoff to be filed, or same may be waived. If the plaintiff requires time to prepare his defense against such claim, the judge may continue the case for such purpose. If any defendant has any claim against the plaintiff which exceeds the jurisdiction of the division, he may use a part thereof to offset the claim of the plaintiff. 
                  (i)  When the judgment is to be rendered and the party against whom it is to be entered requests it, the judge shall inquire fully into the earnings and financial status of such party and shall have full discretionary power to stay the entry of judgment, to stay execution, and to order partial payments in such amounts, over such periods, and upon such terms as shall seem just under the circumstances and as will assure [ensure] a definite and steady reduction of the judgment until it is finally and completely satisfied. 
                  (j)  The judge of said small claims division shall not be obligated to collect such deferred partial payments on judgments so rendered but, if the plaintiff so requests, he may do so at the expense of the plaintiff for clerical and accounting costs incurred thereby. 
                  (k)  The Judge of the Magistrate Court of Rockdale County may, from time to time, make rules for a simple, inexpensive and speedy procedure to effectuate the purposes of this act [article] and shall have power to prescribe, modify and improve the forms to be used therein to ensure the proper administration of justice and to accomplish the purposes hereof.

                  The purpose of this Code of Ethics is to establish ethical standards of conduct for the chairperson and the members of the Rockdale County Board of Commissioners by identifying acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the community.

Further, it is essential to the proper administration and operation of the county that the members of the board of commissioners are independent and impartial; that public office or position not be used for private gain; that there be public confidence in the integrity of the board of commissioners; and that the public interest requires protection against conflicts of interest by establishing and adopting appropriate ethical standards to govern the conduct of the board of commissioners. 
                  Persons best qualified to serve in positions of public trust are essential to the efficient operation of government. This article is intended to be construed to accomplish this purpose and is to be interpreted and understood so as not to unreasonably frustrate or impede the desires or inclination to seek and serve in public office by those persons best qualified to serve.

A copy of such complaint shall immediately be forwarded by registered mail to the person against whom the complaint was filed. The complaint must be supported by affidavits based on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. All documents referred to in an affidavit(s) shall be attached to the affidavit(s). A complaint must be filed within six months of the date the alleged violation is said to have occurred, or in case of concealment or nondisclosure, within six months of the date the alleged violation should have been discovered after due diligence. In the event the ethics board makes an initial determination that a complaint is technically deficient, the board shall submit a list of deficiencies to the complainant and offer the complainant the opportunity to correct the deficiencies within seven days prior to the ethics board's investigatory review of the complaint.

If after reviewing the complaint the ethics board by majority vote determines that no specific, substantiated evidence from a credible source(s) exists to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this article or determines that no violation occurred, it may dismiss the complaint. In the event a complaint is dismissed on the basis of a deficiency in the form of the complaint, rather than upon the merits of the complaint, the complaint may be re-filed within 15 days of said dismissal if the deficiency in the form and pleading has been cured. 
                  (4)  If the ethics board determines that specific, substantiated evidence from a credible source(s) exists to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this article, certified written notice of a hearing, containing the time, date and place of such hearing, shall be given to each party by the ethics board, and a formal public hearing shall be conducted and both parties afforded an opportunity to be heard.

                  Pursuant to the delegation of authority granted to the County by O.C.G.A. § 3-3-20(b)(2)(A), the sale by licensees of alcoholic beverages, distilled spirits, wine, and malt beverages shall be lawful during the polling hours of any election; however, nothing in this section shall authorize the sale of alcoholic beverages within 250 feet of a polling place during such time as the polls are open.

                  Sec. 10-55. - Prohibition of alcoholic beverages with nudity or in adult entertainment establishments. 
                  (a)  The regulations that follow and that otherwise are contained in this Code regarding adult entertainment establishments constitute content-neutral requirements that have been carefully designed to minimize adverse impacts caused by secondary effects of these establishments. The county finds that studies in other jurisdictions demonstrating a correlation between these establishments and such negative secondary effects as diminishing market values in neighboring residential and related areas, increasing crime rates, difficulty in securing residential and related financing, an influx of patrons to these establishments from outside the immediate neighboring areas, and similar negative effects, are pertinent and relevant to the situation that exists in the county. These studies, as well as other evidence from the public and professional staff, have been carefully reviewed by the county prior to adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives. The county further finds that there is evidence considered by the county prior to adoption of these and other county regulations regarding the combined effects of adult entertainment establishments and alcohol, and showing that the combination of such activities create additional pernicious secondary effects upon surrounding communities. The county finds that adoption of regulations restricting these establishments to certain districts, barring alcohol sales within such establishments, and imposing distance and development standards is consistent with the general comprehensive planning standards and policies of the county, will reduce the negative secondary effects caused by these establishments, and will afford protection to residential uses and other uses consistent with residential uses so as to protect the public health, safety, welfare and morality while respecting and protecting the free speech rights of these establishments. The regulations in this section are adopted pursuant to, inter alia, Ga. Const. art. III, § VI, VII. 
                  (b)  The definitions contained in this article and in section 22-142 shall apply to this section. 
                  (c)  No person, association, partnership or corporation holding a license under chapter 22, article V, shall serve, sell, distribute or allow the consumption or possession of any alcoholic beverage or illegal controlled substance upon the premises of any such licensed establishment. 
                  (d)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, including but not limited to employees or an independent contractor engaged in the sale or service of food or beverages, or promotions, contests, sales, or special events, in which such person, whether an employee, or an independent contractor, patron, customer, or otherwise, exposes any portion of his specified anatomical areas as defined in section 22-142, shall be prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve or dispense alcoholic beverages within the county. Such conduct shall constitute grounds for suspension and revocation of the alcoholic beverage license of any establishment licensed pursuant to this article. 
                  (e)  This section shall not apply or prohibit the live performance of legitimate plays, operas, musicals, or ballets at mainstream theaters, concert halls, museums or licensed educational institutions, which derive less than 20 percent of yearly gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages.

                  (b)  The licensee shall be given written notice of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing along with a statement of the charge, or charges, upon which such hearing shall be made. 
                  (c)  Written notice shall be given at least three days prior to any hearing; however, shorter periods of notice shall be authorized as the board of commissioners may deem the circumstances to justify. 
                  (d)  The term "due cause" for the suspension or revocation of such license shall be defined as the violation of any laws or ordinances regulating such business or violation of regulations made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business, or any reason which would authorize the governing body to refuse the issuance of a license. 
                  (e)  The director of the department of planning and development may suspend a license issued under this article when there is cause to believe that grounds exist for revoking the license. At the request of the license holder, a hearing shall be held at a special meeting of the board of commissioners to be called within seven days after such request is filed with the county. The board of commissioners shall affirm or reverse the suspension, suspend for a definite period, or revoke the license permanently after hearing the evidence at the next regular meeting of the board of commissioners. If the decision of the director of the department of planning and development is reversed, then the license shall be returned to the licensee immediately. A license shall not be revoked except upon action by the board of commissioners. 
                  (f)  The following minimal penalties shall apply to suspension actions taken by the director and to suspension and/or revocation actions taken by the board of commissioners: 
                  (1)  For the first violation involving the licensed establishment in question for violations of county, state or federal law regarding the sale, furnishing or distribution of beer, wine or liquor by the owner or an employee of such establishment licensed by the county, the license in question shall be suspended for six continuous days, and a fine of $1,200.00 shall be imposed. 
                  (2)  For the second violation involving the licensed establishment in question within two years prior to the current citation for violations of county, state or federal law as enumerated in this section by the owner or an employee of such establishment licensed by the county, the license in question shall be suspended for 30 continuous days, and a fine of $3,000.00 shall be imposed. 
                  (3)  For a third violation involving the licensed establishment in question within two years prior to the current citation for violations of county, state or federal law as enumerated in this section by the owner or an employee of such establishment licensed by the county, the license in question shall be revoked, and a fine of $5,000.00 shall be imposed. 
                  (g)  Whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to manufacture or sell at wholesale or retail any malt beverages or wine, the county license to manufacture or deal in any such products shall thereupon be automatically revoked without any action by the board of commissioners. 
                  (h)  No person whose license has been suspended or revoked shall be entitled to a rebate of fees, taxes, or other expenses paid in conjunction with issuance of the license. 
                  (i)  An individual that works on the licensed premises beyond ten calendar days after their first work day without securing an alcoholic beverage handling permit shall be subject to a $100.00 fine.

                  (a)  It shall be unlawful for the owner of an animal or the individual in possession of the property upon which the animal is located at the time of the offense to allow that animal to bark, whine, howl, crow, or cause other sound or noise for a sustained period of time which is plainly audible to a person of ordinary hearing ability provided, however, that no conviction of this offense shall occur if the evidence demonstrates that, at the time the animal is emitting such sound or noise, a person is trespassing or threatening to trespass upon property in or upon which the animal is situated or if the noise is the result of an intentional provocation by another person. An animal for the purposes of this section shall include but not be limited to dogs, cats and fowl. 
                  (b)  For the purposes of this section, the term "sustained period of time" shall be defined as a period of time during which the animal barks, whines, howls, crows or makes noise continuously and/or incessantly for a period of 15 minutes or more, or makes such noise intermittently for 30 minutes or more. 
                  (c)  No person shall be found guilty of a violation of subsection (a) of this section unless such person shall have been given notice of the disturbing noise in accordance with the following procedure: 
                  (1)  Upon determination by any person that a violation of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section has occurred or is occurring, such person or his agent shall file a report to animal care and control which shall include the name, address, and phone number of the person filing the report; violators address, animal description and detailed complaint. An animal control officer shall respond to the complaint by leaving written or verbal warning with the violator. 
                  (2)  Subsequent to filing a complaint as set out in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the complainant video the animal making such disturbances for a period of 15 minutes or longer or intermittently for 30 minutes or more. This video is recommended that complainant take recording from deck or window of the complainant's home. The complainant cannot provoke the animal during the video recording. Audio proof will not be accepted. 
                  (3)  Along with the video proof of the disturbances the complainant shall keep a log over a period of seven days detailing the animal disturbances. The complainant or his agent shall bring video proof and copy of the log to animal control for review. 
                  [(4)]  Once animal control reviews video proof and log it will be up to the shelter manager or his/her designee to determine if proof will be substantial to issue citation for the violation. If animal control finds the proof to be substantial then a citation will be issued to the violator/animal owner and a subpoena will be issued to the complainant. Animal control cannot stand trial or serve as a witness for this violation. 
                  (d)  The penalty for a violation of this section shall be as provided in section 1-11.

                  Cross reference— Prohibition of alcoholic beverages with nudity or in adult entertainment establishments, § 10-55; zoning, ch. 130. 

                  Sec. 22-141. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  It is the purpose and intent of this article to regulate adult entertainment establishments to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the county and to establish reasonable and uniform content-neutral regulations of adult entertainment establishments within the county, thereby reducing or eliminating the adverse secondary effects from such adult entertainment establishments. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor the effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor the effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. This article is not intended to interfere with or suppress legitimate expression or any speech activities protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or the state constitution nor is it intended to license any use or activity which is otherwise prohibited or made punishable by law. 
                  (b)  The regulations that follow and that otherwise are contained in this Code regarding adult entertainment establishments constitute content-neutral requirements that have been carefully designed to minimize adverse impacts caused by secondary effects of these establishments. The county finds that studies in other jurisdictions demonstrating a correlation between these establishments and such negative secondary effects as diminishing market values in neighboring residential and related areas, increasing crime rates, difficulty in securing residential and related financing, an influx of patrons to these establishments from outside the immediate neighboring areas, and similar negative effects, are pertinent and relevant to the situation that exists in the county. These studies, as well as other evidence from the public and professional staff, has been carefully reviewed by the county prior to adoption of these regulations. The county further finds that there is evidence considered by the county prior to adoption of these and other county regulations regarding the combined effects of adult entertainment establishments and alcohol, and showing that the combination of such activities create additional pernicious secondary effects upon surrounding communities. The county finds that adoption of regulations restricting these establishments to certain districts, barring alcohol sales within such establishments, and imposing distance and development standards is consistent with the general comprehensive planning standards and policies of the county, will reduce the negative secondary effects caused by these establishments, and will afford protection to residential uses and other uses consistent with residential uses so as to protect the public health, safety, welfare and morality while respecting and protecting the free speech rights of these establishments.

                  Sec. 26-34. - Emergency management director; duties. 
                  (a)  There is hereby created the office of the emergency management director. The county chairperson shall nominate, for appointment by the director of the state emergency management agency, an emergency management director, who upon appointment becomes an employee of the county and director of the emergency management agency. 
                  (b)  Upon appointment, the emergency management director is charged: 
                  (1)  To represent the county on all matters pertaining to the emergency management agency; 
                  (2)  To take the lead in coordinating the development of countywide emergency preparedness, for example: 
                  a.  Develop an emergency and disaster operations plan for effective mobilization of all resources of the county, both private and public; 
                  b.  Prepare and recommend for approval mutual aid plans and agreements; 
                  c.  Prepare and effectuate legal action for continuity of government; 
                  d.  Coordinate and advise government departments in development and implementation of the emergency and disaster operations plans and other required agencies or groups; 
                  e.  Procure needed federal and state assistance through emergency management channels and through federal assistance programs in such areas as law enforcement, highway safety, ambulance procurement, or emergency medical services and others. 
                  (c)  During a peacetime or attack-caused emergency, the chief executive of government is charged with the protection of life and property by law and is in overall command. 
                  (d)  The emergency management director will be responsible during an emergency: 
                  (1)  To advise the county chairperson and the board of commissioners in operational situations, public and privileged information, and implementation of the emergency plan; 
                  (2)  To direct and coordinate the activities of the emergency operation center staff; and

                  It is an operational assumption of the civil preparedness program and emergency management agency that existing agencies of government will perform emergency activities related to those they perform in normal times. Auxiliary groups will be formed and trained under the direction and control of the operating department of government they are to support, and nongovernmental groups such as physicians or news media will be assigned emergency missions as necessary to develop a capability to augment or supplement existing agencies of government in responding to emergencies. A basic purpose of the local emergency management agency and its director shall be to provide for coordination of the operations of all such governmental and nongovernmental forces in emergencies, and to provide those unique civil preparedness skills and capabilities not available in existing government organizations. The emergency management director shall also inform the operating departments of government of those special conditions arising out of a nuclear attack which would call for a modification of traditional operating techniques.

                  (a)  The county emergency management agency shall be established around existing county departments and agencies, and organized support forces, as needed to provide for the effective mobilization of all resources of the county, both private and public. 
                  (b)  Existing government departments, with or without support forces, will be commanded by their regular department executives, who will name for command three successors for emergency operation purposes. 
                  (c)  Organized support forces of the emergency management agency which are required for the functions of this agency, by law and need, will be provided from the populace and will have a chief executive, who will name for command three successors for emergency operation purposes. 
                  (d)  The departments, agencies and organized support forces of the emergency management agency will be named, their emergency functions and responsibilities defined in the emergency and disaster operations plan of the county.

                  (2)  To do any act forbidden by any lawful rules or regulations issued pursuant to this article if the act is of such a nature as to give assistance to the enemy or to imperil the life or property of any inhabitant of this political subdivision or to prevent, hinder or delay the defense or protection thereof; or 
                  (3)  To wear or carry or display without authority any mark or identification specified by the emergency management agency.

When such meetings occur outside of the county, all actions taken by the local governing body shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the county.

                  Whenever any claim is made or proceeding is brought against an employee, either against him asserting personal liability for damages arising out of the performance of his duties or in any way connected therewith, whether based on negligence, violation of contract rights or violation of civil, constitutional, common law or other statutory rights, whether federal, state or local, the county shall, upon his written request, provide for his defense unless otherwise limited by the terms of this article. The provisions of this article shall not apply unless the employee provides notice in writing of any claim or proceeding to one or more members of the county board of commissioners within 30 days after the employee has notice of a claim and/or within five days after the employee has been served with process in a proceeding initiated against him.

                  Sec. 30-33. - Grounds for refusal of defense. 
                  (a)  The county shall not provide for the defense of a claim or proceeding brought against an employee if: 
                  (1)  The act or omission did not arise out of and in the course of his county employment; 
                  (2)  The employee acted or failed to act because of actual or intentional misconduct, fraud, corruption or malice; 
                  (3)  Defense of the claim or proceeding by the county would create a conflict of interest between the county and the employee; 
                  (4)  The proceeding is a criminal prosecution; provided, however, that should the county employee be acquitted or the charges otherwise dismissed by the court, then the county shall provide for the defense of the case if and only if the alleged violation arose out of the employee's duties for the county; 
                  (5)  Provision of a defense against the claim or proceeding would not be in, the best interest of the county; 
                  (6)  The employee acts or fails to act as a result of, or at a time when, his own self-indulgence substantially impaired his judgment as, for example, an officer or employee who causes damage or injury while intoxicated or under influence of drugs while on the job; 
                  (7)  The employee acts or fails to act, except in emergencies or the existence of extenuating circumstances, directly contrary to advice of the county attorney; or 
                  (8)  The employee acts or fails to act in such manner as to constitute a criminal act as, for example, the misappropriation of property or funds. 
                  (b)  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit the county from providing a defense against a claim or proceeding where there is a conflict of interest between one employee or group of employees of the county as compared with another employee or group of employees. 
                  (c)  The determinations required by subsection (a) of this section shall be made by the board of commissioners. 
                  (d)  If two or more employees or groups of employees are involved, and the interest of one employee or group of employees conflicts with the interest of another employee or group of employees, then and in such event, the board of commissioners shall specify which employee or group of employees shall be represented by the county attorney and shall authorize other employees or groups of employees to employ counsels at the expense of the county; provided, however, that the selection and compensation of any other counsel shall be subject to prior approval by the board of commissioners. 
                  (e)  Where the board of commissioners is unable to determine initially whether a defense is authorized under this section, as in the case of charges being made in the proceedings of actual or intentional misconduct, fraud, corruption or malice on the part of the employee which cannot be initially disproved to the satisfaction of the board of commissioners upon investigation, then the board of commissioners may decide that the defense be allowed by the county or that the board of commissioners may reserve judgment until the conclusion of the proceeding, before or after any appeals thereon, upon whether to reimburse the employee for any attorney's fees and court costs he may have incurred.

All compromises of claims or proceedings governed by this article shall be submitted to the board of commissioners for its prior approval and that approval shall only be sparingly granted upon legal advice and after a determination by the board of commissioners that such payment is in the best interest of the county on a case-by-case basis. 
                  (b)  Where the board has agreed to reimburse the employee for attorney's fees and court costs under section 30-33(d), the county may also provide for the payment of judgments and claims under this section. 
                  (c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, payment of judgments and claims shall be limited as follows: 
                  (1)  No sum shall be paid on behalf of any employee in any one claim or proceeding in excess of $10,000.00 for property damage, $25,000.00 in the case of any other claim or claims brought by any one claimant, and $100,000.00 for any number of claims by numerous claimants arising out of the same occurrence. 
                  (2)  No sum shall be paid under the provisions of this article for punitive or exemplary damages. 
                  (3)  No sum shall be paid under the provisions of this article unless the claimant unconditionally releases the employee and the county from any and all claims, causes of action or judgments arising out of the subject claim or proceeding. 
                  (4)  No sum will be paid under the provisions of this article unless the employee shall first pay $1,000.00 toward the total sum payable under the provisions of this article; provided, however, that this $1,000.00 shall be waived when in the opinion of the county attorney the facts of the particular case warrant such a waiver. 
                  There is excluded further from the operation of this article any claim or proceeding as to which insurance is provided by the county.

Nothing contained in this article shall be interpreted in any way to reduce or eliminate the rights of any employee of the county against any other party.

                  (a)  The board of commissioners does hereby find that: 
                  (1)  Certain studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy non-smokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. 
                  (2)  Certain studies have also found that secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer. 
                  (b)  Accordingly, the board of commissioners finds and declares that the purposes of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and private places of employment; and 
                  (2)  Provide to non-smokers the opportunity to breathe 100 percent smoke-free air in all public places and private places of employment; and 
                  (3)  Recognize that the need to breathe 100 percent smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

                  b.  For purposes of this subsection, discrimination includes: 
                  1.  A refusal to permit, at the expense of the person with disabilities, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be necessary to afford such person full enjoyment of the premises, except that, in the case of a rental, the landlord may where it is reasonable to do so condition permission for a modification on the renter's agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted; 
                  2.  A refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling; or 
                  3.  In connection with the design and construction of covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, a failure to design and construct those dwellings in such a manner that:

                  (b)  (1)  Nothing in this section, other than subsection (a)(3) of this section, shall apply to: 
                  a.  Any single-family dwelling sold or rented by an owner, if:

                  3.  Such dwelling is sold or rented: 
                  i.  Without the use in any manner of the sales or rental facilities or the sales or rental services of any real estate broker, agent, or salesperson, or of such facilities or services of any person in the business of selling or renting dwellings, or of any employee or agent of any such broker, agent, salesperson, or person; and 
                  ii.  Without the publication, posting, or mailing, after notice, of any advertisement or written notice in violation of subsection (c) of this section; but nothing in this subsection (b)(1)a.3.ii shall prohibit the use of attorneys, escrow agents, abstractors, title companies, and other such professional assistance as necessary to perfect or transfer the title; or 
                  b.  Rooms or units in dwellings containing living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families living independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains and occupies one of such living quarters as his residence. 
                  (2)  In the case of the sale of any such single-family dwelling by a private individual owner not residing in such dwelling at the time of such sale or who was not the most recent resident of such dwelling prior to such sale, the exemption granted by this subsection shall apply only with respect to one such sale within any 24-month period.

                  ARTICLE II. - HAYNES RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT 

                  Sec. 62-31. - Preamble. 
                  (a)  The county recognizes that a safe and reliable source of water is absolutely essential for the continued growth of the county and to ensure that county water needs can be met in drought conditions. The county and the authority recognize that the area's population is growing and the need for water for business and industrial uses is expanding. The county also recognizes that available water resources are limited, that environmental concerns impose restrictions on water availability, and that the cost of developing safe and reliable water resources continues to escalate. The county recognizes that the providing of recreational opportunities including rowing, canoeing, fishing, birdwatching and other activities, inclusive of competitive events related to such activities, is critical to the area's public needs and quality of life, in light of growing concerns for the realization of public health through exercise and recreation. 
                  (b)  The county has determined that the most practical method of ensuring a safe and reliable source of water for the purposes set out in subsection (a) of this section is to construct a water impoundment project on the waters of Big Haynes Creek, within the confines of the county, which shall be known as the Big Haynes Creek Reservoir. The county recognizes the need to adopt rules, regulations and take such action as is necessary to protect the quality of water in the Big Haynes Creek Reservoir. Therefore, the county has devised this Big Haynes Creek Reservoir Management Plan and Rules and Regulations Concerning Public Use of Big Haynes Creek Reservoir. The purpose of this article and the associated rules and regulations is to set out the activities permitted in the adjacent areas as well as the activities prohibited in those areas. 
                  (Code 1978, § 9-7001) 
                  Sec. 62-32. - Purpose and objectives. 
                  The primary purposes of this article are to set out the parameters to preserve and protect the quality of water in Big Haynes Creek Reservoir and for the utilization by the public of the recreational opportunities allowed by this article. Additional purposes of this article are to furnish guidance and regulations for the management, protection, and preservation of the reservoir's shoreline and environment; to properly establish and maintain acceptable fish and wildlife habitat, aesthetic quality and natural environmental conditions; to provide for protection of the project; and to promote the safe and healthful use of the project and project lands. Big Haynes Creek Reservoir is intended to provide a reliable raw water supply to the surrounding geographic area. The paramount and overriding objective of this article is the protection of the quality of water in the reservoir. The secondary objective of this article is to provide the recreational opportunities subject to certain restrictions established to ensure that recreational opportunities will not adversely impact the water quality of the project. 
                  (Code 1978, § 9-7002) 
                  Sec. 62-33. - Authority and jurisdiction. 
                  This article and all restrictions imposed in this article shall be administered, exercised and enforced by the resource manager, his designated agent, code enforcement officers and deputy sheriff officers of the sheriff's department. Nothing contained in this article shall be considered a delegation of the county's power to enforce any of its ordinances or regulations within or upon the project. Agents and employees of the county are authorized to assist in the enforcement of this plan as set out in this article. 
                  (Code 1978, § 9-7003) 
                  Sec. 62-34. - Permits and fees. 
                  (a)  As with any large multiuse facility, the demand for space on Big Haynes Creek Reservoir must be regulated to encourage proper utilization and promote public safety. It is the intent of this section to describe the activities that are allowed and what permits are applicable. All permit requests are subject to review and may be granted only if public law and regulatory guidance are met. Violations of permit conditions or unauthorized uses will result in corrective action that may include termination of permits, removal of private property, and/or other legal action. Big Haynes Creek Reservoir is a county-owned facility that will require permits to be issued by the reservoir manager for the following types of activity: 
                  (1)  Access to public recreation areas; 
                  (2)  Special event activities; 
                  (3)  Specified acts. 
                  (b)  The fees associated with these permits and the management and enforcement of these permits will be subject to the provisions of the official Rules and Regulations for Big Haynes Creek Reservoir as adopted by the county. 
                  (1)  Access to public recreation areas. Subject to the Rules and Regulations for Big Haynes Creek Reservoir, all visitors to the recreation areas shall obtain a one-day permit, multiday permit or annual permit from the reservoir manager. All rights and privileges available to the permittee shall be addressed in the rules and regulations and shall be posted for public information at each area. The reservoir manager shall operate the permitting program in accordance with the rules and regulations in order to provide for the public health, safety and welfare. 
                  (2)  Special event activities. A permit will be required for recreational use of reservoir recreation areas when more than 12 persons or vessels are involved in an activity. Generally, it is not the intent of this program to deny public use of the project. It is necessary to ensure that: 
                  a.  Environmental issues are addressed; 
                  b.  Regulatory guidance is reviewed; 
                  c.  Public safety is considered; 
                  d.  Space is available; 
                  e.  The rights of others are not affected; and 
                  f.  The activity can, in fact, be authorized in accordance with all laws and regulations. 
                  Permits issued by the reservoir manager for special events do not relieve the permittee from obtaining similar local or state authorizations that may be required. Examples of events for which a special event activity permit may be required are: festivals, concerts, exhibitions and fishing tournaments. 
                  (3)  Specified acts within the subzone W-RB. Certain activities which are allowed within the W-RB subzone area will require issuance of a permit prior to engaging in the allowed activity. The allowed activities and those which require a permit are defined by section 62-37. A permit application will be provided by the department of water resources through the office of the director of water resources and will require submission of information detailing the requested activity inclusive of a completion schedule; location of the activity; the type of equipment to be utilized and a plan for restoration, if necessary, inclusive of revegetation and/or the application of mulch. The permit application shall be prepared and submitted by a state registered forester, professional engineer or landscape architect in accordance with best management practices for a natural or enhanced buffer. The permit application will be reviewed by the office of the director of water resources and shall be issued as applied for or denied by the director of the department of water resources or his designee. The permit shall be issued, comments provided by the director of the department of water resources or denied within 15 working days of submission by the applicant. If the permit is denied, the applicant may appeal the decision of the director of the department of water resources to the board of commissioners in writing within ten days of the date of denial. If the board of commissioners fails to act upon the appeal within 30 days, the permit shall stand approved. The department of water resources will be responsible for enforcement of the permit.

                  Sec. 62-35. - Boundary control. 
                  The project will be surveyed and monumented during the land and easement acquisition phase. Boundaries of land owned in fee-simple by the county, subzone W-RW, shall follow the shoreline of the reservoir at the normal pool elevation of 735 feet mean sea level. 
                  (Code 1978, § 9-7005) 
                  Sec. 62-36. - Management policies. 
                  The reservoir manager shall ensure that the following policies, as adopted by the board of commissioners, are enforced: 
                  (1)  Water quality management. 
                  a.  The primary function of the reservoir is that of supplying a safe and reliable source of drinking water which requires that a comprehensive approach to water quality protection is assured. The reservoir manager shall be responsible for the management and control of water quality within the project in accordance with this article and the adopted Rules and Regulations for Big Haynes Creek Reservoir. 
                  b.  Water quality in the nonreservoir portion (W-NR) of the watershed will be assured by the provisions of this article and administration by the department of public services and engineering. Enforcement of this article in the W-NR area will be provided by code enforcement officers of the department of public services and engineering. 
                  c.  The assurance of water quality from the areas of the watershed outside the jurisdictional boundaries of the county will be the responsibility of the board of commissioners, the reservoir manager and the department of public services and engineering. All agreements with the other jurisdictions in the watershed must be self regulated. 
                  d.  However, the county will take the lead in a program of education, technical support and planning with each jurisdiction within the watershed to provide a team approach for water quality protection. 
                  e.  The county recognizes that one of the most relevant tasks is the establishment of a water quality monitoring program to identify any potential problem areas before they become major problems. A water quality monitoring program will be implemented prior to water impoundment. The program will be reviewed on an annual basis in terms of its adequacy. 
                  f.  Cleaning vessels with soaps and solvents on the shoreline pollutes the lake. This activity and the unauthorized use of insecticides, herbicides, pre-emergent and fertilizers are prohibited by regulation. Application of these chemicals and construction on adjacent private property may have strong potential to disperse pollutants into the lake. Instances of sedimentation and chemical pollution will be investigated. 
                  g.  Nuisance aquatic weeds may invade the project. The transport of such weeds is possible and low areas may eventually have seasonal problems unless the general public inspects and cleans their boats and trailers after visiting other waterways known to have aquatic weed pests. Of most concern are hydrilla and Eurasian watermilfoil. 
                  (2)  Fisheries management. 
                  a.  The fisheries management program is primarily implemented to enhance and maintain habitats to provide for a sustained recreational fishery. Habitat enhancement is accomplished by conducting various practices such as stabilizing spawning habitats and installation of fish attractors. Maintenance of productive fishery habitats is achieved in part by maintaining an active water quality program. Board of commissioners personnel shall cooperate with the state environmental protection division to resolve water quality problems. Also, the board cooperates with the county health department to correct septic tank pollution and with state engineering department and county department of public services and engineering to resolve soil erosion problems. 
                  b.  Cooperation with the wildlife resources division is absolutely necessary to manage fish resources. The board of commissioners is obligated to assist in several ways such as fish kill investigation, habitat enhancement, and, occasionally, field monitoring of fish populations. The reservoir manager may enter into cooperative fish attractor projects to provide increased recreational use of sport fishery. 
                  c.  The wildlife resources division will provide a consultant role to provide technical advice and guidance throughout the design, construction and maintenance of the project. 
                  (3)  Wildlife management. 
                  a.  Successful wildlife management at Big Haynes Creek Reservoir can better be achieved by integrating wildlife programs with effective forest management. The goal of wildlife management is aimed at developing, improvising, and maintaining vegetative communities that will serve diverse wildlife. This object is established since different wildlife associate with different plant types. Fulfillment of this goal will provide better opportunities to observe wildlife and to engage in other nonconsumptive uses such as photography and nature study. The maintenance of the reservoir buffer will provide a wildlife corridor around the reservoir. This will allow wildlife to move around the reservoir and provide access to the water's edge. 
                  b.  Wildlife population regulation, especially game species, is the responsibility of the state department of natural resources. The board of commissioners shall cooperate to support state efforts with population regulation in as far as providing habitat for the production of game species for off-site utilization and assisting with the control of pest species. 
                  (4)  Endangered species management. It is the intention of the board of commissioners to conserve threatened and endangered species occurring on the project and the ecosystems on which those species depend. No disturbance of threatened or endangered species on the project will be allowed. 
                  (5)  Wetlands management. The wetlands associated with Big Haynes Creek Reservoir provide a number of natural biological functions. Maintenance of these wetland areas is an important component of the reservoir management plan. All wetland habitats in the project will be preserved. To maintain wetlands, no alteration of wetlands within the project will be allowed. 
                  (6)  Forest management. 
                  a.  Forest resources of the project shall be managed to ensure and enhance water quality objectives, promote stormwater infiltration and sheet flow and prevent soil erosion. 
                  b.  Reservoir buffer area forest and vegetative management objectives are to sustain a healthy forest canopy, understory and herbaceous layer since the objective is to maintain the reservoir buffer area in a natural or near-natural state. Activities within the reservoir buffer will be subject to the issuance of appropriate use permits and/or land disturbance permits issued by the reservoir manager. 
                  c.  Public recreation area will be subject to forest management practices which will be appropriate for the level of recreational use of the specified area as trails, picnic areas, special bird watching areas, scenic views, the public boating recreational facility, bank fishing areas, etc. 
                  (7)  Cultural, historical and archeological. It is the further intent of the board of commissioners to protect historical sites and recover historical and archeological data. No specific use or alteration of the project will be allowed unless a cultural resources survey has been conducted. Should the survey identify sites of cultural significance, then no disturbance will be allowed unless mitigated with the approval of the state historical preservation officer. 
                  (8)  Buffer management. Forest and vegetative management of the reservoir buffer area (subzone W-RB) shall be practiced to sustain a healthy forest plant community consisting of a canopy, understory and herbaceous layer for the purpose of maintaining the area as a natural or enhanced vegetated area around the reservoir. Certain activities within the reservoir buffer area will be subject to the issuance of activity permits issued by the office of the director of the department of water resources. The buffer area will be managed to enhance water quality objectives, promote stormwater infiltration and prevent soil erosion. Land disturbance, subject to appropriate permitting from the department of public services and engineering, may be allowed if the disturbance is necessary to achieve water quality objectives including but not limited to the prevention of soil erosion, sheet erosion and/or channelization. In connection with the management of the reservoir buffer area (subzone W-RB) and the enforcement of this article, the department of water resources and all code enforcement officers shall consider and be guided by the following: 
                  a.  A goal in management of the W-RD is to produce a multistory plant community with a canopy layer, including but not limited to, pine, oak, hickory, maple, tulip poplar, beech, sycamore, an understory of developing canopy shade tolerant species and normal understory species, including but not limited to dogwood, American holly, sourwood, black gum, persimmon, and other Piedmont trees depending on the aspect and slope of hydrology. 
                  b.  The goal of minimum cover in the reservoir buffer area (W-RB) is a basal area of 60 square feet per acre. The number of trees desirable in a forested buffer area depends upon the distribution of tree size. A continuous or near-continuous canopy should be maintained as this ensures an intact forest floor. Planted trees should be of sufficient size to be protected from animal damage so that they achieve rapid growth and meet the overall objective of maintaining a healthy and vigorous forest. 
                  c.  If there are no trees within the vertical portion of a gap in the overstory of the buffer, the planting of new trees or a tree should be considered. If there is an opening in the canopy larger than 25 feet by 25 feet and there are no suitable understory trees in a position to fill the gap, two new trees should be planted. For purposes of this section only, a suitable understory tree shall be defined as any tree normally found in an overstory, such as poplar, oak, hickory, maple, birch, willow and pine, then standing more than five feet tall with a healthy crown. 
                  d.  Trees with high wildlife value should be considered for planting in forested areas. 
                  e.  Prolific sprouting and fast growing species, such as sweetgum, with relatively short lifespans compared to other species, which have limited wildlife value, and often crowd out more desirable species, should be discouraged. 
                  f.  A moderately dense canopy producing sufficient leaf litter to maintain an intact forest floor is sufficient to provide water quality benefits expected of a forested buffer area. 
                  g.  The removal of forest humus or mulch shall be permitted only when reasonably necessary for construction of vegetated swales or strips in an effort to prevent or remedy soil erosion. 
                  h.  Land disturbing activity to obtain scenic vistas or establish lawns shall not be allowed. 
                  i.  Man-induced changes to a forest, under certain conditions and circumstances, may enhance wildlife habitat and aesthetics by accelerating the natural evolution of a forest without harming water quality.

                  Sec. 62-40. - Amendments. 
                  (a)  The board of commissioners is charged with protecting and managing Big Haynes Creek Reservoir within its scope of authority while serving the needs of the general public. It is the intent of the management plan in this article to provide the most benefit to the public and to balance the needs against the physical limitations and natural qualities of the project. In formulating the plan, present and future needs were considered. The reservoir manager will continually monitor the needs of lake users and recommend revisions that will minimize conflicts between various interests. Minor and major changes will be coordinated with the approval of the state department of natural resources. In advance of adopting a major revision to this plan, all proposed revisions will be publicly announced for review and comment prior to being considered at a public hearing conducted by the board of commissioners. 
                  (b)  The plan will be subject to periodic reevaluation and individual segments may therefore need reevaluation and revision.

                  Sec. 66-4. - Loitering generally. 
                  (a)  A person commits the offense of loitering when the person is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. 
                  (b)  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a sheriff's deputy shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself or herself and explain his or her presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the deputy failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

                  Sec. 66-5. - Loitering for purpose of procuring others to engage in sexual acts for hire. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter in public for the purpose of soliciting or procuring others to engage in any sexual acts for hire. 
                  (Ord. No. 0-2006-34, § 2, 12-21-2006) 
                  Sec. 66-6. - Loitering for purposes of engaging in drug-related activity. 
                  (a)  Legislative findings and intent. 
                  (1)  The Rockdale County Board of Commissioners finds that the increase throughout the county of loitering in public places for the purposes of unlawful drug-related activity, or in effect, "open air" drug dealing, has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses. This activity has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of fear and intimidation and disorder. 
                  (2)  Loitering for purposes of unlawful drug-related activity usually includes a dominate presence of those persons engaging in such activity by approaching pedestrians, encouraging the presence of vehicle and pedestrian traffic for the purpose of unlawful drug-related activity in and out of residential areas, to or from motor vehicles or in parking lots. Such presence carries with it an implicit threat to visitors and residents to avoid the use of these public places. The avoidance of such places by law-abiding citizens leads to an increased opportunity for the unlawful criminal activity and furthers the decay of the neighborhood. 
                  (3)  The county has a strong interest in ensuring that citizens feel safe in their neighborhoods, in safeguarding the economic vitality of its business districts, and in preserving public places for their intended purposes. 
                  (4)  This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising their right to assemble or engage in any other constitutionally protected activity. This section applies to all persons with the requisite intent to induce another to engage in unlawful drug-related activity. 
                  (b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, as defined in section 66-4, in or near any thoroughfare, place open to the public, or any public or private place in order to induce, entice, solicit or procure another to engage in unlawful drug-related activity. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of this section "unlawful drug-related activity" means conduct which constitutes an offense defined in O.C.G.A. title 16, chapter 13, as amended; conduct which constitutes complicity to commit such an offense by, for example, acting as a lookout; or conduct which constitutes conspiracy to commit such an offense. 
                  (2)  For the purposes of this section "public place" means an area open to the public or exposed to public view and includes streets, sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles, whether moving or not, and buildings open to the general public, including those which serve food or drink, or provide entertainment, and the doorways and entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them. 
                  (c)  A sheriff's deputy who observes a person loitering under circumstances that provide the deputy with a reasonable basis to believe unlawful drug-related activity is occurring or has occurred may detain the individual for the purpose of investigating whether the person is in violation of this section. 
                  (d)  A sheriff's deputy may not detain an individual under this section unless both of the following elements are satisfied: 
                  (1)  The person engages in one or more of the following behaviors: 
                  a.  The person passes or receives from a passer-by, bystander or person in a motor vehicle money, objects having characteristics consistent with controlled substances, and/or an envelope, bag or other container that could reasonably contain such objects or money;

Business license suspensions and revocations shall be governed by chapter 22, article II, and the failure to comply with this article and pay all required occupation taxes shall constitute grounds for suspension or revocation thereunder.

                  (b)  If the finance director deems it necessary in order to facilitate initial registration under this article of persons engaged in business or prior to the date of imposition of tax as set forth in this article, he may prescribe provisions therefor other than those provided in this section.

                  (f)  Extension of time for filing a return and paying tax.

If any person fails to make a return, the finance director shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the person, or as the case may be, of the amount of the total rentals in this county which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the person failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is in the finance director's possession or may come into his possession. Upon the basis of the estimate, the finance director shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid the county, adding to the sum thus arrived at a penalty equal to 15 percent thereof. One or more determinations may be made for one or more than one period. 
                  (b)  Manner of computation; offsets; interest.

                  (e)  Giving of notice; manner of service. Promptly after making this determination, the finance director shall give to the person written notice to be served personally or by certified mail in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency determination.

                  (a)  Security, finance director may exact; amount of sale; notice of sale; return of surplus. The finance director, whenever he deems it necessary to ensure compliance with this article, may require any person subject thereto to deposit with him such security as the director may determine. The amount of the security shall be fixed by the finance director, but shall not be greater than twice the person's estimated average liability for the period for which he files returns, determined in such a manner as the director deems proper, or $10,000.00, whichever amount is the lesser. The amount of the security may be increased by the finance director subject to the limitations provided in this article. The finance director may sell the security at public auction, with the approval of the board of commissioners, if it becomes necessary to do so in order to recover any tax or any amount required to be collected, interest or penalty due. Notice of the sale may be served upon the person who deposited the security personally or by certified mail; if by certified mail, service shall be addressed to the person at his address as it appears in the records of the finance director. Upon any sale, any surplus above the amounts due shall be returned to the person who deposited the security. 
                  (b)  Notice of delinquency to persons holding credits or property of delinquent; time for; duty of persons so notified. If any person is delinquent in the payment of the amount required to be paid by him, or if a determination has been made against him which remains unpaid, the finance director may, not later than three years after the payment became delinquent, give notice thereof by registered mail to all persons in the county having in their possession or under their control any credits or other personal property belonging to the delinquent, or owing any debts to the delinquent. After receiving the notice, the persons so notified shall neither transfer nor make any other disposition of the credits, other personal property or debts in their possession or under their control at the time they receive the notice until the finance director consents to a transfer or disposition or until 20 days elapse after the receipt of the notice, advise the finance director of all these credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession, under their control or owing by them. 
                  (c)  Action for tax; time for. At any time within three years after any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected becomes due and payable and at any time within three years after the delinquency of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected, the finance director may bring an action in the courts of this state, or any other state or of the United States in the name of the county to collect the amount delinquent together with penalties and interest, court fees, filing fees, attorney's fees and other legal fees incident thereto. 
                  (d)  Duty of successors or assignees of operator to withhold tax from purchase money. If any operator liable for any amount under this article sells out his business or quits the business, his successors or assigns shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase price to cover this amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the finance director showing that he has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due. 
                  (e)  Liability for failure to withhold; certificate of notice of amount due; time to enforce successor's liability. If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold an amount of the purchase price as required, he becomes personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within 30 days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, the finance director shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of the director of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the director to mail the notice will release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold the purchase price as provided in this subsection. The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells out his business or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs later. 
                  (f)  Refund of tax, penalty or interest paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected. Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty or interest has been paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the county under this article, it may be refunded provided a verified claim in writing therefor, stating the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the finance director within three years from the date of payment. The claim shall be audited and shall be made on forms provided by the finance director. If the claim is approved by the finance director and the board of commissioners, the excess amount collected or paid may be refunded or may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person from whom it was collected or by whom paid; and the balance may be refunded to this person, his administrators or executors.

                  (b)  Rules and regulations.

                  (e)  Authority to require reports; contents. In administration of the tax, the director may require the filing of reports by any person or class of persons having in his or their possession or custody information relating to rentals of guestrooms which are subject to the tax. The reports shall be filed with the finance director when he requires and shall set forth the rental charged for each occupancy, the date or dates of occupancy and such other information as the director may require. 
                  (f)  Disclosure of business of operators; limitation on rule. The finance director or any person having an administrative duty under this article shall not make known in any manner the business affairs, operations or information obtained by an audit of books, papers, records, financial reports, equipment and other facilities of any operator or any other person visited or examined in the discharge of official duty, or the amount or source of income, profits, losses or expenditures, or any particulars thereof, set forth or disclosed in any return, or permit any return or copy thereof or any book containing any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person not having that administrative duty under this article. Successors, receivers, trustees, executors, administrators, assignees and guarantors, if directly interested, may be given information as to the items included in the measure and amount of unpaid tax or amounts of tax required to be collected, interest and penalties.

                  (1)  In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source by the department, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
                  (2)  In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the water purveyor's system which have been subject to deterioration in quality. 
                  (3)  In the case of premises having (1) internal cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected or protected against, or (2) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line. 
                  (4)  In the case of any premises where there is pollution or polluted water that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve backflow prevention assembly. 
                  (5)  In the case of any premises where there is any contamination which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants. 
                  (6)  In the case of any premises where there are actual or potential unprotected cross connections, the public water system shall be protected by an approved backflow prevention assembly at the water service connection. 
                  (7)  In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly on each water service connection to the premises.

                  Sec. 98-90. - Wastewater permit authorization when no availability exists. 
                  (a)  Except as authorized in subsection (b), no domestic or nondomestic wastewater connection permit shall be issued unless wastewater plant availability or wastewater system availability, as defined in section 98-20, exist. 
                  If wastewater plant availability does not exist then that particular plant can only accept wastewater and issue connection permits under restricted conditions, pursuant to subsection (b). Restriction of plant capacity when no plant availability exists is required to ensure that the critical needs and the best interest of Rockdale County are addressed during the period required to reduce the wastewater treatment plant's capacity utilization to less than 95.00 percent. Once the wastewater treatment plant's capacity utilization is less than 95.00 percent of its authorized flow, provided that the remaining wastewater treatment plant system's authorized flow is at least 50,000 GPD, then the restrictions shall be removed and sewer connection permits made available to the general public. 
                  If wastewater plant availability does not exist for two or more plants within the same wastewater treatment plant system, then the total available flow capacity within the county wastewater system must be evaluated to determine whether wastewater system availability exists. 
                  (b)  If wastewater plant availability or wastewater system availability does not exist, the director may authorize wastewater connection permits only for the following categories of users, subject to the restrictions listed below: development authorities located in Rockdale County or the City of Conyers; the Conyers-Rockdale Economic Development Authority; the Rockdale County Community Revitalization and Improvement Program; Rockdale County Sewer Relief and Residential Construction Support Program, which shall be used to provide sewer service to residential users with failing septic tank systems that cannot be feasibly repaired as determined by the county's health department, and, for new individual single-family detached residential users. 
                  Under no circumstances shall wastewater connection permits authorized by this subsection result in a condition in which remaining system authorized flow within a wastewater treatment plant system is 50,000 GPD or less. 
                  When "no wastewater system availability" exists, the following restrictions and allocation plans shall also apply to the remaining five percent of the county wastewater system's total capacity: 
                  (1)  Requests for wastewater connection permits authorized by this subsection shall not exceed five percent of the total remaining flow capacity within the county wastewater system, which includes the required capacity reservation of 50,000 GPD. 
                  (2)  Requests for wastewater connection permits by the Rockdale County Community Revitalization and Improvement Program shall be limited to 23 percent of the remaining five percent of the county wastewater system's total capacity. 
                  (3)  Requests for wastewater connection permits from the Rockdale County Sewer Relief and Residential Construction Support Program shall be limited to one percent of the remaining five percent of the county wastewater system's total capacity. 
                  (4)  Requests for wastewater connection permits from the Conyers-Rockdale Economic Development Authority shall not exceed 51 percent of the remaining five percent of the county wastewater system's total capacity. 
                  (c)  Requests for wastewater connection permits by a development authority identified in subsection (b) shall be subject to each of the following: 
                  (1)  Said requests shall be approved only by an intergovernmental agreement, which agreement may address connection to the county wastewater and water systems, CCR charges and other cost recovery fees, and other provisions to adequately protect the best interest of the water and wastewater systems; 
                  (2)  Said requests shall be accompanied by a resolution of the authority authorizing the request and certifying that the request is necessary to achieve unique and extraordinary revitalization, development or redevelopment within its jurisdiction consistent with all state and local laws applicable to the authority; and 
                  (3)  Said requests shall not exceed 20,000 GPD per development authority. 
                  All requests for wastewater connection permits under subsection (b) shall adhere to the application and review requirements of this chapter, including article III and the connection requirements set forth in article I, except as otherwise provided in an intergovernmental agreement under subsection (c)(1).

The procedure to obtain wastewater allocation and a connection permit for an individual single family residential unit on a lawful lot of record existing prior to March 28, 2007, shall require the requesting party to submit a completed application for wastewater service and connection as provided by Rockdale Water Resources. Applications will not be provided to the requesting party or accepted by Rockdale Water Resources if wastewater availability does not exist at the time of request for or submission of the application. Neither the determination of wastewater availability status nor the providing or acceptance of an application to the requesting party shall constitute any right whatsoever to a wastewater allocation or otherwise bind the county to provide wastewater service to the project. The application must be submitted to Rockdale Water Resources for review and approval. All application fees must be tendered with the application. If the application is approved by Rockdale Water Resources consistent with all requirements of this chapter, a wastewater allocation will be assigned for the requesting unit. No wastewater allocation shall be assigned unless wastewater availability exists on the date of assignment. Following assignment of allocation, and upon payment by the requesting party of all charges and fees, including CCR, the allocation shall be finalized and the wastewater connection permit validated by Rockdale Water Resources. 
                  b.  Process for all other projects not requiring preliminary plat. The procedure to obtain wastewater allocation and a connection permit for a project for which a preliminary plat is not required by Chapter 302 of the UDO shall require the requesting party to first obtain and submit a project description form as provided by Rockdale Water Resources. The project description form will not be accepted by Rockdale Water Resources if wastewater availability does not exist at the time of request for or submission of said form. Upon tender of a completed project description form to Rockdale Water Resources, the requesting party will be required to attend a joint pre-design meeting which will be scheduled by the department of public services and engineering and include Rockdale Water Resources. If the requesting party successfully completes pre-design review by appropriate county departments and if wastewater availability exists for said project, the requesting party will be issued an application form, as provided by Rockdale Water Resources, for wastewater service and connection. Neither the determination of wastewater availability status nor the providing or acceptance of an application to the requesting party shall constitute any right whatsoever to a wastewater allocation or otherwise bind the county to provide wastewater service to the project. The completed wastewater service and connection application will be accepted by Rockdale Water Resources only with concurrent submittal of land disturbance and construction plans and payment of all required charges and fees. If the application is approved by Rockdale Water Resources consistent with all requirements of this chapter, a wastewater allocation will be assigned for the project. No wastewater allocation shall be assigned unless wastewater availability exists on the date of assignment. Following assignment of allocation, and upon payment by the requesting party of all charges and fees, including CCR, the allocation shall be finalized and the wastewater connection permit validated by Rockdale Water Resources.

                  1.  The requesting party shall obtain and complete a project description form as provided by Rockdale Water Resources. The project description form will not be accepted by Rockdale Water Resources if wastewater availability does not exist at the time of request for or submission of said form. 
                  2.  Upon tender of a completed project description form to Rockdale Water Resources, the requesting party will be required to attend a joint pre-design meeting which will be scheduled by the department of public services and engineering and include Rockdale Water Resources. The project description form shall be submitted no later than 48 hours prior to the scheduled pre-design meeting. 
                  3.  If the requesting party successfully completes pre-design review by appropriate county departments and if wastewater availability exists for said project, the requesting party will be issued an application form, as provided by Rockdale Water Resources, for wastewater service and connection. Neither the determination of wastewater availability status nor the providing or acceptance of an application to the requesting party shall constitute any right whatsoever to a wastewater allocation or otherwise bind the county to provide wastewater service to the project. 
                  4.  Upon successful completion of steps 1. through 3. above, the requesting party shall proceed with the process necessary to secure a preliminary plat as provided by Chapter 302 of the UDO. The preliminary plat shall be submitted to the public services and engineering department in accordance with Chapter 302. Technical review of the preliminary plat is required from both public services and engineering and Rockdale Water Resources. Upon approval of technical review of the preliminary plat by all departments and prior to the submission of the preliminary plat to the Conyers Rockdale Planning Commission for hearing and action, the requesting party shall submit the completed application form referenced in paragraph (iii) above to Rockdale Water Resources. If the application is approved by Rockdale Water Resources consistent with all requirements of this chapter, a wastewater allocation will be assigned for the project. No wastewater allocation shall be assigned unless wastewater availability exists on the date of assignment. Following assignment of allocation, and upon payment by the requesting party of all charges and fees, including CCR, the allocation shall be finalized and the wastewater connection permit validated by Rockdale Water Resources. The validated wastewater connection permit shall be immediately transmitted by the requesting party to the department of public services and engineering. Said transmittal must occur prior to the meeting of the Conyers Rockdale Planning Commission for which the preliminary plat is presented for approval. Failure by the requesting party to secure and transmit the validated wastewater connection permit prior to the planning commission meeting in question will result in automatic termination of the wastewater allocation and the wastewater connection permit and denial of the preliminary plat, provided that the planning commission shall have the authority to defer final action on the preliminary plat for good cause shown until its next regularly scheduled meeting and provided further that no more than one such deferral shall be authorized and that the 60 day refund period set forth in subsection 98-94(a) shall be tolled for the period of said deferral. 
                  5.  The decision on the final preliminary plat approval shall be made by the Conyers Rockdale Planning Commission in accordance with the applicable requirements of Chapter 302 and this chapter.

                  Sec. 98-94. - Wastewater system charges and fees. 
                  (a)  Capital cost recovery charge. All wastewater allocations shall be assessed a capital cost recovery charge ("CCR"). The CCR applicable to the wastewater allocation and connection permit shall be paid by the requesting party in accordance with the applicable provisions of section 98-91 of this article. In the event the CCR is not paid at the time specified by section 98-91 of this article, the wastewater allocation for which the CCR is due will be denied and become null and void, will not be allocated to the requesting party, and the county will not be bound to provide wastewater service to the project in question. 
                  A partial refund of the CCR paid to the county may be secured by the requesting party subject to the provisions of this paragraph. Ninety percent of the CCR will be refunded to the requesting party if a written request for refund is received by Rockdale Water Resources within 60 days from the date of issuance of the validated wastewater connection permit. Ten percent of the CCR shall be nonrefundable. If no written request for refund is received by the Rockdale Water Resources within said 60-day period, all of the capital cost recovery charges shall become the property of and be retained by Rockdale County for uses associated with its wastewater system and no refund of any kind shall be authorized. 
                  (b)  Wastewater availability fee. Upon the issuance of a validated wastewater connection permit, Rockdale Water Resources shall assign a specified number of sewer taps to the allocation set forth in said permit. In the event any sewer tap so assigned is not connected physically to the assigned domestic or nondomestic structure within three years from the date of issuance of the validated wastewater connection permit, each of the unconnected sewer taps will be assessed a monthly wastewater availability fee ("WAF"). The WAF will be equal to the monthly charge in effect at the time of assessment for the treatment of 6,000 gallons of wastewater by the county. The WAF will be assessed on a monthly basis until the sewer tap is physically connected to a structure and the account for said structure is activated for wastewater service. In the event the wastewater allocation represented by an unconnected sewer tap is surrendered to Rockdale Water Resources, no further WAF shall be incurred for that sewer tap. There shall be no refund issued for such returned wastewater allocations or the associated sewer taps. 
                  (c)  Pump station maintenance fee. A fee shall be assessed for pump stations to provide the county a means of funding pump station operating costs during the initial years of operation. 
                  (d)  Application, administrative, inspection and other fees. Additional fees may be charged and collected for applications, inspections, special administrative processes, and other matters, all as established by the board of commissioners.

Any laws or regulations promulgated by the State of Georgia relative to the construction or use of wastewater facilities which are more strict than the regulations provided in this Code are incorporated herein by reference, and such regulations may be enforced by the county. 
                  (b)  Federal pretreatment standards. 
                  (1)  The federal government has adopted regulations governing wastewater discharges from certain industries into publicly owned wastewater treatment works. These federal regulations are generally referred to as the federal pretreatment standards or the federal categorical pretreatment standards, as set forth in 40 CFR 403 et seq. Any portion of these federal standards which are more strict than the regulations provided in this Code are incorporated herein by reference, and such regulations may be enforced by the county. 
                  (2)  It is the affirmative obligation of all industrial users regulated by the federal pretreatment standards, inclusive of the federal categorical pretreatment standards, to comply with the federal standards whether or not the industry has received notification from the county or any other jurisdiction of the existence and nature of the federal standards. 
                  (c)  Modifications to federal pretreatment standards. 
                  (1)  From time to time the federal government may alter existing federal pretreatment standards or promulgate new standards. None of the provisions contained in this Code shall prevent the timely implementation of new or altered federal standards by the industries to whom the new or altered standards apply. Where new or altered federal standards are more strict than the standards presently being imposed by the county, the county may, without prejudice, immediately revise any industrial wastewater discharge permits to reflect the new or altered standards. If the industrial user is unable to immediately conform to the new or altered standards, a reasonable schedule for compliance shall be provided by the director of the department of water resources. 
                  (2)  Where the county's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the county may apply to EPD for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. Consistent removal shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in 40 CFR 403.7(c)(2), General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution, promulgated pursuant to the Clean Water Act, as amended. The county may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the State of Georgia Environmental Protection Division is obtained.

Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under section 98-162, whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the county a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs a through g of this subsection. Where reports containing this information already have been submitted to the EPD or EPA in compliance with the requirement of 40 CFR 128.140 (b) (1977), the industrial user will not be required to submit this information again. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the county a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs a through e of this subsection. New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in paragraphs d and e of this subsection: 
                  a.  Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners; 
                  b.  Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility; 
                  c.  Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification of the operations carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes; 
                  d.  Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
                  1.  Regulated process streams; and 
                  2.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR Part 403.6 (e) (See subsection (e) of this section); and 
                  3.  The county may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
                  e.  Measurement of pollutants. 
                  1.  The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process; 
                  2.  In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations; 
                  3.  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The control authority may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional composite sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may he obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged; 
                  4.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph; 
                  5.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of section 403.6(e) [40 CFR Part 403.6 (e)] in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with section 403.6(e) [40 CFR Part 403.6 (e)] this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority; 
                  6.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the administrator; 
                  7.  The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; 
                  8.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is a representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
                  f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user (as defined in section 98-72) and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (OandM) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements; 
                  g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or OandM will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or OandM. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
                  1.  Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR Part 403.7), the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR Part 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally difference factors variance (40 CFR Part 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by subsection (i)(2) below, the information required by paragraphs (i)(2)d and e below shall pertain to the modified limits. 
                  2.  If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR Part 403.7), the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR Part 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally difference factors variance (40 CFR Part 403.13) after the user submits the report required by subsection (i)(2) below, any necessary amendments to the information requested by subsection (i)(2)d and e below shall be submitted by the user to the control authority within 60 days after the modified limit is approved. 
                  (3)  Compliance schedule for meeting categorical pretreatment standards. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by subsection (i)(2)g below: 
                  a.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.). 
                  b.  No increment referred to in subsection (i)(2)g below shall exceed nine months. 
                  c.  Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the control authority including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with these increments of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the control authority. 
                  d.  Deadline for compliance with categorical standards. Compliance by existing sources with categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate subpart of 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N. Direct discharges with NPDES permits modified or reissued to provide a variance pursuant to Section 301(I)(2) of the Clean Water Act shall be required to meet compliance dates set in any applicable categorical pretreatment standard. Existing sources which become industrial users subsequent to promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be considered existing industrial users except where such sources meet the definition of a new source as defined in 40 CFR Part 403.3(k). New sources shall install and have in operating condition, and shall start-up all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
                  (4)  All sampling and testing performed under this subsection for reporting requirements shall be conducted in accordance with section 98-164. 
                  (5)  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the county within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the county within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. 
                  (6)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the county a report containing the information described in subsection (i)(2)d through f. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (m). 
                  (7)  Reports of changed conditions. Each nondomestic user must notify the county of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 60 days before the change. 
                  a.  The county may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection (b) above. 
                  b.  The county may issue a wastewater discharge permit under subsection (a)(4) above or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under subsection (c)(1) above in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
                  c.  For the purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 25 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
                  (j)  Confidential information. 
                  (1)  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs, and from the county's inspection and sampling activities shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the county, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. 
                  (2)  When requested by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall be made available for inspection by the public, upon receipt by the county of an open records request as provided by Georgia law with notification to the user by the county of the request and shall also be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
                  (k)  Maintenance of records. 
                  (1)  Sampling and testing records. Any permitted user subject to the reporting requirements established in subsection (i) shall maintain records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required by subsection (d). Such records shall include for all samples: 
                  a.  The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and names of the person or persons taking the samples; 
                  b.  The dates analyses were performed; 
                  c.  The name of the person(s) who performed the analysis;

                  (2)  Monitoring activities and records of results. Any permitted user subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall be required to retain for a minimum of three years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this chapter) and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the city, state or EPA. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the permitted user, or when requested by the county, state or EPA. 
                  (l)  Publication of names of permit violators. The county shall annually publish in the official organ of the county a list of the users who were significant violators during the 12 previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) and the user's response to such enforcement actions during the same 12 months. 
                  (m)  Application and reports signatories and certification. All wastewater discharge permit applications, questionnaires, and nondomestic user reports must be signed by an authorized representative, as define in subsection 98-72, and contain the following certification statement: 
                  "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.

                  Sec. 98-167. - Industrial pretreatment facilities. 
                  (a)  Requirements. All users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with the limitations and provisions contained in this article and to achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the county shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the county for review and shall be acceptable to the county prior to commencement of construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user of the responsibility for modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the county under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the county prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
                  (b)  Compliance schedules. The timing of construction and operation of pretreatment facilities as required hereby shall be in accordance with the compliance schedules provided by the county as described in subsection 98-163(a)(9); however, the county shall also have the authority to issue compliance schedules independent of the permitting process and such compliance schedules may be enforced by the county as provided in the enforcement and penalties section of this article. 
                  (c)  Maintenance of pretreatment facilities. All wastewater pretreatment facilities shall be properly and adequately maintained by the user so as to achieve the intended purpose of the facilities. 
                  (Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1, 3-27-2007) 
                  Sec. 98-168. - Sand and oil/grease interceptors. 
                  (a)  Generally. 
                  (1)  All commercial waste generators involved in the preparation of food for commercial purposes shall install and properly maintain oil/grease interceptors or traps to minimize the introduction of fats, oil and grease into the county's publically owned treatment works through proper operation and maintenance of grease interceptors. Additionally, any commercial waste generator who generates a wastewater which contains greater than the quantity of oil and grease regulated under section 98-161 shall install oil/grease interceptors or traps, provided that the excess oil and grease is floatable and can be effectively removed in an oil/grease interceptor or trap as determined by the director of the department. 
                  (2)  All commercial waste generators whose wastewater stream is associated with unusually large quantities of grit, sand or gravel shall be required to install a sand trap. All vehicle washing systems shall be required to install sand traps. 
                  (3)  For the purposes of this section, wastes of commercial origin are those generated by restaurants, institution kitchens, and other food service establishments, as well as car/truck wash facilities. All commercial waste generators involved in the preparation of food for commercial purposes shall provide an approved fat, oil, grease (FOG) pretreatment system such as a grease trap, provided that the excess FOG is floatable and can be effectively removed. All commercial facilities with vehicle washing will be required to provide a pretreatment system such as an oil separator and/or sand trap to remove oil waste prior to discharging to the sanitary sewer. 
                  (4)  The requirements of this section shall not apply to private living quarters or dwelling units. 
                  (b)  Design criteria. 
                  (1)  For restaurants and other food service establishments. All oil/grease interceptors or traps used in conjunction with restaurants or other eating establishments shall have a capacity of 15 gallons per seat, except that no grease trap shall be smaller than 750 gallons nor larger than 3,000 gallons; provided, however, that restaurants or other eating establishments located in existing buildings shall be required to have an oil/grease interceptor with a capacity determined by the director of the department of water resources or his designee. For purposes of this article, the term "food service establishment" shall mean any restaurant, eatery, food caterer, cafeteria, or other institution processing and serving food such as motels, hotels, prisons or schools. 
                  (2)  For facilities other than eating establishments. All sand and oil/grease interceptors or traps used in conjunction with facilities other than eating establishments shall have a capacity that will provide not less than ten minutes nor more than 30 minutes' retention time at the peak eight-hour flow rate. Flow through velocities shall not exceed one foot per second at the peak eight-hour flow rate. 
                  (3)  Size, location and construction. All sand and oil/grease interceptors shall be sized, located and constructed in accordance with the provisions of the duly adopted county plumbing code where such parameters have not been otherwise set forth in this article. 
                  (4)  Upgrade. If a food service establishment in existence prior to codification of this section does not have a grease trap or, as documented by inspection, it is determined that the current great trap is insufficient for the volume of food service waste being treated, the director may require that the establishment upgrade to an adequately sized oil/grease interceptor or trap. 
                  (c)  Maintenance. 
                  (1)  Pumping. To minimize the introduction of fats, oil and grease into the POTW, all grease, oil and sand interceptors or traps shall be maintained by the commercial waste generator to assure continually efficient operation at all times at the expense of the user. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the traps from which the waste was removed or any other grease trap for the purpose of reducing the volume to be hauled is strictly prohibited. Cleaning and maintenance of all grease, oil and sand interceptors or traps shall include removal of materials from the tank walls, baffles, cross pipes, inlets and outlets, both tee's and cover. 
                  (2)  Pumping frequency. 
                  a.  Outdoor sand and oil/grease interceptors or traps shall be pumped out or cleaned out completely once every 90 days or more frequently if determined by the director to ensure the combined fats, oil and grease, and solids accumulation does not exceed 25 percent of the liquid depth of the grease, oil and sand interceptors or traps. The 25 percent rule requires that the depth of oil and grease (floating and settled) in a trap shall not be equal or greater than 25 percent of the total operating depth of the trap. The operating depth of the trap is determined by measuring the internal depth of the tank. If the tank is measured with more than two feet of floating top solids or more than two feet of settled solids, the tank is in violation. 
                  b.  Indoor sand and oil/grease interceptors or traps shall be cleaned at intervals not less than once every 90 days, or more often as necessary to prevent pass-through of grease and other food solids into the POTW. Removal of fats, oil and grease waste and sediments is required when operational capacity is reduced to seventy-five percent or less. This is calculated by the volume of the top (grease) layer added to the volume of the bottom (sediment) layer, the sum of the layers are divided by the total operational volume - [(Top inches + Bottom inches) / total operational inches]. 
                  (3)  Pumping variance. Variances may be granted if the commercial waste generator can prove at their expense to the director's satisfaction that the discharge from the user's sand and oil/grease interceptor or trap is meeting the county's discharge limit up to 180 consecutive days for outdoor grease, oil and sand interceptors or traps or 120 consecutive days for indoor grease, oil and sand interceptors or traps. 
                  (d)  Proper disposal of collected materials. The discharge of the materials collected from grease traps and sand traps into the county wastewater system is prohibited. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by the owner's employees must be performed by waste disposal firms currently licensed by the county. All waste removed from grease traps must be disposed of at a facility permitted by the State of Georgia Environmental Protection Division to receive such waste. Under no circumstances shall the collected materials ever be returned to the wastewater or stormwater system. 
                  (e)  Additives. The use of any additive, such as enzymes, chemical or bacteria as a substitute for grease traps or grease trap maintenance is strictly prohibited. The use of additives as a supplement to grease trap or sewer maintenance may be authorized by the director after proper documentation and efficiency review. This authorization shall be obtained in writing from the director. 
                  (f)  Recordkeeping . 
                  (1)  Manifest. All commercial waste generators shall be responsible for maintaining manifests of waste removed. All materials collected from sand and oil/grease traps must be tracked by a manifest which confines pumping, hauling and disposal of waste. The manifest shall contain the following information: 
                  a.  Commercial Waste Generator information: 
                  1.  Name;

                  ROCKDALE WATER RESOURCES  2440 Tatum Road   CONYERS, GEORGIA 30013 
                  (4)  Penalties for Late Reports. A penalty, as set by the Board of Commissioners from time to time, may be assessed to any user for each day that a report required by this section is late beginning five business days after the date the report is due. Actions taken by the director to collect late reporting penalties shall not limit the director's authority to initiate other enforcement actions that may include penalties for late reporting violations. 
                  (g)  Inspection and entry. 
                  (1)  Authorized personnel of the county, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted at reasonable times to enter upon all properties without prior notification, for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, testing or record review, in accordance with this subsection. 
                  (2)  Inspection of a sand and oil/grease interceptor or trap shall be performed according to the "25 percent rule" as defined herein. 
                  (3)  If a sand and oil/grease interceptor or trap fails the initial inspection, the inspector may notify the commercial waste generator that the grease/oil interceptor or trap shall be cleaned out within seven calendar days. After seven calendar days, the sand and oil/grease interceptor or trap should be re-inspected. 
                  (4)  If at the first re-inspection, the sand and oil/grease trap is found to still be in non-compliance, a Notice of Violation may be issued and the commercial waste generator required to clean the grease/oil interceptor or trap immediately. The commercial waste generator may request an additional re-inspection again after three days. 
                  (5)  The commercial waste generator may be assessed a fee for additional inspections as set from time to time by the board of commissioners. 
                  (h)  Enforcement and penalty. 
                  (1)  When the director determines that a violation of this section exists, the director may issue to the commercial waste generator a written notice of violation and require the commercial waste generator to clean and inspect the sand and oil/grease interceptor immediately. Within ten calendar days of the receipt of such notice, the commercial waste generator shall submit to the director an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the commercial waste generator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. 
                  (2)  If the commercial waste generator fails to initiate or complete corrective action within the time frame specified within the Notice of Violation, the director may pursue one or more of the following options: 
                  a.  Issuance of a citation or file an appropriate action with the court to compel compliance. 
                  b.  Place the commercial waste generator on a probationary status and require monthly reporting of sand and oil/grease interceptor cleaning and inspection.

                  Sec. 98-169. - Accidental discharges; slug control plans. 
                  (a)  The county may require any industrial user to develop, submit for approval and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. In addition, at least once every two years, the county shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs such a plan. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
                  (1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
                  (2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
                  (3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the department of water resources of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b) or subsection 98-161(b), with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days; 
                  (4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
                  (b)  Oral notice to county. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the department of water resources of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions taken. 
                  (c)  Written notice to county. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the county a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the county wastewater facilities, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this division or other applicable law. 
                  (d)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of an accidental discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such an accidental discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
                  (Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1, 3-27-2007) 
                  Sec. 98-170. - High strength wastewater surcharge. 
                  (a)  Establishment. All users discharging high strength wastewater into the county wastewater system shall be assessed a monetary surcharge, in addition to the normally required wastewater use charges, in an amount to be calculated as shown in this section. A high strength wastewater is defined as wastewater which contains the following parameters in excess of the concentrations shown as follows: 
                  (1)  Five-day, 20 degrees Celsius biochemical oxygen demand of 225 milligrams per liter (mg/l); 
                  (2)  Total suspended solids of 225 mg/l; 
                  (3)  Total ammonia nitrogen (NH3+NH4) of 20 mg/l; 
                  (4)  Total inorganic phosphates of 10 mg/l; 
                  (5)  Floatable oil and grease of 100 mg/l. 
                  The parameters in this subsection shall be determined by the utilization of the sampling and testing procedures as provided in section 98-164. The amount of the surcharge, which is charged and assessed against all users discharging high strength wastewater into the county wastewater system, shall reflect the cost incurred by the county in handling the excess BOD, TSS, ammonia, total inorganic phosphates, and floatable oil and grease. 
                  This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the wastewater treatment facilities including depreciation and other incidental expenses. 
                  (b)  Formula. When the concentrations of the surcharged parameters exceed the values of the constituents as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the excess concentrations shall be subject to a surcharge in the amount derived in accordance with the following formula: 
                  P × (D) × 8.34 × C=$/month 
                  Where: 
                  "P" is equal to the concentration in mg/l of the parameter being evaluated (BOD, TSS, ammonia, total inorganic phosphates, or floatable oil and grease) which is in excess of the amounts shown in subsection (a) of this section. 
                  "D" is equal to the average daily wastewater discharge as determined by the county in subsection (d) of this section, or at the discretion of the county by variable periodic compliance reports as required in section 98-166. 
                  "8.34" is a conversion factor. 
                  "C" is equal to the unit cost in dollars per pound ($/lb) for the treatment of the surcharged parameters. This value shall be established by the department manager based on actual wastewater treatment costs which shall be revised from time to time as necessary. 
                  (c)  Quantitative measurement of surchargable parameters. The measurement of the surcharge parameters (BOD, TSS, ammonia, total inorganic phosphates, or floatable oil and grease) shall be conducted as follows: 
                  (1)  The county shall sample and test the user as provided in section 98-164 once per year, except that the duration of the sampling to determine surcharge shall be for a period to be determined by the director of the department of water resources. 
                  (2)  The county need not provide any prior notice to the industry with regard to the sampling period. 
                  (3)  The county may sample the user as often as desired at the county's expense if, in the opinion of the county representative, samples have not been previously obtained. 
                  (4)  If in the opinion of the user the samples taken by the county are not representative of the user's typical wastewater, then the user may request a resampling. At the user's request, the county shall grant the user not more than two resamplings per year. All user-requested resampling shall be done at the user's expense. A reasonable cost shall be charged to the user by the county therefor. 
                  (d)  Measurement of flow used in computing wastewater surcharges. The volume of flow used in computing wastewater surcharges shall be based upon the average daily flow rate as determined by county personnel using a properly maintained and calibrated flow meter during the sampling period outlined in subsection (c)(1) of this section. 
                  (e)  Billing procedure. Wastewater surcharges as provided for in this section shall be included on the user's regular water and wastewater bill or on a separate wastewater surcharge bill. 
                  (Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1, 3-27-2007; Ord. No. 2016-15, § 1, 10-11-2016) 
                  Sec. 98-171. - County's rights to monitor nondomestic users to confirm compliance. 
                  The county shall have the right and authority to enter upon any nondomestic user's premises for the purpose of observation, flow monitoring, wastewater sampling, or for any other reasonably necessary purpose to confirm the user's compliance with the provisions of this article. The county may, but is not required to, provide the user with prior notice of the entry.

                  Sec. 98-172. - Hazardous waste notification by nondomestic users. 
                  (a)  Any nondomestic user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the county the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CRF Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under the subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 98-166(j)(7). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections 98-166(i)(1), (2) and (3). 
                  (b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). A discharge of more than 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.30(e), requires a one-time notification. 
                  Subsequent months during which the nondomestic user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the nondomestic user must notify the county the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  (d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the nondomestic user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  (e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
