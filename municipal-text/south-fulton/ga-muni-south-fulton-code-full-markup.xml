         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a Publication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of South Fulton, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code include Ordinance No. 2017-001, adopted on April 29, 2017, and subsequent ordinances adopted by the City Council. The source of any new material since that date in each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  Title, Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. The title number occurs before the dash; the chapter number is the first digit of the number following the dash; and the section number is represented by the last number in the sequence. Thus, section 3-4006 is section 6, located in chapter 4 of title 3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and title, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-4006 and 3-4007 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-4006.5. New chapters and new articles may be included in the same way or, in the case of chapters, may be placed at the end of the title embracing the subject, and, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new chapter or article. New titles may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Index 
                  The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Paula Freeman, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Mark Massey, City Clerk, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  Section 6.

                  Sec. 7.16. - Transition. 
                  (a)  A period of time will be needed for an orderly transition of various government functions from Fulton County to the City of South Fulton. Accordingly, there shall be a transition period beginning on the date of the certification of the referendum results approving the incorporation of the City of South Fulton and ending at midnight on the last day of the twenty-fourth month following such date. During such transition period, all provisions of this Charter shall be effective as law, but not all provisions of this Charter shall be implemented. 
                  (b)  During such transition period, Fulton County shall continue to provide within the territorial limits of the City of South Fulton all government services and functions which Fulton County provided in that area during 2016 and at the same actual cost, except to the extent otherwise provided in this section; provided, however, that upon at least 30 days' prior written notice to Fulton County by the City of South Fulton, responsibility for any such service or function shall be transferred to the City of South Fulton. Beginning on May 1, 2017, the City of South Fulton shall collect taxes, fees, assessments, fines and forfeitures, and other moneys within the territorial limits of the City of South Fulton; provided, however, that upon at least 30 days' prior written notice to Fulton County by the City of South Fulton, the authority to collect any tax, fee, assessment, fine or forfeiture, or other moneys shall remain with Fulton County after May 1, 2017, until such time as Fulton County receives subsequent notice from the City of South Fulton that such authority shall be transferred to the City of South Fulton. 
                  (c)  During the transition period, the governing authority of the City of South Fulton: 
                  (1)  Shall hold regular meetings and may hold special meetings as provided in this Charter; 
                  (2)  May enact ordinances and resolutions as provided in this Charter; 
                  (3)  May amend this Charter by home rule action as provided by general law; 
                  (4)  May accept gifts and grants; 
                  (5)  May borrow money and incur indebtedness to the extent authorized by this Charter and general law; 
                  (6)  May levy and collect an ad valorem tax for calendar years 2018 and 2019; 
                  (7)  May establish a fiscal year and budget;

                  (9)  May generally exercise any power granted by this Charter or general law, except to the extent that a power is specifically and integrally related to the provision of a governmental service, function, or responsibility not yet provided or carried out by the city. 
                  (d)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, during the transition period, the Municipal Court of the City of South Fulton shall not exercise its jurisdiction. During the transition period, all ordinances of Fulton County shall remain applicable within the territorial limits of the City of South Fulton and the appropriate court or courts of Fulton County shall retain jurisdiction to enforce such ordinances. However, by appropriate agreement (and concurrent resolutions and ordinances if needed) Fulton County and the City of South Fulton may during the transition period transfer all or part of such regulatory authority and the appropriate court jurisdiction to the City of South Fulton. Any transfer of jurisdiction to the City of South Fulton during or at the end of the transition period shall not in and of itself abate any judicial proceeding pending in Fulton County or the pending prosecution of any violation of any ordinance of Fulton County. 
                  (e)  During the transition period, the governing authority of South Fulton may at any time, without the necessity of any agreement by Fulton County, commence to exercise its planning and zoning powers; provided, however, that the city shall give the county notice of the date on which the city will assume the exercise of such powers. Upon the governing authority of South Fulton commencing to exercise its planning and zoning powers, the Municipal Court of the City of South Fulton shall immediately have jurisdiction to enforce the planning and zoning ordinances of the city. The provisions of this subsection shall control over any conflicting provisions of any other subsection of this section. 
                  (f)  Effective upon the termination of the transition period, subsections (b) through (e) of this section shall cease to apply except for the last sentence of subsection (d) which shall remain effective. Effective upon the termination of the transition period, the City of South Fulton shall be a full functioning municipal corporation and subject to all general laws of this state. 
                  Sec. 7.17. - Directory nature of dates. 
                  It is the intention of the General Assembly that this Act be construed as directory rather than mandatory with respect to any date prescribed in this Act. If it is necessary to delay any action called for in this Act for providential cause or any other reason, it is the intention of the General Assembly that the action be delayed rather than abandoned. Any delay in performing any action under this Act, whether for cause or otherwise, shall not operate to frustrate the overall intent of this Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing it is specifically provided that: 
                  (1)  If it is not possible to hold the referendum election provided for in Section 7.14 of this Act on the date specified in that section, then such referendum shall be held as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable; and 
                  (2)  If it is not possible to hold the first municipal election provided for in Section 2.11 of this Act on the date specified in that section, then there shall be a special election for the initial members of the governing authority to be held as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, and the commencement of the initial terms of office shall be delayed accordingly. 
                  Sec. 7.18. - Charter commission. 
                  At the first regularly scheduled city council meeting, five years after the inception of the City of South Fulton, the mayor and city council shall call for a Charter commission to review the city's experience and recommend to the General Assembly any changes to the City Charter. Members of the Charter commission shall be appointed as follows: one by the mayor, one by the city council, and one by each member of the Georgia House of Representatives and Senate whose district lies wholly or partially within the corporate boundaries of the City of South Fulton. All members of the Charter commission must reside in the City of South Fulton. The commission must complete the recommendations within six months of its creation. 
                  Sec. 7.19. - Severability. 
                  In the event any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Act shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the other sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this Act, which shall remain of full force and effect, as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase so declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The General Assembly hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this Act if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional. 
                  Sec. 7.20. - General repealer. 
                  All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed. 
                  APPENDIX A. - CORPORATE LIMITS CITY OF SOUTH FULTON 
                  [(a)]  The City of South Fulton shall include all the territory embraced within the following census blocks based upon the 2010 United States decennial census but shall not include any territory that was annexed into another municipality before July 1, 2016, and shall not include the territory included within the Fulton County Industrial District unless the local constitutional amendment creating such district is repealed or determined judicially to be of no force and effect prior to the first municipal election for the city:

                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated in the Code); and 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of the ordinance sections inserted in the Code; but in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement of already embodied in the Code.

                  CHAPTER 3. - MAYOR AND COUNCIL 

                  Sec. 1-3001. - Time, place for meetings; open meetings. 
                  (a)  Unless otherwise noted by the council, all meetings of the council shall be held at: 7:00 p.m. In the event that there is no quorum present at the scheduled starting time for that meeting, the mayor shall wait 30 minutes to see whether a quorum will be present. If a quorum is not obtained after this waiting period, the mayor shall adjourn the meeting and readvertise it in accordance with state law. Meetings are held at 7:00 p.m. on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month unless special circumstances dictate a different meeting date, time, or place. In the event that special circumstances dictate a different meeting date, time, or place, the public shall be duly notified in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq., the Georgia Open Meetings Act. The council holds regularly scheduled work sessions commencing at 5:00 p.m. on the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month. 
                  (b)  All meetings of the council shall be held in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq., the Georgia Open Meetings Act. The public shall be granted access to all meetings at all times except closed executive sessions. The law states that where a quorum of the governing authority or agency thereof are present, and where official action is to be discussed or taken, the meetings must be open and the public granted access. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-003, § 1(2-2001), 4-29-2017; Ord. No. 2017-015, § 3, 8-22-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-3002. - Presiding officer and rules for debate. 
                  (a)  Generally. In accordance with the City Charter, the mayor shall preside over meetings of the council, and he or she serves as the presiding officer. In order to ensure a fair, orderly, and efficient meeting, the mayor must enforce the rules of procedure adopted by the council. In the absence of the mayor, the mayor pro tempore shall preside. Where a quorum is present and neither the mayor nor the mayor pro tempore is present, the council may designate an acting presiding officer. Meetings are conducted in accordance with these procedural rules, applicable state law, and Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised. Where a councilmember raises a procedural question and these rules are silent, and in the absence of a specific statute, ordinance, or resolution, the question shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised, so long as the provision used to answer the question is not in violation of local, state or federal laws. The parliamentarian shall advise the mayor on parliamentary inquiries for which such advice is sought. 
                  (b)  Debate. All resolutions, contracts, and items of business which require council approval prior to the expenditure of funds, as well as any other item which requires council action, shall be acted upon by the council only after a councilmember makes a motion and receives a second to the motion. A motion and proper second is recorded by the clerk. Each councilmember, by virtue of his/her election to the council, has the right and obligation to debate any and all issues which come before the council for consideration. However, to ensure an orderly and efficient meeting, each councilmember shall observe the following rules in regards to debate: 
                  (1)  The mayor, as presiding officer (or mayor pro tempore in the mayor's absence), shall call for discussion on an item. No debate on an item should begin until the item has been sounded by the clerk to the council (the clerk), or in the clerk's absence, the mayor's designee. 
                  (2)  Once the item has been properly moved and seconded, the mayor shall call for discussion. 
                  (3)  Thereafter, the mayor shall open debate by recognizing each councilmember who wishes to speak for a period not to exceed ten total minutes, with the additional stipulation that no councilmember shall hold the floor for more than five consecutive minutes of their allotted time. However, at the opening of each council meeting, a councilmember may ask their colleagues to waive the normal time limits on issues they deem need more time. The council will vote on each request before the agenda begins and decide among themselves what additional amount of time to allot to each councilmember. The clerk shall be the official timekeeper for the council. 
                  (4)  If a councilmember believes that debate on an issue is too lengthy or that a vote should be called for immediately on an issue, he or she can "call the question" or "move the previous question." This motion is out of order if it is made while another councilmember has the floor or if the maker of the motion is not recognized by the mayor. This is a motion that is not debatable and requires a second. Once the motion has been properly made and seconded, the mayor shall immediately stop debate on the issue being debated and announce that there is a call the question motion on the floor. Immediately thereafter, the mayor shall call for a vote on the call the question motion, not on the main motion. If the call the question motion fails, debate on the issue may continue, and then the mayor may allow debate on the issue to resume. If it passes, the mayor must immediately call for a vote on the issue which was the subject of the call the question motion. 
                  (5)  Any action by the council, including final action on applications for changes in land use status, but excluding a reconsideration of any action previously considered, i.e., motions to adjourn, motions to suspend the rules, an affirmative vote to lay on the table, or to take from the table, shall be subject to a motion to reconsider. After a motion to reconsider is made, a motion to rescind must also be made. After the motion to rescind is made, the matter would be appropriate for an additional passed motion and discussion thereon. Such motions can only be made by a member of the prevailing side on the original action. A motion to reconsider may be made immediately after it fails to prevail but in no case can it be made any later than the next scheduled council meeting. A motion to reconsider is debatable only if the action being reconsidered is debatable. Upon passage of a motion to reconsider, the subject matter shall be considered anew without regard to previous council action. No reconsideration can be made on a zoning request at a subsequent meeting. 
                  (6)  Any zoning matter which is deferred or on which discussion is otherwise postponed by the council shall be heard at the next appropriate scheduled zoning meeting. Zoning matters are heard only on the first meeting of the month, in accordance with a schedule set by the director of developmental services. Ordinarily, no new zoning cases are heard in January. 
                  (c)  Quorum. A quorum must be present for the transaction of business of the council. In accordance with the Georgia law, four of the seven elected councilmembers must be present to constitute a quorum. It is the duty of the mayor to enforce this rule. Any councilmember may raise a point of order if that councilmember believes that a quorum is not present. If during the course of a meeting a quorum is lost, the council cannot transact business. If, however, members of the council are in the councilmembers' conference room adjacent to the assembly hall and are able to hear the business of the council through the public address system, the council has not lost a quorum. If a quorum is not attained within 30 minutes, the mayor must adjourn the meeting. 
                  (d)  Duties and privileges of the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall preserve order and decorum, and shall immediately speak to points of order and shall decide all questions of order, subject to appeal. In case of any disturbance or disorderly conduct, the presiding officer shall have the power to require the chamber to be cleared or request that the sergeant at arms (chief of police and or the designee) remove those individuals ruled by the chair as being out of order. In the event the chair fails to rule individuals out of order that are causing a disturbance, any member of council may call for a point of order and present a motion to have the individual ruled out of order and to instruct the sergeant of arms to remove those individuals ruled as out of order. The motion to remove will require a two-thirds vote. The presiding officer shall require the observation of rules of conduct to protect the rights of all councilmembers and citizens. 
                  (e)  Order of business. When a quorum is present the council shall proceed to the business before it, which shall be conducted, as much as practicable, in the following order: 
                  (1)  Meeting called to order. 
                  (2)  Quorum roll call. 
                  (3)  Invocation. 
                  (4)  Pledge to the Flag. 
                  (5)  Presentation/announcements. 
                  (6)  Committee reports. 
                  (7)  Approval of the council agenda. 
                  (8)  Approval of city council minutes. 
                  (9)  Public hearings. 
                  (10)  Public comments. 
                  (11)  Consent agenda items. Any councilmember may move an item from the consent agenda to the council agenda. 
                  (12)  Agenda items. Only a councilmember who places an item on the council agenda may remove the item. 
                  (13)  Comments from council. 
                  (13)  Recess to executive session. 
                  (14)  Adjournment. 
                  The chair, without debate, subject to appeal, shall decide all questions relating to the priority of business. The agenda for the meeting may be amended upon two-thirds vote of the council. 
                  (f)  Voting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the councilmembers present shall be required for the adoption of any ordinance, resolution, or motion. Each councilmember shall record his or her vote in the manner called for by the mayor. 
                  (g)  Agenda, preparation of; public comment. 
                  (1)  The council holds regular meetings on the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month. Work sessions of the council are held on the same days. Regular meetings commence at 7:00 p.m., and work sessions commence at 5:00 p.m. All times are Eastern Standard Time. The agenda is prepared at the direction of the mayor and by the clerk's office in concert with the city manager's office. The deadline for submitting items for regularly scheduled council meetings to the clerk's office for inclusion on the next agenda is 10:00 a.m. on Friday prior to the meeting. A final copy of the agenda is distributed to the councilmembers, city attorney, city manager and appropriate staff by 2:00 p.m. on the Friday preceding the scheduled meeting of the council. Copies are also made available to the public at that time. A post agenda is provided after the meeting. The post agenda is a precursor to the final minutes and reflects actions taken by the council at a particular meeting. Post agendas/preliminary minutes are distributed by the clerk's office within 48 hours of a meeting. 
                  (2)  The agenda preparation procedure is as follows: 
                  a.  Any councilmember wishing to place an item on the agenda may do so and should submit a memorandum to the clerk stating the item to be placed on the agenda. Any supporting documents germane to the item should also be submitted. 
                  b.  Adding of items to the agenda during the meeting is disfavored. Where there is a showing of an emergency or extraordinary circumstances exist, an item may be added to the agenda when it is adopted during the meeting by four affirmative votes. A motion shall be properly made and must carry to add each item to the agenda on the day of the meeting. That item shall appear on the post agenda under the "added during the meeting" heading. 
                  c.  Under the public comment section of the agenda, members of the public may be placed on the agenda to discuss a particular item of importance. To do so, the member of the public should first contact the office of the county manager who will ensure that the relevant department heads and other individuals have been contacted in an attempt to resolve the issue. In the event that the issue cannot be resolved by the county manager in consultation with the department heads, the citizen may then contact any councilmember so that councilmember may place that person on the agenda. The councilmember should then inform the clerk by memorandum stating the subject to be discussed, the person who will discuss it, a contact address, and a phone number for the person who will discuss the matter. Any supporting material germane to the item being discussed should also be submitted. 
                  d.  Whenever any agenda item, via resolution, seeks council approval of a written agreement, a copy of the written agreement shall be attached to the agenda item or resolution and shall be distributed by the clerk as with other agenda items. Upon approval of the item, the clerk shall include a copy of the written agreement in the official minutes of the council meeting at which such approval occurred. 
                  (h)  Consent agenda. The council uses a consent agenda which lists items of routine nature, such as renewal of grants, subdivision confirmations, refund reports, etc. Any items of business that are expected to receive unanimous approval and for which debate is not expected, should be placed on the consent agenda. Items may be removed from the consent agenda for further discussion, but may not be added. The consent agenda is adopted with one motion. 
                  (i)  Decorum. All councilmembers are expected to conduct themselves in a courteous and respectful manner. Councilmembers seeking information from staff should do so within the confines of proper decorum. A councilmember shall not speak until recognized by the mayor and likewise shall not interrupt another councilmember's remarks. All comments made by a councilmember shall directly address the motion or item being discussed. The mayor shall enforce the rules of decorum and if a councilmember believes that a particular rule is being broken he/she shall raise a point of order when recognized by the mayor. A second on a point or order issue is not required, and the mayor may either rule on the question or allow the council to decide the issue by majority vote. Any councilmember shall have the right to express dissent from or protest against any resolution or action of the council and have the reason entered into the minutes. 
                  (j)  Public hearings and participation. 
                  (1)  In accordance with law and policy, the council frequently conducts public hearings on a number of matters and issues. These public hearing rules are intended to ensure that the public has the opportunity to fairly participate in the meeting while promoting the orderly, efficient, and effective flow of the meeting. 
                  (2)  Rules for conducting public hearings and allowing for public comment are as follows: 
                  a.  Agenda. 
                  1.  Public comment shall be at or near the start of the council meeting. 
                  2.  If a public hearing is required, or if it is requested by the council, the mayor shall announce that the public hearing on a matter is now open and should call forth those persons who wish to speak in favor, against, or otherwise on the particular issue. The mayor shall inform the public that all comments by proponents, opponents, or the public shall be made from the podium and that any individual making a comment should first give their name and address. The mayor shall also inform the public that comments will only be received from the podium. 
                  b.  Members of the public who wish to speak should complete a speaker's card and should hand it to a representative of the clerk's office. Members of the public are expected to adhere to the rules of decorum outlined herein and should be informed of such at the beginning of the public hearing by the mayor. There should be no vocal, boisterous, or other disruptive demonstrations which will disrupt the orderly flow of the meeting. Any persons engaging in this type of behavior shall be ruled out of order by the mayor and shall, at the mayor's discretion, be removed from the assembly hall. 
                  (3)  Time. 
                  a.  At all meetings other than those addressed in subsection (j)(3)b of this section, the time for public comment shall be limited to 30 minutes, and each speaker will have two minutes to address the council. Time provided to one speaker may not be transferred to another. The council may allow for more time, either in total or per speaker, by a majority vote. 
                  b.  At hearings on proposed rezonings, use permit, modification and/or concurrent variance petitions, as well as amendments to the text of the Fulton County Zoning Resolution (hereinafter "land-use petitions"), proponents and opponents are allowed ten minutes per side to present data, evidence and opinions. Each side's time period may be divided among multiple speakers in whatever manner desired. In the event a public hearing is conducted and final action on a land-use petition is deferred by the council, a second public hearing (conducted under the same rules as set forth above) will be allowed when the petition is again considered by the council following the deferral. No land-use petition shall be the subject of more than two public hearings before the council, regardless of the number of times final action is deferred by the council, unless four or more members of the council vote to conduct such additional public hearing(s). 
                  (4)  Once the public hearing has concluded, the mayor shall so announce, and the council shall convene into open executive session to make its decisions. 
                  (5)  As a general rule, members of the public do not speak on agenda items unless those items have been advertised for public hearing, have been placed in the public hearing segment of the agenda or unless the council, by four affirmative votes, has decided that public participation is necessary in its deliberative process. The council shall follow its public hearing rules when such participation is warranted. 
                  (6)  Persons claiming to represent a homeowners association must sign an affidavit stating that the homeowners association for which they claim to speak has authorized them to do so. The clerk shall maintain copies of such affidavits and bring them to the council meetings. 
                  (k)  Amendments. Any amendment to this division by a councilmember shall be submitted to the clerk in writing one week before the designated meeting. The proposed amendment shall be included on the agenda for that meeting and distributed to all councilmembers. All amendments require four affirmative votes by the council for adoption. 
                  (l)  Special meetings and rescheduled regular meetings. Whenever the mayor cancels, reschedules, or moves the regularly scheduled meeting, it must be done in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq., the Georgia Open Meetings Act which requires that notice of the change is posted for at least 24 hours at the place of the regular meeting. In addition, written or oral notice shall be given by the clerk at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting to either the legal organ of the county or a newspaper having a general circulation at least equal to that of the legal organ and to each member of the council. Other special meetings known as special call meetings may be scheduled by the mayor at the request of four councilmembers. Special call meetings are also governed by the notice requirements set forth above. When emergency circumstances occur, the council may hold a meeting with less than 24 hours' notice. When such meetings are held, the clerk shall provide notice to the legal organ of the county, or a newspaper with at least the general circulation of the legal organ, and to each member of the council as soon as practical. The notice shall include those subjects expected to be discussed at the meeting. In addition, the minutes shall reflect the reason for the emergency meeting and the nature of the notice. 
                  (m)  Executive sessions. Executive sessions of the council may be held for the purpose of conducting business excepted by O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq., the Georgia Open Meetings Act. Where a meeting is devoted in part to matters within the authorized exceptions to the Georgia Open Meetings Act, any portion of the meeting not subject to any such exception shall be open to the public. No executive session shall be held except pursuant to a majority affirmative vote of the council taken in a public meeting. The minutes of the public meeting shall reflect the names of the councilmembers present, those voting for the executive session, and the reasons for the session. Only necessary staff shall be present at the executive session 
                  (n)  Suspending the rules of order. Rules of order may be suspended where a motion to suspend is properly moved and seconded. The term "rules of order" in this context means suspending the order of business, moving an item up or down on the agenda, or removing an item from the agenda. Four affirmative votes shall be required to suspend the rules of order. Rules governing a quorum, voting methods and requirements, the notification to councilmembers of meetings, and rules necessary for compliance with state and/or federal law may not be suspended. 
                  (o)  Parliamentarian. The council shall designate a person as its parliamentarian. The parliamentarian shall serve as the parliamentarian for the council, and in that capacity will answer point of order questions when directed by the mayor. 
                  (p)  Establishment and appointment of committees, commissions, city authorities, boards, and taskforces. 
                  (1)  The creation of any committee composed exclusively of councilmembers, commission, or any city authority, or board by the mayor or council shall require approval by a majority vote of the council, except those exempted by state law. 
                  (2)  Appointment of members to such committees composed exclusively of councilmembers, commissions, city authorities, or boards will be made by the mayor and confirmed by majority vote of the council, except those exempted by state law, or unless the creating ordinance specifies another method of appointment. All appointments to standing committees, commissions, city authorities, or boards shall be made and approved within 30 days of a vacancy. 
                  (3)  The mayor or council may create task forces to analyze and recommend solutions to specific issues, opportunities, or problems. Task forces may be created by resolution or by ordinance, and the number of members, qualifications, and term shall be provided in the resolution or ordinance. The method of appointment shall be as described in subsection (p)(2) of this section. Task forces shall have no quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative functions, and shall not be delegated the power of subpoena. 
                  (q)  Attorney-client privilege. Should attorney-client privileged material be disclosed to the city council in a closed meeting with the city attorney or other counsel engaged to represent the city, or in written legal opinions drafted by the city attorney or outside counsel, the privilege shall belong to the City of South Fulton. Therefore, the decision to waive that attorney-client privilege by disclosing either orally or in writing the contents of the attorney-client privileged material may only be made by majority vote of the council and not by an individual member of the city council. 
                  (r)  Request for legal opinion. Requests by one or more councilmembers for a formal written legal opinion shall require approval by a majority vote of the full council. 
                  (s)  Hiring of department heads. At least ten business days prior to the council vote to fill a vacant department head position, the city manager shall provide the mayor and council with the resumes of the top three candidates. 
                  (t)  Representation of private interests. In keeping with their role as stewards of the public interest, councilmembers shall not appear on behalf of the private interests of third parties before the council or any board or commission, or proceeding of the city, nor shall members of boards and commissions appear before their own bodies or before the council on behalf of the private interests of third parties on matters related to the areas of service of their bodies. 
                  (u)  Advocacy. Councilmembers shall represent the official policies or positions of the city council, board and commission to the best of their ability when designated as delegates for this purpose. When presenting their individual opinions and positions, whether publicly or privately, councilmembers shall explicitly state they do not represent the governing body or the city, nor will they allow the inference that they do. 
                  (v)  Independence of boards and commissions. Because of the value of the independent advice of boards and commissions to the public decision-making process, members of council shall refrain from using their position to unduly influence the deliberations or outcomes of board and commission proceedings. 
                  (w)  Positive work place environment. Councilmembers shall support the maintenance of a positive and constructive work place environment for city employees and for citizens and businesses dealing with the city. councilmembers shall recognize their role in interactions with city employees as delineated in Charter section 3.28 and refrain from creating the inference of inappropriate direction to staff. 
                  (x)  Implementation of the Code of Ethics. As an expression of the standards of conduct for members expected by the city the code of ethics, as codified in sections 1-5001 through 1-5030, is intended to be self-enforcing. In order to be effective, councilmembers must be thoroughly familiar with it and embrace its provisions. For this reason, ethical standards shall be included in the regular orientations for city councilmembers, appointees to boards and commissions, and newly appointed officials. Councilmembers entering office shall sign a statement affirming they have read and understood the city code of ethics.

                  This chapter shall be known as the "City of South Fulton Open Records Ordinance."

                  Sec. 1-7002. - Records officer. 
                  There is hereby created the appointment of the city's open records officer. The open records officer may designate, in writing, assistant open records officer(s) as required to perform the duties of his or her office. Before undertaking the duties of the office, the open records officer and assistant open records officers shall take an oath, in writing, to diligently perform such duties. The open records officer shall serve at the pleasure of city manager. The open records officer may be an existing employee of the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-025, § 1(1-7001), 10-10-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-7003. - Duties and procedures. 
                  (a)  It shall be the duty of the open records officer and his or her duly designated assistant open records officer(s) to accept written requests to inspect and copy public records, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq., and to produce to the requester all records responsive to a request within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed three business days of receipt of a request, unless the time for response is extended in accordance with law. 
                  (b)  No written request shall be deemed filed until served upon the open records officer, by hand delivery to the officer at the City of South Fulton, by certified United States mail return receipt requested, by statutory overnight delivery, or by email to openrecords@cityofsouthfultonga.gov. 
                  (c)  Written requests served upon any other officer or employee of the city shall not be deemed filed, until the requester has filed his or her request, in writing, with the open records officer. 
                  (d)  In the absence or unavailability of the open records officer, an assistant open records officer shall perform the duties of the open records officer. 
                  (e)  The absence or unavailability of a designated open records officer shall not delay the city's response to a properly served request 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-025, § 1(1-7001), 10-10-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-7004. - Request response. 
                  (a)  Upon receipt of a request, it shall be the duty of the open records officer to promptly ascertain the availability of all public records responsive to the request and to produce to the requester those records that can be located and produced within a reasonable time, not to exceed three business days of receipt of a request. For purposes of computing the time within which a response must be made, the open records officer shall not count the business day on which a request is received, nor any intervening Saturday, Sunday, or designated holiday on which city offices are closed for general business. Upon intake of a request, the open records officer shall stamp the request with the date and time of receipt, and initial the request. In any instance where records are unavailable within three business days of the request, it shall be the duty of the open records officer to provide the requester with a written description of such records and a timeline for when the records will be available for inspection or copying and to provide the responsive records to the requester as soon thereafter as practicable. Such response shall also contain a good faith estimate of the cost to the requester for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production and copying of records. 
                  (b)  It is the intent of the city council that the open records officer be accessible within City Hall during the normal hours of general operation of the city's administrative staff, i.e., 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, except on recognized holidays and those days when City Hall is closed. The open records officer shall coordinate his or her work schedule with the assistant open records officers to ensure coverage within City Hall during normal hours at all times when the open records officer is scheduled to be absent or unavailable for extended periods of time. Backup procedures will be implemented by the city manager to ensure such coverage by assistant open records officers during the open records officer's unplanned absence or unavailability. 
                  (c)  By law, notice of the designation of open records officers shall be posted on the official bulletin board at City Hall, in the legal organ of city, and on the city's website. In addition, city officers, department directors, and administrative staff will be instructed on how to assist and direct persons desiring to request inspection and copying of public records. 
                  (d)  To further assist persons desiring to inspect records, a request form will be available at City Hall and on the city's website. The open records officer shall confer with every officer or department manager of the city, as necessary, to ascertain the existence of public records responsive to a request (including electronically-stored information), and it shall be the duty of every city officer and department manager to confer with and provide records, or true and correct copies of the originals thereof, to the open records officer promptly, time being of the essence. Upon receipt of a public record responsive to a request, the open records officer shall determine, in consultation with the city attorney, if the record is exempt from disclosure by order of a court of this state or by law; if the record is exempt from disclosure, the written response by the open records officer shall set forth the specific legal authority under which withholding of inspection of the record is claimed. The open records officer shall maintain a log or other documentation of his or her due diligence to comply with a proper request.

                  Sec. 1-7005. - Fees. 
                  (a)  The open records officer shall further have the duty to collect from a requester a reasonable charge for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of records, utilizing the most economical means available to identify and produce non-excluded records. The charge for the search, retrieval, or redaction of records shall not exceed the prorated hourly salary of the lowest paid full-time employee who, in the reasonable discretion of the open records officer, has the necessary skill and training to perform the request; provided, however, no charge shall be made for the first quarter hour. In addition thereto, where certified copies of specific records are sought, the fees for certified copies prescribed by law shall apply; otherwise, a fee for the copying of records shall not exceed $0.10 per page for letter or legal size documents or, in the case of other documents and electronic records, the actual cost of reproducing the document or media on which the records or media are produced. 
                  (b)  It shall be the right of the requester, at the time of inspection, to make photographic copies or other electronic reproductions of records, at his or her own expense, using suitable portable devices brought to the place of inspection. Whenever any person has requested to inspect and copy public records and received a written response estimating the cost of the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of responsive records, and the city has actually incurred such costs but the requester fails to inspect or accept copies of the records, the open records officer shall be authorized to collect such charges in any manner authorized by law.

                  Sec. 1-8001. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this statement of financial policy of the city is to serve as a foundation for long- and short-term range planning, facilitate decision making, and provide direction to the city council and operational staff for handling the city's day-to-day financial business. Because of the diverse nature of the city's departments and committees, having written defined financial policies minimizes the risk of developing conflicting or inconsistent goals and objectives which could have a negative impact on the overall financial condition of the city.

                  Nonspendable means financial resources that will never convert to cash, that will not convert to cash soon enough to affect the current period, or that must be maintained intact pursuant to legal or contractual requirements. 
                  Restricted means financial resources that are subject to externally enforceable legal restrictions such as debt covenants, federal or state grant requirements, private donors/contributors, or other governmental entities. 
                  Unassigned means any residual net resources available after consideration of designation of nonspendable, restricted, committed or assigned fund balance.

                  (1)  If the general fund's unassigned fund balance falls below the minimum targeted level as defined in this policy, the city council shall approve and adopt a plan to restore the general fund's unassigned fund balance to its target level within a 24-month period.

                  (3)  The city council shall avoid the appropriation of general fund's unassigned fund balance for recurring operating or capital expenditures unless there is some extraordinary, non-recurring event which would require the appropriation in order to meet the needs of the citizenry or an emergency.

                  1.  The appropriate back up for the purchase is attached to the requisition. 
                  2.  The correct purchase/object allocations are used based on the approved budget. 
                  3.  An e-verify affidavit form is attached where required.

                  (j)  Purchasing thresholds . 
                  (1)  For goods, services, and professional services $2,501.00 and below, upon approval by the purchasing manager, the user department shall obtain goods and services most advantageous to the city through direct purchase through the use of a requisition or p-card. 
                  (2)  For goods and services between $2,501.00 and $25,000.00, the user department shall obtain, where possible, at least three written quotes, subject to approval by the city manager. 
                  (3)  For professional services between $2,501.00 and $25,000.00, a quality based selection process will be used, subject to approval of the award by the city manager. The department head shall justify the choice in writing to be attached to the requisition. 
                  (4)  For goods and services $25,001.00 and above, the purchasing department will use a formal procurement process. The purchasing manager shall issue the solicitation and make a recommendation to city council for approval. 
                  (5)  For professional services $25,001.00 and above, a quality based selection process will be used. The purchasing department will use a formal procurement process. The purchasing manager shall issue the solicitation and make a recommendation to city council for approval. 

                   

                   
                  (k)  Non-competitive procurements . The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the procurement of goods and services, when determined to be in the best interest of the city and not in conflict with the requirements of state law. 
                  (1)  Sole source/single source procurement . The city may acquire goods, services, or professional services pursuant to a sole source/single source procurement. Sole source/single source procurement is allowable when goods, services, or professional services are limited to one source, or when they must be obtained from a specific manufacturers' dealer and valid competition among dealers does not exist. A sole source/single source procurement may also be made from one person among others in a competitive market place, which, for justifiable reasons, is found to be most advantageous for the purpose of fulfilling the given purchasing need. 
                  (2)  Sole brand procurement . The purchasing agent may elect to purchase particular brand name goods or services when the goods or services comprise a major brand system, program or service previously selected by the city for standardization due to operational effectiveness, future enhancements or additions, or maintenance or storage of spare parts precludes the mixing of brands, manufacture, etc. The user must submit the justification for the sole source/single source procurement for approval to the purchasing agent. 
                  (3)  Direct negotiation following competitive solicitation . Following the completion of a competitive award solicitation process that fails to produce a responsible or responsive bidder or proposer, fails to produce a qualified respondent, or for which all submissions were rejected for any reason, the city may procure the goods, services, or professional services that were the subject of such failed solicitation by direct negotiation with any provider of such failed solicitation. Direct negotiations shall be facilitated by the purchasing manager, with assistance as necessary by the city manager and city attorney. A proposed contract shall be submitted to the city council for consideration. The council may reject, approve or direct further negotiations of the contract. Direct negotiations under this paragraph shall commence within 90 days of the completion of the failed competitive solicitation process. 
                  (4)  Emergency procurement . The city and city manager may acquire goods, services or professional services under the defined thresholds by direct negotiation, in lieu of the formal solicitation processes set forth under this chapter, in situations of an emergency. Emergency situations exist where there is an imminent threat to: a) public health, safety or welfare, b) the soundness and integrity of public services or property, or c) the delivery of essential city services. Emergency procurements shall be made with as much competition as is reasonable or practicable under the circumstances, which may consist of acquisition of goods and services under the direct negotiation process outlined in the paragraph above. As soon as practicable, a record of each emergency procurement shall be made and shall set forth the contractor's name, the amount and type of the contract, a listing of the item procured under the contract, the basis for the emergency situation and the identification number of the contract file. 
                  Emergency procurements associated with projects utilizing grant funds will always follow the established procurement procedures of the grant. 
                  (5)  Costs under the competitive threshold . The user department may acquire goods, services and professional services by direct negotiation or by some other non-competitive method, when the dollar value of the purchase does not exceed $2,501.00 and a properly executed and authorized requisition is received. Under this non-competitive method, the user department shall attempt to obtain the goods, services or professional services most advantageous to the city, price and other factors considered. 
                  (6)  Direct negotiation and other public entities and co-ops . The city may acquire goods, services, and professional services by direct negotiation or other method involving limited or no competition from a supplier having a requirements contract/annual agreement with any public entity (e.g., federal, state, county, city, authority, school board, buying cooperative, etc.) for goods, services, or professional services described in such contract and at prices or discounts no less favorable than any set forth in such contracts. Use of state/co-op contracts: the purchasing agent may, independent of the requirements of bid process of this article, procure supplies, services or construction items through a contract established through competitive means by the purchasing department of the State of Georgia, national co-ops (i.e. U.S. communities), and collaborative purchasing agreements with other local governments when deemed to be in the best interest of the city. 
                  Nothing in this chapter shall impact and/or limit the city's ability to pursue purchasing cooperatives and alternatives allowable under state law through the Georgia Municipal Association and other organizations. 
                  (l)  Competitive procurements . The purchasing department will determine the procurement method to be used based on the type and estimated price of the purchase. The city reserves the right to reject any or all bids if it determines such rejection to be in the best interest of the city. Formal solicitations will generally be solicited on a project-by-project basis. The user will submit the scope of goods and/or services to the purchasing manager, who will then determine which of the competitive processes best suits the purchase. A performance guarantee, such as a performance bond or letter of credit, may be required for any solicitation that includes services to be performed after consultation with the city manager, and others, as necessary. Periodically, the city may be given private/public grants and donations from sources such as the state and federal government and private corporations. These types of solicitations may be more restrictive and may dictate the procurement process and methodology that the city is to follow for an award. Both federal and state procurement policy supersedes City of South Fulton's purchasing requirements when buying goods and services using federal or state grant monies. Departments should consult the accounting department regarding the use of federal and state funds. 
                  (1)  Invitation to bids. Invitation to bids (ITB) are prepared and issued to prospective bidders, with the goal of obtaining competitive responses for items costing $25,001.00 and greater. 
                  a.  Public notice (such as publication in a newspaper of general circulation, posting on the purchasing department's internet web page, posting on state internet web page, or third party eSourcing platform) of the ITB must be given a minimum of 14 calendar days prior to the date set for bid opening or as required by state and federal law, unless it can be demonstrated that an urgent requirement for goods or services exists, in which instance, the requirement for public notice may be reduced by the purchasing manager. 
                  b.  Bids shall be opened publicly by the purchasing manager, or their designee, in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the ITB. All relevant information, including each bid amount and bidder's name, will be recorded on a summary sheet and signed by the opener and witness. 
                  c.  The purchasing manager shall evaluate the bids and make a recommendation to the city council. A split or partial bid may be awarded if an ITB is for multiple goods or services, more than one vendor provides a bid that meets the specifications for the items, and a price comparison can be made between the items quoted. The award may be split between more than one vendor by awarding to the lowest cost provider of each item or reasonable grouping of items if acquisition, delivery, and other requirements can be reasonably administered. A split or partial bid award shall not be used under the following conditions: 
                  1.  When the solicitation is for an integrated system and the split of the award between components or parts of that system would jeopardize performance; or 
                  2.  If the item is part of a system and the performance of that system would be jeopardized if another brand was substituted. 
                  d.  Tie bids: In the event two or more identical bids are received, the following procedure will be used when the basis of award is low bid: 
                  1.  To the extent permitted by law, a tie bidder with a registered business location within the city will be recommended to the city council for an award over one without an office in the city, a registered business within the county limits of Fulton County should be recommended to the city council for an award over one without an office in the county, and a registered business within the State of Georgia will be recommended to the city council for an award over one without an office in Georgia. 
                  2.  If the procedures in the paragraph above do not result in an award, then, the tie bidders will be contacted and advised of the tie bid. Bidders will be given the opportunity to provide a best and final offer in writing submitted in a sealed envelope to be opened at the time and place stated by city staff. If one or more of the tied bidders agrees to participate, award will be made to the new low bid. If none of the tied bidders agree to participate or if the new bids are tied, then city staff shall break the tie by following the procedures described below, as necessary. 
                  3.  If the procedures in (i) and (ii) do not result in an award, then, to the extent permitted by law, a tie bidder deemed in the city's sole discretion to provide the most environmentally preferable goods would be recommended to the appropriate approving authority for an award over one deemed environmentally inferior. 
                  4.  In the event the above does not result in an award, the city reserves the right to award to both tie vendors when it is feasible and in the best interest of the city to do so. 
                  5.  Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids is permitted in accordance to the terms indicated within the ITB; however, minor irregularities may be waived by the city. No bid may be withdrawn for a period of 120 days after the time scheduled for bid opening or as permissible by state law. 
                  e.  Any bid received after the time and date set for receipt of bids is late. Any withdrawal or modification of a bid received after the time and date set for opening of bids, at the place designated for opening, is considered late. Late bids will be rejected and remain unopened. 
                  f.  Bids will be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth in the ITB, which may include criteria to determine acceptability of goods (for example, inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose). Criteria for the acceptability of goods shall be used to determine whether particular goods are responsive to the invitation to bids, and not to determine the relative desirability between acceptable goods. 
                  g.  The city reserves the right to waive any informalities or irregularities of bids, to request clarification of information submitted in any bid, to further negotiate with the responsive and responsible bidder selected for contract award, or to reject any or all bids for any reason whatsoever. 
                  h.  If no responsive and responsible bids are received or all bids are rejected, the city may procure such goods and services by direct negotiation. 
                  i.  The bid will be awarded, if an award is made, to the responsible and responsive bidder offering the lowest price whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the ITB. The bid may require a contract. 
                  (2)  Request for informal quotes (RFIQ). Request for informal quotes are prepared and issued to prospective bidders by the user department, with the goal of obtaining competitive responses for items costing between $2,501.00 and $50,000.00. The RFIQ shall define the scope of the work and may contain contractual terms and conditions. In most cases, the bid award will be made on best price, but the award may be made on other grounds which are determined to be in the best interest of the city. The RFIQ may require the submission of bid samples, descriptive literature, and technical data and may require inspection or testing of a product before a final award. The user department shall summarize quotes on a summary sheet for use in consideration of an award. 
                  (3)  Request for proposals (RFP). When the purchasing manager determines the use of an ITB is not practical or not advantageous because of existing market conditions or the type of items required, the city may procure goods, services, or professional services through receipt of competitive sealed proposals. Competitive sealed proposals are solicited using an RFP, with the goal of obtaining competitive responses for items costing more than $25,001.00. 
                  a.  Public notice of the RFP shall be given in the same manner as for ITB procurements. 
                  b.  Proposals shall be opened publicly by the purchasing manager, or their designee, in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the RFP. A register of proposals shall be prepared that lists each proposer's name, which will be signed by the opener and the witness. 
                  c.  Correction or withdrawal of proposals is permitted in accordance with any instructions allowing the same contained within the RFP. 
                  d.  Proposals shall be deemed late in the same manner as the procurement process for an ITB. 
                  e.  The RFP will identify the criteria to be considered and evaluated as the basis of award. 
                  f.  Proposals submitted by responsible and responsive proposers shall be evaluated in writing by the purchasing agents and purchasing manager based upon the criteria applicable to the RFP. All proposals will be ranked by such evaluators in order of their acceptability, giving consideration to the criteria. The city has no obligation to award the contract to the proposer who proposes the lowest price. The evaluations shall be provided to the city council for selection of the final award. The contract will be awarded, if award is made, by the city to the responsive and responsible proposer whose proposal is determined, in the city's exclusive discretion, to be the most advantageous to the city, taking into consideration price, qualifications, and other factors as indicated in the RFP. 
                  g.  The city reserves the right to waive any informalities or irregularities of proposals, to request clarification of information submitted in any proposal, to further negotiate with a responsive and responsible proposer who has been selected for contract award, or to reject any or all proposals for any reason whatsoever. 
                  h.  If no responsive and responsible proposals are received or all proposals are rejected, the city may procure such goods, services, and professional services by direct negotiation. 
                  (m)  Quality based selections (QBS). 
                  (1)  Request for qualifications (RFQ). Requests for qualifications (RFQ) may be used when it is determined to be in the city's best interest to evaluate the experience and qualifications of a service provider, without regard to price or prior to considering price. 
                  a.  The procedure for soliciting, opening and evaluating statements of qualifications shall be the same as described herein for competitive sealed proposals. Service providers whose qualifications meet the criteria established in the RFQ, at the sole discretion of the city, may be considered for contract award by participation in the completion of price negotiation. The city shall attempt to negotiate a fee with the highest ranked firm. If no agreement is reached, the city shall begin negotiations with the next highest ranked firm. Negotiations will proceed in this manner until an agreement is reached. Alternatively, the city may, by direct negotiation, finalize terms with service providers who are selected for award based on qualifications. The city reserves the right to reject any or all responses for any reason. Clarification of information may be requested by the city. 
                  b.  The RFQ process will be the method of procurement when the professional services exceed $25,000.00 and/or the project costs exceed $1,000,000.00 for the procurement of services within the scope of architecture, registered interior design, professional engineering, land surveying, and landscape architecture. 
                  (2)  Multi-step solicitation. The city may initiate one of the multi-step solicitation processes described below when: (a) in the city's discretion, it is impractical to prepare an adequate or complete description of the goods or services desired (due to insufficient data, uncertain requirements, unfamiliar market options, etc.), (b) the city desires to identify a field of qualified bidders, proposers, goods or services, out of a broader field of bidders, proposers, goods or services, or (c) the city believes a multi-step process would best serve its purposes. 
                  a.  Consecutive multi-step process : 
                  1.  The city may request statements of qualifications to be evaluated based on the criteria in the RFQ for purposes of identifying one or more desirable or acceptable goods, services, or professional services or for purposes of identifying a field of qualified or most qualified bidders or proposers. 
                  2.  After identifying a field of most qualified bidders or proposers with the capability of providing the desirable or acceptable goods, services, or professional services, the city may either follow a competitive ITB process or by a RFP process among the field of vendors identified as having the capability to meet the city's requirements for the procurement. 
                  b.  Consecutive multi-step process to award standby purchasing contracts : A standby contract is an agreement between the City of South Fulton and an entity performing a professional or technical service. The use of standby contracts will be at the discretion of the city manager. The contract thresholds are subject to the bidding thresholds established in this chapter. The entities selected through this process are intended to create a pool of qualified vendors to be used on a rotational basis, or with the informal procurement process. 
                  1.  When it is in the best interest of the city to have pre-qualified, standby purchasing contracts because of the need to provide quick-response, repetitive services or a range of services or professional services within a specific field of expertise, the city may use consecutive multi-step procurement process to identify one or more standby contractors. The purpose is to identify one or more standby contractors that demonstrate the ability to perform a particular type of service during a specified contract period. 
                  2.  Contract award - The multi-step solicitation shall specify the general types of services required, the selection process to be used, and the selection criteria for award of the standby contract. 
                  3.  Award of a specific scope of work to a standby contractor - During the term of the standby contract(s), specific scopes of work may be developed and awarded to standby contractor(s), by amendment to such standby contract(s), provided that the specific scope of work is consistent with the general types of services upon which award of the continuing contract(s) was made. On an annual basis, the maximum contract amount shall not exceed $1,000,000.00 with task order approval through the city manager. 
                  4.  Except when the standby contract is for the procurement of services within the scope of architecture, registered interior design, professional engineering, land surveying or landscape architecture and when there is more than one standby contractor available to perform the specific scope of work defined, the process for award of the work is set forth below: 
                  (a)  Work may be rotated during the contract period between the standby contractor(s) that were selected to perform the general type of services required; or, 
                  (b)  Quotations, bids or proposals may be requested from the prequalified standby contractors that were selected to perform the general type of services or professional services required. The city may select the standby contractor whose quotation, bid, or proposal is deemed to be most advantageous to the city to perform the specific scope of work required. 
                  5.  City departments shall use the list of approved standby contractors. A user department may choose to either use a rotation or informal bid process as referenced above when using a standby contract. The choice of the department will remain in effect for the term of the contract. This procurement strategy should allow vendors fair and consistent access to projects, improve quality of service delivery and generally increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the procurement process. The vendor rotation process shall include the list of the qualified vendors selected through procurement process to perform the work. The department will maintain a list of the qualified vendors and rotate through each vendor on an established basis. 
                  6.  The informal bid process shall include the list of the qualified vendors selected through the procurement process to perform the work. This procurement strategy will require the departments to obtain at least three quotes for work above $2,501.00 and below the formal bid threshold. If three quotes are not obtained, detailed written explanation is required. 
                  7.  All qualified vendors should be given equal access to projects, and through transparent monthly reporting a list of projects, vendor(s), awards, and purchase amount shall be maintained. If a vendor declines the project a written record shall be maintained, and the vendor shall be invited the next time the vendor's name is in the rotation. 
                  8.  For the professional standby contracts, the department head will be responsible for providing the determination of the professional selection. 
                  (n)  Protests . 
                  (1)  Submission of protest . If a vendor or bidder is aggrieved during pending request for proposals, bids or qualifications, the vendor or bidder can choose to protest in accordance with this section. 
                  a.  Bidders may protest the contract award in connection with the RFQ/ITB/RFP on which the bidder has submitted a bid/proposal. Any such protest by a bidder must be filed no later than ten calendar days following the date of the notice to award and/or conclusion of the RFQ/ITB/RFP, in order to have the protest considered. 
                  b.  A written statement of protest pertaining to events or facts arising during a bid solicitation process, signed by a company officer authorized to sign contracts on behalf of the vendor, must be received by the purchasing department no later than three calendar days prior to the bid due date, with the exception that actions complained of occurring within three days of the bid due date shall be filed within 24 hours of the actions complained of. Failure to file a protest by the time required may be deemed a waiver of any grounds the vendor or bidder has to protest. All inquiries received after the bid award and/or after the conclusion of a RFQ/ITB/RFP will not be considered a formal protest. 
                  (2)  Format of protest . Protests shall include: 
                  a.  The name and address of the protester; 
                  b.  Appropriate identification of the solicitation, and, if a contract has been awarded, its number; 
                  c.  A statement of reasons for the protest, with supporting legal authority; and 
                  d.  Supporting exhibits, evidence, or documents to substantiate any claims unless evidence is not available within the filing time; in which case the expected availability date shall be indicated. 
                  (3)  Filing a protest to notice of non-award . A written statement of protest to notice of non-award by a company officer authorized to sign contracts on behalf of the vendor, must be received by the purchasing department no later than ten calendar days following the date of the notice of non-award. Failure to file a protest by the time required may be deemed a waiver of any grounds the vendor or bidder has to protest. All inquiries received after the ten day period will not be considered a formal protest. 
                  (4)  Stay of procurement during protest. When a protest pertaining to events or facts arising during a pending solicitation under this section (example: protests concerning specifications and evaluation criteria) has been filed no later than the three business days prior to the bid opening or deadline herein, the purchasing department shall suspend the award of a contract until a final decision has been issued, unless the purchasing department makes a written determination, after consulting with the issuing department, that awarding the contract without delay is necessary to protect the best interests of the city. 
                  a.  When a protest has been filed in a timely fashion within ten calendar days following the issuance of a notice of non-award, the purchasing department shall consult with the city manager to determine if performance of the contract without delay is necessary to protect the best interests of the city. 
                  b.  If it is determined that it is necessary to proceed with a contract without delay, the bidder that receives the contingent contract may proceed with performance and receive payment for work performed in strict accordance with the terms of the contract; however, such bidder shall not be entitled to reimbursement for any capital outlay costs, or other up front expenditures incurred in performing the contract. 
                  (5)  Decision by purchasing department . A recommendation will be made by the purchasing department to the city attorney as expeditiously as possible after receiving all relevant requested information in regard to the protest filed. After consultation with the city attorney, the purchasing department will notify the bidder in writing of the decision no later than 30 days after all necessary paperwork is filed. If a protest is sustained, available remedies may include one of the following: 
                  a.  For a protest sustained prior to an award, modification of the solicitation document, including but not limited to specifications, terms and conditions and evaluation criteria; and extension of the opening date, if appropriate. 
                  b.  For a protest sustained after an award is made, suspension or cancellation of the award, re-evaluation and re-award or re-solicitation with appropriate changes to the new solicitation document. 
                  (6)  Appeal . Decisions from the purchasing manager on a solicitation protest may be appealed to the city council. The request for appeal must be filed within seven calendar days of the decision complained of. The decisions of the city council shall be appealed as allowed by law. 
                  (o)  Guidelines for promoting sustainability through the purchasing process. The city is a significant consumer of goods and services. The city desires to encourage the procurement of sustainable and environmentally preferred products and services. The City of South Fulton Mayor and Council have resolved that the city will take an active role to promote the analysis of life cycle costs for products and services to encourage protection of the environment by showing preference for the procurement of sustainable products and services for the use in city operations. 
                  (1)  In general, environmentally preferable products and services are those that would reduce negative effects on human health and environment when compared with the competing products and services. More specifically, this comparison would include consideration of all phases of the product's life cycle, including raw materials acquisition, production, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, operation, maintenance and disposal, including potential for reuse or ability to be recycled. 
                  (2)  In practice, the objective is to purchase products that have been environmentally certified or eco labeled because they have reduced environmental impact due to the way they are made, used, transported, stored, packaged and disposed. It means looking for products that do not harm human health, are less polluting and that minimize waste, maximize use of bio-based or recycled materials, conserve energy and water, and reduce the consumption of and disposal of hazardous materials. 
                  (3)  Reports will be provided to city council on an annual basis to track the success of the environmentally preferable purchasing program that accounts for life cycle costs and gives preference to products that are recycled, recyclable and otherwise more environmentally friendly than traditional products; purchase Energy Star rated equipment and appliances when possible to do so and, purchase recycled copy, computer, and fax paper with at least 30 percent recycled content whenever the use of the paper makes it possible to do so.

                  CHAPTER 10. - FUND BALANCE POLICY 

                  Sec. 1-10001. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  This policy is created in consideration of unanticipated events that could adversely affect the financial condition of the city and jeopardize the continuation of necessary public services in order to address the implications of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 54, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Definitions. 
                  (b)  This policy will ensure that the city maintains adequate fund balances and reserves in order to: 
                  (1)  Provide sufficient cash flow for daily financial needs; 
                  (2)  Secure and maintain investment grade bond ratings; 
                  (3)  Offset significant economic downturns or revenue shortfalls; and 
                  (4)  Provide funds for unforeseen expenditures related to emergencies. 
                  (c)  This policy and the procedures promulgated under it supersede all previous regulations regarding the city's fund balance and reserve policies.

                  Sec. 1-10002. - Fund type definitions. 
                  The following definitions will be used in reporting activity in governmental funds across the city. The city may or may not report all fund types in any given reporting period, based on actual circumstances and activity. 
                  Capital project funds means funds used to account for all financial resources restricted, committed or assigned to expenditure for the acquisition or construction of capital assets. 
                  Debt service funds means funds used to account for all financial resources restricted, committed or assigned to expenditure for principal and interest. 
                  Permanent funds means funds used to account for resources restricted to the extent that only earnings, and not principal, may be used for purposes that support the city's purposes. 
                  Special revenue funds means funds used to account and report the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are restricted or committed to expenditure for specific purposes other than debt services or capital projects. 
                  The general fund means the fund used to account for all financial resources accounted for and reported in another fund. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-021, § 4(1-10002), 9-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-10003. - Fund balance reporting in governmental funds. 
                  Fund balance will be reported in governmental funds under the following categories using the definitions provided by GASB Statement No. 54: 
                  (1)  Nonspendable fund balance. Includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either not in spendable form or legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. Nonspendable amounts will be determined before all other classifications and consist of the following items (as applicable in any given fiscal year): 
                  a.  The city will maintain a fund balance equal to the balance of any long-term outstanding balances due from others (including other funds of the city). 
                  b.  The city will maintain a fund balance equal to the value of inventory balances and prepaid items (to the extent that such balances are not offset with liabilities and actually result in fund balance). 
                  c.  The city will maintain a fund balance equal to the corpus (principal) of any permanent funds that are legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. 
                  d.  The city will maintain a fund balance equal to the balance of any land or other non-financial assets held for sale. 
                  (2)  Restricted fund balance. Includes amounts that can be spent only for the specific purposes stipulated by the constitution, external resource providers, or through enabling legislation. 
                  (3)  Committed fund balance. Includes amounts that can be used only for the specific purposes determined by a formal action of the city council. Commitments will only be used for specific purposes pursuant to a formal action of the city council. A majority vote is required to approve or remove a commitment. 
                  (4)  Assigned fund balance. Includes amounts intended to be used by the city for specific purposes but do not meet the criteria to be classified as restricted or committed. In governmental funds other than the general fund, assigned fund balance represents the remaining amount that is not restricted or committed. The city council delegates the city financial officer the authority to assign amounts to be used for specific purposes. Such assignments cannot exceed the available (spendable, unrestricted, uncommitted) fund balance in any particular fund. 
                  (5)  Unassigned fund balance. Includes the residual classification for the city's general fund and includes all spendable amounts not contained in the other classifications. In other funds, the unassigned classification should be used only to report a deficit balance from overspending for specific purposes for which amounts had been restricted, committed, or assigned. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-021, § 4(1-10003), 9-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-10004. - Operational guidelines. 
                  The following guidelines address the classification and use of fund balance in governmental funds: 
                  (1)  Classifying fund balance amounts. Fund balance classifications depict the nature of the net resources that are reported in a governmental fund. An individual governmental fund may include nonspendable resources and amounts that are restricted, committed, or assigned, or any combination of those classifications. The general fund may also include an unassigned amount. 
                  (2)  Encumbrance reporting. Encumbering amounts for specific purposes for which resources have already been restricted, committed or assigned should not result in separate display of encumbered amounts. Encumbered amounts for specific purposes for which amounts have not been previously restricted, committed or assigned, will be classified as committed or assigned, as appropriate, based on the definitions and criteria set forth in GASB Statement No. 54. 
                  (3)  Prioritization of fund balance use. When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted (committed, assigned, or unassigned) amounts are available, it shall be the policy of the city to consider restricted amounts to have been reduced first. When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which amounts in any of the unrestricted fund balance classifications could be used, it shall be the policy of the city that the committed amounts would be reduced first, followed by assigned amounts and then unassigned amounts. 
                  (4)  Minimum unassigned fund balance. Except during the transition period, the city will maintain a minimum unassigned fund balance in its general fund of 12 percent of the subsequent year's budgeted expenditures. This minimum fund balance is to protect against cash flow shortfalls related to timing of projected revenue receipts and to maintain a budget stabilization commitment. 
                  (5)  Replenishing deficiencies. 
                  a.  When fund balance falls below the minimum 12 percent, the city will replenish shortages/deficiencies using the budget strategies and timeframes described below. 
                  1.  The city will reduce recurring expenditures to eliminate any structural deficit; or 
                  2.  The city will increase revenues or pursue other fund sources; or 
                  3.  A combination of the two options above. 
                  b.  Minimum fund balance deficiencies shall be replenished within the following time periods: 
                  1.  A deficiency resulting in a minimum fund balance between 12 percent and ten percent of the subsequent year's budgeted expenditures shall be replenished over a period not to exceed one year. 
                  2.  A deficiency resulting in a minimum fund balance between ten percent and six percent of the subsequent year's budgeted expenditures shall be replenished over a period not to exceed three years. 
                  (6)  Surplus fund balance. Fund balance will be considered a surplus if over 12 percent of the subsequent year's budgeted expenditures. Should unassigned fund balance of the general fund ever exceed 11 percent, the city will consider such fund balance surpluses for one-time expenditures that are nonrecurring in nature.

                  Sec. 1-10005. - Implementation and review. 
                  Upon adoption of this policy the city council authorizes the finance department to establish any standards and procedures which may be necessary for its implementation. When the need arises, the finance department shall make any necessary recommendation to the city council for changes to this policy.

                  CHAPTER 11. - DEBT POLICY 

                  Sec. 1-11001. - Introduction. 
                  (a)  The City of South Fulton recognizes that one of the keys to sound financial management is a debt policy. These benefits are recognized by bond rating agencies and the development of a debt policy is a recommended practice by the Government Finance Officers Association. A debt policy establishes the parameters for issuing and managing debt. It provides guidelines regarding the timing and purposes for which debt may be issued, presents the types of permissible debt, and the methods of sale that may be used. The debt policy should recognize an obligation to fully and timely repay all debt as an essential requirement for entry into the capital markets. Adherence to a debt policy helps to ensure that a government maintains a sound financial position and that credit quality is protected. 
                  (b)  The debt policy is to be used in conjunction with the operating and capital budgets, the Capital Improvement Program (CIP), and other financial policies. The advantages of a debt policy are: 
                  (1)  Enhancing the quality of decisions; 
                  (2)  Documenting the decision-making process; 
                  (3)  Identifying objectives for staff to implement; 
                  (4)  Demonstrating a commitment to long-term financial planning objectives; and 
                  (5)  Being viewed positively by the bond rating agencies. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1(1-11001), 9-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-11002. - Debt instruments. 
                  (a)  General obligation bonds are bonds secured by a promise to levy taxes in an amount necessary to pay debt service, principal and interest, coming due each fiscal year. General obligations bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the city. These bonds are authorized by a referendum or by non-voted (two-thirds) authorization by the governing body. The non-voted authorization allows governments to issue up to two-thirds of the previous year's net debt reduction without a referendum. 
                  (b)  Revenue bonds are a pledge of the revenues generated by the debt financed asset or by the operating system of which that asset is a part. 
                  (c)  Special obligation bonds are bonds that are payable from the pledge of revenues other than locally levied taxes. Examples include the beer and wine tax or enterprise revenues. 
                  (d)  Certificates of Participation (COPs) are an alternative financing method that does not require voter approval. These certificates represent an undivided interest in the payments made by a public agency pursuant to a financing lease or an installment purchase agreement. The security for this financing is represented by a lien on the property acquired or constructed. The city uses COPs for city facilities. 
                  (e)  An installment purchase contract is an agreement in which the equipment or property is acquired and periodic payments, which are sufficient to pay debt service, are made. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1(1-11001), 9-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-11003. - City debt policy. 
                  (a)  Long-term debt shall not be used to finance ongoing operational expenses. 
                  (b)  Any debt issued shall not have a maturity date beyond the useful life of the asset being acquired or constructed by the debt proceeds. 
                  (c)  The city shall establish an affordable debt level to preserve credit quality and ensure sufficient revenue is available to pay annual debt service. This will be balanced against the city's need to maintain its infrastructure and manage growth. 
                  (1)  The city will use appropriate debt instruments to provide funding for capital assets at the lowest cost with minimal risk. The city will monitor its debt positions to maintain the lowest effective cost. 
                  (2)  The city will, at all times, manage its debt and sustain its strong financial position, including healthy reserves, to seek and maintain the highest credit rating possible. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1(1-11002), 9-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-11004. - Purposes for debt issuance. 
                  The city may issue debt for the purpose of acquiring or constructing capital assets including land, buildings, machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures. When feasible, debt issuance will be pooled together to minimize issuance expense. Annually, the city will prepare and adopt a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) to identify and establish an orderly plan to meet the city's infrastructure needs. The CIP will also identify all debt-funded projects and the related debt service impact. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1(1-11003), 9-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-11005. - Debt Structure. 
                  (a)  Debt will be paid off in a timeframe that is less than or meets the useful life of the asset or project acquired through the financing. The life of the debt, interest mode and principal maturity schedule make up the structure of the debt. This debt could be general obligation, revenue or special obligation bonds, certificates of participation or other installment financing agreements. 
                  (b)  The city will consider various financing techniques including fixed or variable interest rate debt and interest rate swap agreements in order to minimize the interest costs over the life of the issue. The use of these techniques will be evaluated based on market conditions and the maximum benefit to the city while minimizing the city's risk. The city will limit the ratio of unhedged variable rate debt to 35 percent of the total outstanding debt. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1(1-11004), 9-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-11006. - Debt ratios. 
                  (a)  The city shall abide by the following debt ratios: 
                  (1)  Overall debt as a percentage of assessed valuation. This ratio measures debt levels against the property tax base which generates the tax revenues that are the main source of debt repayment. The ceiling for this ratio is 10.0 percent. 
                  (2)  Overall debt per capita. This ratio measures the burden of debt placed on the size of the population supporting the debt and is widely used by rating analysts as a measure of an issuers' ability to repay debt. This measure will not exceed $2,200.00. 
                  (3)  General debt service as a percentage of operational expenditures. This ratio reflects the city's budgetary flexibility to adapt spending levels and respond to economic condition changes. This ratio is targeted at a level of 12 percent with a ceiling of 14 percent. The city's policy is to manage to the target of 12 percent. The ceiling of 14 percent is meant to provide flexibility in extraordinary circumstances. 
                  (4)  Ten-year payout ratio. This ratio reflects the amortization of the city's outstanding debt. A faster payout is considered to be a positive credit attribute. The city will maintain a floor for its ten-year payout of 64 percent. 
                  (b)  These ratios will be calculated and reported each year in conjunction with the capital budget process, the annual financial audit and as needed for fiscal analysis. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1(1-11005), 9-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-11007 - Debt management policies. 
                  (a)  The city will issue debt only for the purposes of constructing or acquiring capital assets and for making major renovations to existing capital assets. 
                  (b)  The city shall not construct or acquire a public facility if it is unable to adequately provide for the subsequent annual operation and maintenance costs of the facility. 
                  (c)  The city will ensure that adequate systems of internal control exist so as to provide reasonable assurance as to compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and covenants associated with outstanding debt. 
                  (d)  The city will manage debt issuance to comply with the adopted debt limits and will evaluate those limits at least every five years. 
                  (e)  The city will attempt to structure debt in the best and most appropriate manner consistent with the financial policies of the city to level principal repayment and minimize interest expense. 
                  (f)  The city will monitor its outstanding debt in relation to existing conditions in the debt market and will refund any outstanding debt when sufficient cost savings can be realized or utilize interest rate swap agreements to achieve cost savings. 
                  (g)  To reduce the impact of capital programs on future years, the city will fund a portion of its CIP on a pay-as-you-go basis by: 
                  •  Appropriating proceeds from all city sales for capital projects. 
                  •  Pay-as-you-go funding will save money by eliminating interest expense on the funded projects. Pay-as-you-go capital appropriations improve financial flexibility in the event of sudden revenue shortfalls or emergency spending. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1(1-11006), 9-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-11008. - Administration and implementation. 
                  The city manager and the chief financial officer are responsible for the administration and issuance of debt including the completion of specific tasks and responsibilities included in this policy. The city will evaluate the debt policy at least every five years. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1(1-11007), 9-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-11009. - Capital planning and debt determination. 
                  (a)  The citizens capital budget advisory committee (CCBAC) appointed by the city council, reviews departments' and other agencies' capital requests and recommends capital projects based on needs. The city manager provides a recommended capital improvement program (CIP) for consideration by the city council. The city council then approves both a five-year needs assessment and an annual capital budget. The city council adopts capital projects ordinances which provide budgetary authority. 
                  (b)  Funding of the capital budget will be determined in conjunction with the approval of the CIP by the city council. Available pay-as-you-go funding and debt issuance will be allocated to fund the CIP based on the debt management policy. Debt financing will also be considered for equipment items that normally do not go through the CCBAC, but are included in departmental requests. 
                  (c)  All voted authorizations for those purposes authorized by the Local Government Bond Act will be scheduled for referendum in November at the time of the general election. When possible, the city will utilize the non-voted (two-thirds) bond authorization for bonds to fund projects, such as government facilities. 
                  (d)  The city uses a combination of bonds and Certificates of Participation (COPS) to finance capital assets. COPs do not require voter approval but do require collateral as security. COPs are usually used to finance projects deemed essential by the governing body and timing is such that it is impractical to seek voter approval. 
                  (e)  Any capital item that has not been included in either of the above two processes, but because of its critical or emergency nature where timing was not anticipated in the CIP or budgetary process, or is mandated immediately by either state or federal requirements, will be considered for financing by installment purchase contract. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1(1-11008), 9-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-11010. - Issuance of debt. 
                  (a)  The scheduling and amount of bond sales and installment purchase transactions will be recommended by the chief financial officer and the city manager. The city council must approve the sale. These decisions will be based upon the identified cash flow requirements for each project to be financed, market conditions, and other relevant factors including the debt ratios. If the cash requirements for capital projects are minimal in any given year, the city may choose not to issue debt. Instead, the city may fund upfront project costs and reimburse these costs when financing is arranged. In these situations, the city will adopt a reimbursement resolution prior to the expenditure of project funds. 
                  (b)  Variable rate bonds, revenue and special obligation bonds and COPs will be sold on a negotiated basis with the underwriter selection determined through a competitive process. Underwriters will be selected for each issue based on the experience and expertise necessary for that issue. 
                  (c)  Debt service for each issue will be structured to level out the city's total debt service payments over the life of the debt portfolio. This structuring also assists in minimizing the interest payments over the life of the issue. Structuring must take into consideration current market conditions and practices in the municipal finance market. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1(1-11009), 9-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 1-11011. - Legality. 
                  The city must receive an opinion acceptable to the market from a nationally recognized law firm that each financing transaction complies with applicable law and all agreements in connection with any financing are legal, valid and binding obligations of the city.

                  Sec. 1-11012. - Interest rate exchange agreements. 
                  The term "interest rate exchange agreement" shall mean a written contract entered into in connection with the issuance of city debt or in connection with city debt already outstanding with a counterparty to provide for an exchange of payments based upon fixed and/or variable interest rates. The city will govern the use of interest rate exchange agreements by the policy described in attachment I to this debt management policy.

                  Sec. 1-11013. - Continuing disclosure. 
                  The city will provide on-going disclosure information to established national information repositories and maintain compliance with disclosure standards promulgated by state and national regulatory agencies. The city will maintain good communications with bond rating agencies to inform them about the city's financial position by providing them the city's comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR) and operating and capital improvements budget.

                  Sec. 1-11014. - Arbitrage rebate reporting. 
                  The city will comply with all arbitrage rebate requirements as established by the Internal Revenue Service and all disclosure requirements established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This effort includes tracking investment earnings on bond proceeds, calculating rebate payments in compliance with the tax law and remitting rebatable earnings to the federal government in a timely manner to preserve the tax-exempt status of the city's outstanding debt issues.

                  ATTACHMENT I. - CITY OF SOUTH FULTON INTEREST RATE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT POLICY 
                  This policy will govern the use by City of South Fulton (the "city") of Interest Rate Exchange Agreements. "Interest Rate Exchange Agreement" shall mean a written contract entered into in connection with the issuance of city debt or in connection with city debt already outstanding with a counterparty to provide for an exchange of payments based upon fixed and/or variable interest rates. The failure by the city to comply with any provision of this policy will not invalidate or impair any Interest Rate Exchange Agreement. 
                  The Conditions under Which Interest Rate Exchange Agreements  May Be Entered Into 
                  Purposes. Interest Rate Exchange Agreements may be used for the following purposes only to: 
                  (1)  Achieve significant savings as compared to a product available in the bond market if the use of derivatives helps to achieve diversification of a particular bond offering; 
                  (2)  Enhance investment returns within prudent risk guidelines; 
                  (3)  Prudently hedge risk in the context of a particular financing or the overall asset/liability management of the city; 
                  (4)  Incur variable rate exposure within prudent guidelines; 
                  (5)  Achieve more flexibility in meeting overall financial objectives than available in conventional markets; and 
                  (6)  Accomplish a financial objective not otherwise obtainable using traditional financing methods. 
                  Legality. The city must receive an opinion acceptable to the market from a nationally recognized law firm that the Interest Rate Exchange Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the city and entering into the transaction complies with applicable law. 
                  Speculation. Interest Rate Exchange Agreements shall not be used for speculative purposes. Associated risks will be prudent risks that are appropriate for the city to take. 
                  Methods by Which Such Contracts Shall be Solicited and Procured 
                  In general, the city should procure Interest Rate Exchange Agreements by competitive bidding. The city shall determine which parties it will allow to participate in a competitive transaction. The city has the right to accept matching bids to diversify counterparty risk or reward firms for ideas and work performed. The parameters for the bid must be disclosed in writing to all potential bidders. 
                  Notwithstanding the above, the city may procure Interest Rate Exchange Agreements by negotiated methods when the city makes a determination that, due to the size or complexity of a particular swap, a negotiated transaction would result in the most favorable pricing and terms or innovation. 
                  To facilitate the procurement of Interest Rate Exchange Agreements, the city will engage an independent financial advisory firm to assist in the price negotiations, in the development of terms and in risk assessment. The city shall obtain an independent opinion that the terms and conditions of the Interest Rate Exchange Agreement reflect a fair market value of such agreement as of the date of its execution. 
                  Form and Content of Interest Rate Exchange Agreements 
                  To the extent possible, the Interest Rate Exchange Agreements entered into by the city shall contain the terms and conditions set forth in the International Swap and Derivatives Association, Inc. ("ISDA") Master Agreement, including any schedules and confirmation. The schedule should be modified to reflect specific legal requirements and business terms desired by the city. 
                  The city shall consider including provisions that permit the city to assign its rights and obligations under the Interest Rate Exchange Agreement and to optionally terminate the agreement at its market value at any time. In general, the counterparty shall not have the right to optionally terminate an agreement. 
                  Events of default. Events of default of a counterparty shall include the following: 
                  (1)  Failure to make payments when due; 
                  (2)  Material breach of representations and warranties; 
                  (3)  Illegality; 
                  (4)  Failure to comply with downgrade provisions; and/or 
                  (5)  Failure to comply with any other provisions of the agreement after a specified notice period. 
                  The city will have the right to terminate the agreement upon an event of default by the counterparty. Upon such termination, the counterparty will be the "defaulting party" for purposes of calculating the termination payment owed. 
                  Aspects of Risk Exposure Associated with Such Contracts 
                  Before entering into an Interest Rate Exchange Agreement, the city shall evaluate all the risks inherent in the transaction. These risks to be evaluated could include: 
                  (1)  Counterparty risk — the risk of a payment default on a swap by an issuer's counterparty; 
                  (2)  Termination risk — the risk that a swap has a negative value and the issuer owes a breakage fee if the contract has to be terminated; 
                  (3)  Rollover risk — the risk of a failed remarketing or auction with respect to any variable rate bonds associated with a swap; or the risk that an issuer cannot secure a cost-effective renewal of a letter or line of credit; 
                  (4)  Basis risk — the risk that floating rate cash flow streams may diverge from each other; 
                  (5)  Tax event risk — the risk that the spread between taxable and tax-exempt rates will change as a result of changes in income tax laws or other conditions; and 
                  (6)  Amortization risk — the risk that the amortization of the swap will not be fully integrated with the amortization of the underlying bonds. 
                  The city shall endeavor to diversify its exposure to counterparties. To that end, before entering into a transaction, it should determine its exposure to the relevant counterparty or counterparties and determine how the proposed transaction would affect the exposure. The exposure should not be measured solely in terms of notional amount, but also how changes in interest rates would affect the city's "Value at Risk" exposure for outstanding agreements. 
                  Counterparty Selection Criteria 
                  The city may enter into an Interest Rate Exchange Agreement if the counterparty has at least two long-term unsecured credit ratings in the double A category from Fitch, Moody's, or SandP and the counterparty has demonstrated experience in successfully executing Interest Rate Exchange Agreements. If after entering into an agreement the ratings of the counterparty are downgraded below the ratings required, then the agreement shall be subject to termination unless: 
                  (1)  The counterparty provides either a substitute guarantor or assigns the agreement, in either case, to a party meeting the rating criteria reasonably acceptable to the city or 
                  (2)  The counterparty (or guarantor) collateralizes the Interest Rate Exchange Agreement in accordance with the criteria set forth in this Policy and the Interest Rate Exchange Agreement. 
                  Provisions for Collateralization 
                  Should the rating of the counterparty, or if secured, the entity unconditionally guaranteeing its payment obligations not satisfy the requirements of the Counterparty Selection Criteria, then the obligations of the counterparty shall be fully and continuously collateralized by: 
                  (1)  Direct obligations of, or obligations the principal and interest on which are guaranteed by, the United States of America; or 
                  (2)  Direct obligations of U.S. Agencies and such collateral shall be deposited with the city or an agent thereof. The specific collateral requirements for each Interest Rate Agreement shall be set forth in the corresponding swap documentation. 
                  Long-Term Implications 
                  In evaluating a transaction involving the use of Interest Rate Exchange Agreements, the city shall review long-term implications associated with entering into Interest Rate Exchange Agreements, including costs of borrowing, historical interest rate trends, variable rate capacity, credit enhancement capacity, opportunities to refund related debt obligations and other similar considerations. 
                  Methods to be Used to Reflect Such Contracts in the City's Financial Statements 
                  The city shall reflect the use of Interest Rate Exchange Agreements on its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
                  Monitoring 
                  The city shall monitor the performance of Interest Rate Exchange Agreements and may employ a financial advisor to assist in evaluating the effectiveness of its Agreements. A written report, provided at a minimum quarterly, shall include at least: 
                  (1)  Preparing a description of each contract, including a summary of its terms and conditions, the notional amount, rates, maturity and other provisions thereof; 
                  (2)  Determining any amounts which were required to be paid and received, and that the amounts were paid and received; 
                  (3)  Determining that each counterparty is in compliance with its rating requirements; 
                  (4)  Determining that each counterparty is in compliance with the downgrade provisions, if applicable (See Counterparty Selection Criteria); 
                  (5)  Assessing the counterparty risk, termination risk, basis risk and other risks, which shall include the marked to market value for each counterparty and relative exposure compared to other counterparties and a calculation of the city's Value at Risk for each counterparty; and 
                  (6)  Determining, at least quarterly, that all posted collateral, if required, has a net market value of at least the collateral in the Interest Rate Agreement.

                  Sec. 2-9002. - Purpose. 
                  The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services. 
                  In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, this city council, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations at Chapter 61, Urban Redevelopment, of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread. 
                  In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Chapter IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

                  (a)  In order for a parcel of real property to be officially designated as maintained in a blighted condition and subject to increased taxation, the following steps must be completed: 
                  (1)  An inspection must be performed on the parcel of property. In order for an inspection to be performed, 
                  a.  A request may be made by the public officer or by at least five residents of the city for inspection of a parcel of property, said inspection to be based on the criteria as delineated in ordinance, or 
                  b.  The public officer may cause a survey of existing housing conditions to be performed, or may refer to any such survey conducted or finalized within the previous five years, to locate or identify any parcels which may be in a blighted condition and for which a full inspection should be conducted to determine if that parcel of property meets the criteria set out in this chapter for designation as being maintained in a blighted condition. 
                  (2)  A written inspection report of the findings for any parcel of property inspected pursuant to subsection (1) above shall be prepared and submitted to the public officer. Where feasible, photographs of the conditions found to exist on the property on the date of inspection shall be made and supplement the inspection report. Where compliance with minimum construction, housing, occupancy, fire and life safety codes in effect within the city are in question, the inspection shall be conducted by a certified inspector possessing the requisite qualifications to determine minimal code compliance. 
                  (3)  Following completion of the inspection report, the public officer shall make a determination, in writing, that a property is maintained in a blighted condition, as defined by this chapter, and is subject to increased taxation.

Service in the manner set forth at O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12 shall constitute sufficient notice to the property's owner or person chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes for purpose of this section, except that posting of the notice on the property will not be required. 
                  (b)  The written notice given to the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes shall notify such person of the public officer's determination the real property is being maintained in a blighted condition and shall advise such person of the hours and location at which the person may inspect and obtain the public officer's determination and any supporting documentation. Persons notified that real property of which the person(s) is chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes shall have 30 days from the receipt of notice in which to request a hearing before the city's municipal court. Written request for hearing shall be filed with the public officer and shall be date stamped upon receipt. Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the public officer shall notify the municipal court and the building inspector or person who performed the inspection and prepared the inspection report. 
                  (c)  Within 30 days of the receipt of a request for hearing, the municipal court clerk shall set a date, time and location for the hearing and shall give at least ten business days notice to the person(s) requesting the hearing, the public officer and the building inspector or person who performed the inspection and prepared the inspection report. Notice of scheduled hearings shall be published as a legal advertisement in the Daily Reporter, or other designated legal organ in Fulton County, at least five days prior to the hearing. Hearings may be continued by the municipal court judge upon request of any party, for good cause. 
                  (d)  At the hearing, the public officer shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject property is maintained in a blighted condition, as defined by this chapter. The municipal court judge shall cause a record of the evidence submitted at the hearing to be maintained. Upon hearing from the public officer and/or their witnesses and the person(s) requesting the hearing and/or their witnesses, the judge of municipal court shall make a determination either affirming or reversing the determination of the public officer. The determination shall be in writing and copies thereof shall be served on the parties by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery. The determination by the court shall be deemed final. A copy of such determination shall also be served upon the Tax Commissioner of Fulton County, who shall include the increased tax on the next regular tax bill rendered on behalf of the city. 
                  (e)  Persons aggrieved by the determination of the court affirming the determination of the public officer may petition the Superior Court of Fulton County for a writ of certiorari within 30 days of issuance of the court's written determination.

                  (b)  Such increased ad valorem tax shall be applied and reflected in the first tax bill rendered following official designation of a real property as blighted. 
                  (c)  Revenues arising from the increased rate of ad valorem taxation shall, upon receipt, be segregated by the city manager and used only for community redevelopment purposes, as identified in an approved urban redevelopment program, including defraying the cost of the city's program to close, repair, or demolish unfit building and structures.

                  (b)  Before action on a petition to lift the designation, the public officer shall cause the property to be thoroughly inspected by a building inspector who, by written inspection report, shall certify that all requisite work has been performed to applicable code in a workmanlike manner, in accordance with the specifications of the plan of remedial action or redevelopment, or applicable court order. Upon finding required work to be satisfactorily performed, the public officer shall issue a written determination that the real property is no longer maintained in a blighted condition. Copies of this determination shall be served upon the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes, and upon the Tax Commissioner of Fulton County. 
                  (c)  All plans for remedial action or redevelopment shall be in writing, signed by the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes on the real property and the director of the city's community development service department, and contain the following:

                  Sec. 2-9007. - Decrease of tax rate. 
                  (a)  Real property which has had its designation as maintained in a blighted condition removed by the public officer, as provided in this chapter, shall be eligible for a decrease in the rate of city ad valorem taxation by applying a factor of 0.5 to the city millage rate applied to the property, so that such property shall be taxed at a lower millage rate than the millage rate generally applied in the municipality or otherwise provided by general law; such decreased rate of taxation shall be applied beginning with the next tax bill rendered following removal of official designation of a real property as blighted. The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every $25,000.00 or portion thereof equaling one year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than four successive years. 
                  (b)  In order to claim entitlement for a decreased rate of taxation, the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property shall submit a notarized affidavit to the public officer, supported by receipts or other evidence of payment, of the amount expended.

The building official may revoke a permit upon determination by the building official that the construction erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation or replacement of the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of the construction codes. 
                  (e)  Unsafe buildings or systems. All buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems which are unsafe, unsanitary, or do not provide adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which, in relation to existing use, constitute a hazard to safety or health, are considered unsafe buildings or service systems.

Said duty to maintain property in a clean and sanitary condition shall include the duty to cut and remove undergrowth, such as kudzu, briars, weeds in excess of 24 inches in height, honeysuckle, other vines and seedlings, whenever such undergrowth becomes a nuisance to persons residing in the area or operating businesses in the area.

The cost of such action shall be a debtor lien upon the property so cleaned and rendered sanitary and a debt against the owner, tenant, agent, or other party in charge of the property. The debtor lien shall date from the completion of the work on the property as declared under city council ordinance. 
                  (d)  A written statement shall be furnished by the city clerk to the owner, agent, or other party in charge of the property subject to the assessment provided for herein showing the amount of the assessment.

                  (e)  Any owner, tenant, agent, or other party in control of property subject to assessment as provided herein who fails or refuses to pay to the city the amount of such assessment at the expiration of 30 days after the service of the notice of statement provided above, the city clerk shall issue an execution bearing date of its issuance in the name of the mayor of the city and specifying the purpose for which it is issued against the owner, tenant, agent, or other party in control of the property subject to the assessment and also against the property of the owner, tenant, agent, or other party in control of the property upon which the work in question is performed. The execution shall assert and be a lien against the property from the day of the completion of the performance of the work hereinbefore described and shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from the date on which it is issued. For the purposes of this section, any period of less than one month shall be considered to be one month. 
                  (f)  The execution issued under these provisions shall be delivered to the chief of police or a designee thereof who shall execute the same by levying upon and selling the property described therein or so much thereof as may be necessary for the amount due the city from the doing of such work, together with all costs that may accrue thereon. The law applicable to the sales under other executions issued by the city shall apply to the levy, notice, advertisement and sale made under the execution, and the levying officer shall have authority to execute a deed to the purchaser when the property is sold and shall deliver the possession thereof to the purchaser within the time required by law as under tax executions.

                  (a)  General. No member of the code enforcement board shall have the power to initiate enforcement proceedings under this chapter. If a violation of any provision of the Code of Laws is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator and specify a reasonable time to correct the violation. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified, the code inspector may so notify the violator, but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. If a violation is not corrected within the time specified, the code inspector shall request a hearing before the code enforcement board. 
                  (b)  Notification. If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the code enforcement board and request a hearing. The case may be presented to the code enforcement board even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice for the violator shall so state. The matter shall be scheduled for the next available hearing before the code enforcement board, and notice of the hearing shall be given as provided in section 3-4006. 
                  (c)  Violation presents threat to public welfare. If the code inspector has substantial reason to believe a violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and immediately notify the code enforcement board and request a hearing. 
                  (d)  Continuance. The code enforcement board may continue the hearing from time to time for good cause. The code enforcement board shall, in all instances, reach a decision within 15 calendar days from the date of the final hearing at which receipt of all evidence has been concluded. 
                  (e)  Postponed hearing. When a quorum if not present, or the code enforcement board is unable to reach a decision on a case, the hearing shall be postponed until the next scheduled code enforcement board meeting, with notification provided in accordance with section 3-4006. 
                  (f)  Order to comply/order to pay fine. Every order to comply and/or order to pay fine entered by the code enforcement board shall be executed by the chairperson, or, in the chairperson's absence, the vice-chairperson, and shall be filed in the office of the secretary to the code enforcement board. 
                  (g)  Variances. The code enforcement board, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of the construction codes to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the construction codes or public interest, and also finds all of the following: 
                  (1)  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure, or service system involved and which are not applicable to others. 
                  (2)  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant. 
                  (3)  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the construction codes to other buildings, structures, or service systems. 
                  (4)  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure, or service system. 
                  (5)  That the grant of the variance will be consistent with the general intent and purpose of the construction codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
                  In granting the variance, the code enforcement board may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the code enforcement board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the construction codes. Violation of the conditions of a variance shall be deemed a violation of the construction codes.

The notice shall be in a form approved by the city manager and shall include a reference to the provisions of the Code of Laws and/or conditions of zoning being violated, and the date, time and location of the hearing. 
                  (b)  At the option of the code enforcement board, and in addition to the notice described above, or if repeated attempts at providing notice as described above are unsuccessful, notice of the hearing may be published 30 days prior to the hearing once a week for four consecutive weeks in the newspaper in which the sheriffs advertisements are printed for Fulton County. Proof of publication shall be provided and maintained for the official record. 
                  (c)  Where efforts to provide notice pursuant to subsection (a) of this section are unsuccessful, evidence of an attempt to serve the alleged violator pursuant to subsection (a) of this section together with proof of publication as provided in subsection (b) of this section shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this section have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-012, § 1(3-4006), 7-11-2017; Ord. No. 2017-016, 8-22-2017)

                  (a)  If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the code enforcement board finds that a violation does exist, the code enforcement board may issue an order to comply consistent with the powers granted in this chapter, with findings and conclusions. An order to comply shall set forth the street address or a description of the structure and/or premises sufficient for identification. An order to comply shall include notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that an administrative fine may be imposed if the order is not complied with by said date.

                  (3)  Number and extent of separate items that must be completed in order to bring the building or premises into compliance with the relevant codes; 
                  (4)  Length of time the violation(s) has been known to exist and the amount of time the code inspector has previously given for compliance; 
                  (5)  The existence or nonexistence of mitigating factors which caused the building or premises to be in violation or which may affect the amount of time for compliance; 
                  (6)  The code enforcement board may divide the violation(s) into groups requiring compliance at various intervals, with inspections to be conducted at each stage by the code inspector; 
                  (7)  Whether the person coming before the code enforcement board, or if the person is a corporation, whether any of its officers, members, or directors have been found liable for previous violations. 
                  (b)  An order to pay fine shall specify the fine amount as determined and voted upon by the code enforcement board, as well as the date and time the fine is due. 
                  (1)  A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the city and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest or assigns. If an order to pay fine is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the fine is paid by the date and time specified in the order, the code enforcement board shall issue an order acknowledging that the fine has been paid in full and such order shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging the payment of a fine. 
                  (2)  The code enforcement board may issue an order to pay a fine against the violator if the cited violation was not corrected within the time specified on the code inspector's notice or if an order to comply was not satisfied within the time specified in said order, even if said violation was corrected and brought into compliance prior to the hearing at which the fine was imposed.

                  The code enforcement board shall provide the violator a copy of the order to comply and/or the order to pay the fine by at least hand delivery or certified United States mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, within a reasonable period of time after the decision.

                  (a)  A certified copy of an order to pay fine may be recorded in the public records of the city and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the superior court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of the state, including levy against personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the code enforcement board may request that the county attorney foreclose on the lien. 
                  (b)  No lien imposed under this chapter shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order to pay fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in Superior Court.

The city may appeal to the zoning board of appeals a decision of the planning commission. The failure of a city official, department, board, commission, or agency to act shall not be construed to be an order, requirement or decision within the meaning of this division. A person shall be considered aggrieved for purposes of this subsection only if: 
                  (1)  Said person or said person's property was the subject of the action appealed from; or 
                  (2)  Said person has a substantial interest in the action appealed from that is in danger of suffering special damage or injury not common to all property owners similarly situated.

                  (c)  Appeal stays all legal proceedings.

In such a case, proceedings shall be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the Superior Court of Fulton County. 
                  (d)  Time of hearing. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal and give notice thereof pursuant to the requirements of section 5-6012 as well as due notice to the parties in interest. Any party may appear at the hearing in person, by an agent, by an attorney or by a written documentation.

                  (2)  Signs shall be posted within the public right-of-way or on the subject property at least 15 days before the hearing before the board.

                  (f)  Decision of the board. Following the consideration of all testimony, documentary evidence, and matters of record, the zoning board of appeals shall make a determination on the matter before it. The zoning board of appeals shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time but in no event more than 60 days from the date of the hearing. An appeal shall be sustained only upon an expressed finding by the board that the administrative official's action was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or that the administrative official acted in an arbitrary manner. In exercising its powers, the zoning board of appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit provided all requirements imposed by all other applicable laws are met.

                  Sec. 6-2021. - Indemnification and hold harmless. 
                  The company agrees to indemnify, defend and save harmless the city, its agents, officers and employees, against and from any and all claims by or on behalf of any person, firm, corporation or other entity arising from any negligent act or omission or willful misconduct of the company, or any of its agents, contractors, servants, employees or contractors, and from and against all costs, counsel fees, expenses and liabilities incurred in or about any such claim or proceeding brought thereon. Promptly after receipt from any third party by the city of a written notice of any demand, claim or circumstance that, immediately or with the lapse of time, would give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an "asserted claim") that may result in losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, the city shall give written notice thereof (the "claims notice") to the company provided, however, that a failure to give such notice shall not prejudice the city's right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the company is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The claims notice shall describe the asserted claim in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the losses that have been or may be suffered by the city when such information is available. The company may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any asserted claim. If the company elects to compromise or defend such asserted claim, it shall, within 20 business days following its receipt of the claims notice (or sooner, if the nature of the asserted claim so required), notify the city of its intent to do so, and the city shall cooperate, at the expense of the company, in the compromise of, or defense against, such asserted claim. If the company elects not to compromise or defend the asserted claim, fails to notify the city of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation to provide indemnification under this agreement, the city may pay, compromise or defend such asserted claim with all reasonable costs and expenses borne by the company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the company nor the city shall settle or compromise any claim without the consent of the other party; provided, however, that such consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld. In any event, the city and the company may participate, at their own expense, in the defense of such asserted claim. If the company chooses to defend any asserted claim, the city shall make available to the company any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense.

                  (c)  In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the chief or the chief's designated representative shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community, and other persons of not granting the special variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impact of granting the special variance. Applicants for special variances may be required to submit any information the chief or the chief's representative may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the chief or the chief's representative shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the special variance.

                  (4)  Upon a third conviction within 24 months, measured from the date of the earliest conviction, if the offender has been granted or has applied for an alcohol license as a restaurant or as a late-night establishment, such license shall automatically be suspended as of the date of the conviction, and proceedings initiated to revoke such alcohol license in accordance with the City of South Fulton Alcohol Ordinance. The court shall refer in such third convictions to the attention of the city manager or her or his designee for action consistent with this paragraph. 
                  (b)  Whenever any city resident shall complain to the police department that a dog which habitually barks, howls or yelps, or a cat which habitually cries or howls, is being kept by any person in the city, a city law enforcement officer, prior to the issuance of a citation, shall notify the owner of such dog or cat that a complaint has been received. If the notice given to the owner alleged to be keeping a dog or a cat in violation of this chapter is ineffective, then the police shall issue a formal warning to the owner of such dog or cat that the owner shall take whatever steps necessary to alleviate the barking, howling, yelping or crying. If the warning given to the owner is ineffective, a citation shall be issued to the owner of the dog or cat. 
                  (c)  No provision of this section shall be construed to impair any common law or statutory cause of action, or legal remedy therefore, of any person for injury or damage arising from any violation of this section or from other law.

                  (a)  Investigation of nuisance property .

                  (b)  Filing of complaint . If the public officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may cause for the filing of a complaint in rem in the municipal court of the city against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before the municipal court at a date and time certain and at a place within the county or municipality where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing.

Copies of the complaint and summons shall also be mailed by first-class mail to the property address to the attention of the occupants, if any. For interested parties whose mailing address is unknown, a notice stating the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements appear in such county once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the hearing; and 
                  (3)  Lis pendens . A notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court in which the dwelling, building, structure, or property is located at the time of filing the complaint in municipal court. 
                  (4)  Affidavit of service . The public officer shall cause for an affidavit of service to be filed of record in the municipal court prior to the hearing showing compliance with the service requirements of this section.

                  (5)  Subsequent notices . Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this section on every interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings. 
                  (d)  Determination by court . If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, chapter 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (e)  Duty to comply with order . If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (f)  Stay of time for abatement . Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence. 
                  (g)  Salvage . If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (h)  Lien . The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. The lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in Fulton County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under this chapter. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within 90 days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the city and appropriate parties for collection and enforcement purposes. 
                  (i)  Enforcement of lien . It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The applicable authority may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the city. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the city from foreclosing on a lien filed pursuant to this chapter in lieu and/or in addition to collecting on the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes. 
                  (j)  Alternative collection and enforcement . The city may initiate its own collection and enforcement efforts and/or may waive and release any such lien imposed on property by agreement with the property owner(s) and/or interested parties. 
                  (k)  Appeal . Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by appeal to the superior court as provided by law.

                  Sec. 6-4009. - Limitation of liability for code enforcement; no special duty created. 
                  It is the intent of this chapter to protect the public health, life safety and general welfare of properties and occupiers of buildings and structures within the city in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. Approval of a permit and inspection of a property shall in no manner guarantee or warrant to the owner or occupants thereof that said property has been constructed, maintained, or operated in conformance with applicable codes, laws and regulations. The city reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any federal or state law, regulation, or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professional(s), and contractor(s) to satisfy such legal requirements.

                  Sec. 11-5005. - Cost assessments. 
                  The parks and recreation director or his or her designee shall send copies of special event applications to affected departments. Each departmental activity required for the special event shall be itemized, showing hourly rate and total cost. Costs shall only reflect those activities related to management of street use. The total street management costs to the city shall be the sum of each department's costs. The department of parks and recreation shall determine and calculate the fee accordingly. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-025, § 1, 5-21-18) 
                  Sec. 11-5006. - Performance or special events costs. 
                  (a)  Performance deposit . A performance deposit of 150 percent of the total estimated costs of the special event to the city shall be remitted to the city before the special event permit is issued. This requirement may be waived by the parks and recreation director or his or her designee if he or she determines, based on specific factual findings, that the performance deposit would be unduly burdensome or unnecessary given the size of the event or past history. 
                  (b)  Insurance . At the city's request, the applicant may be required to obtain and present evidence of a surety indemnity bond or comprehensive liability insurance naming the city as an additional insured. The insurance requirement is a minimum of $1,000,000.00 personal injury per occurrence and $500,000.00 property damage per occurrence against all claims arising from permits issued pursuant to this chapter. If the event poses higher risks than covered by such insurance, the applicant shall be responsible for assessing the risks of the event and obtaining additional insurance coverage. 
                  (c)  Save harmless agreement . The applicant is required to provide a save harmless agreement in which the applicant agrees to defend, pay and save harmless the city, its officers and employees, from any and all claims or lawsuits for personal injury or property damage arising from or in any way connected to the special event; excepting any claims arising solely out of the negligent acts of the city, its officers and employees. 
                  (d)  Cleanup . A special event permit may be issued only after adequate waste disposal facilities including, where necessary, portable toilets, have been identified and obtained by the applicant. The applicant will clean the right-of-way or public property of rubbish and debris, returning it to its pre-event condition, within 24 hours of the conclusion of the event. If the applicant fails to clean up such refuse within 24 hours of the conclusion of the event, such cleanup shall be arranged by the city and the city may retain a portion or all of the performance deposit and apply such funds to cover costs incurred by the city for cleanup ("cleanup costs"). Should the performance deposit fail to cover all cleanup costs, the city may charge the applicant for the remainder of such cleanup costs. 
                  (1)  Failure to pay outstanding cleanup costs. Failure to pay any outstanding cleanup costs incurred by the city after an applicants' special event shall prevent the city from issuing subsequent special permits to the applicant until all cleanup costs have been paid. 
                  (e)  Bond waiver . Upon written request and submittal of appropriate documentation, the parks and recreation director or his or her designee may waive the bond requirement if he determines that such fee is overly burdensome, unlawfully burdens speech or does not promote the general welfare of the city. This subsection may be appealed to the city municipal court. 
                  (f)  Immunities . 
                  (1)  This section shall not be construed as a waiver of any immunity to which the city is entitled. 
                  (2)  This chapter shall not be construed as imposing upon the city or its officials or employees any liability or responsibility for any injury or damage to any person in any way connected to the use for which permit has been issued. The city and its officials and employees shall not be deemed to have assumed any liability or responsibility by reasons of inspections performed, the issuance of any permit or the approval of any use of the right-of-way or other public property.

Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
                  (b)  Findings and rationale.

                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects. 
                  (2)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this chapter, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this chapter are reasonably believed to be relevant to the secondary effects. 
                  (c)  Adoption of findings of secondary effects. The city adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

An applicant for a sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee license shall file in person at the office of the city manager or his or her designee a completed application made on a form provided by the city manager or designee.

                  The information provided pursuant to this subsection (c) of this section shall be supplemented in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the city manager or designee within ten working days of a change of circumstances which would render the information originally submitted false or incomplete.

                  Sec. 12-1004. - Issuance of license. 
                  (a)  Business license. Upon the filing of a completed application for a sexually oriented business license, the city manager shall immediately issue a temporary license to the applicant if the completed application is from a preexisting sexually oriented business that is lawfully operating in the city and the completed application, on its face, indicates that the applicant is entitled to an annual sexually oriented business license. The temporary license shall expire upon the final decision of the city to deny or grant an annual license. Within 30 days of the filing of a completed sexually oriented business license application, the city manager shall either issue a license to the applicant or issue a written notice of intent to deny a license to the applicant. The city manager shall issue a license unless: 
                  (1)  An applicant is less than 18 years of age. 
                  (2)  An applicant has failed to provide information required by this chapter for issuance of a license or has falsely answered a question or request for information on the application form.

However, this ground for denial of a license to operate a sexually oriented business shall not prevent issuance or renewal of a license for a sexually oriented business that was in a location where a sexually oriented business was allowed under law prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, provided that the sexually oriented business has not been discontinued for a continuous period of six months; has not been enlarged; expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner that increases the degree of nonconformity; and has not had its structure destroyed to an extent exceeding 60 percent of the structure's fair market value at the time of destruction. 
                  (6)  Any sexually oriented business in which an applicant has had an influential interest, has, in the previous five years (and at a time during which the applicant had the influential interest): 
                  a.  Been declared by a court of law to be a nuisance; or 
                  b.  Been subject to an order of closure. 
                  (7)  An applicant has been convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to a specified criminal activity, as defined in this chapter. 
                  (b)  Employee license. The city manager or designee shall issue a license unless: 
                  (1)  The applicant is less than 18 years of age. 
                  (2)  The applicant has failed to provide information as required by this chapter for issuance of a license or has falsely answered a question or request for information on the application form. 
                  (3)  The license application fee required by this chapter has not been paid. 
                  (4)  Any sexually oriented business in which the applicant has had an influential interest, has, in the previous five years (and at a time during which the applicant had the influential interest): 
                  a.  Been declared by a court of law to be a nuisance; or 
                  b.  Been subject to an order of closure. 
                  (5)  The applicant has been convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to a specified criminal activity, as defined in this chapter. 
                  (c)  License information. The license, if granted, shall state on its face the name of the person or persons to whom it is granted, the number of the license issued to the licensees, the expiration date, and, if the license is for a sexually oriented business, the address of the sexually oriented business. The sexually oriented business license shall be posted in a conspicuous place at or near the entrance to the sexually oriented business so that it may be read at any time that the business is occupied by patrons or is open to the public. A sexually oriented business employee shall keep the employee's license on his person or on the premises where the licensee is then working or performing. 
                  (d)  Location requirements. A license granted under this section does not excuse compliance with, or authorize the violation of, any location or zoning requirements for sexually oriented businesses in effect in the city.

These inspections may occur at any time during a sexually oriented business' normal hours of operation without an appointment. This section shall be narrowly construed by the city to authorize reasonable inspections of the licensed premises pursuant to this chapter, but not to authorize a harassing or excessive pattern of inspections.

                  (b)  The city manager shall issue a written notice of intent to revoke a sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee license, as applicable, if: 
                  (1)  The licensee has knowingly given false information in the application for the sexually oriented business license or the sexually oriented business employee license; 
                  (2)  The licensee has knowingly or recklessly engaged in or allowed possession, use, or sale of controlled substances on the premises of the sexually oriented business;

                  (c)  The fact that any relevant conviction is being appealed shall have no effect on the revocation of the license, provided that, if any conviction which serves as a basis of a license revocation is overturned or reversed on appeal, that conviction shall be treated as null and of no effect for revocation purposes. 
                  (d)  When, after the notice and hearing procedure described in this chapter, the city revokes a license, the revocation shall continue for one year and the licensee shall not be issued a sexually oriented business license or sexually oriented business employee license for one year from the date revocation becomes effective.

                  Sec. 15-6001. - Short title. 
                  This code section shall be known and may be cited as the "City of South Fulton Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-005, § 1, 2-13-2018; Ord. No. 2018-004, § 1, 3-1-2018) 
                  Sec. 15-6002. - Legislative intent. 
                  (a)  The mayor and city council find and declare that it is the right of every person to be secure and protected from fear, intimidation, and physical harm caused by the activities of violent groups and individuals. It is not the intent of this chapter to interfere with the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and association. The mayor and city council recognize the constitutional right of every citizen to harbor and express beliefs on any lawful subject whatsoever, to associate lawfully with others who share similar beliefs, to petition lawfully constituted authority for a redress of perceived grievances, and to participate in the electoral process. 
                  (b)  The mayor and city council, however, further find that the City of South Fulton can be adversely affected by criminal street gangs whose members threaten, terrorize, and commit crimes against the peaceful citizens of their neighborhoods. These activities, both individually and collectively, present a clear and present danger to public order and safety. Such actions are not constitutionally protected. 
                  (c)  The mayor and city council find that there are criminal street gangs operating in the City of South Fulton. It is the intent of the mayor and city council in enacting this code section to seek the eradication of criminal activity by street gangs by focusing upon patterns of criminal gang activity and upon the organized nature of street gangs which together are the chief source of terror created by street gangs. 
                  (d)  The mayor and city council further find that an effective means of punishing and deterring the criminal activities of street gangs is through forfeiture of the profits, proceeds, and instrumentalities acquired, accumulated, or used by street gangs.

                  Be it ordained by the governing authority of the City that the authority, right, permission, and consent are hereby granted to the Company, for a period of 35 years from the date of the Company's acceptance hereof, to occupy and use the streets, alleys, and public places of the City within the present and future corporate limits of the City as from time to time the Company may deem proper or necessary for the overhead or underground construction, maintenance, operation, and extension of poles, towers, lines, wires, cables, conduits, insulators, transformers, appliances, equipment, connections, and other apparatus (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Company's Facilities") for the business and purpose of transmitting, conveying, conducting, using, supplying, and distributing electricity for light, heat, power, and other purposes for which electric current may be or become useful or practicable for public or private use, and to re-enter upon such streets, alleys, and public places from time to time as the Company may deem proper or necessary to perform these functions, and to cut and trim trees and shrubbery when and where necessary, in the judgment of the Company, to ensure safe and efficient service. 
                  Sec. II. - [Considerations, terms and conditions.] 
                  Be it further ordained that the rights, permission, and consents herein contained are granted for the following considerations and upon the following terms and conditions: 
                  1.  The Company shall pay into the treasury of the City:

                  2.  The amount, if any, of any tax, fee, charge, or imposition of any kind required, demanded, or exacted by the City on any account, other than ad valorem taxes on property, shall operate to reduce to that extent the amount due from the percentage of gross sales provided for in paragraph 1 of this Section II. 
                  3.  The Company shall fully protect, indemnify, and save harmless the City from all damages to persons or property caused by the construction, maintenance, operation, or extension of the Company's Facilities, or conditions of streets, alleys, or public places resulting therefrom, for which the City would otherwise be liable. 
                  4.  The Company shall, in constructing, maintaining, operating, and extending the Company's Facilities, submit and be subject to all reasonable exercises of the police power by the City.

Distribution Facilities do not include any of the following: 
                  (i)  Electric transmission lines with a design operating voltage of 46 kilovolts or greater (hereinafter referred to as "Transmission Lines");

                  (v)  Network underground facilities.

The Company's obligations under this paragraph 6 shall apply without regard to whether the Company has acquired, or claims to have acquired, an easement or other property right with respect to such Distribution Facilities and shall not affect the amounts paid or to be paid to the City under the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section II. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 6, the Company shall not be obligated to relocate, at its expense, any of the following:

In addition, the City and the Company shall communicate in a timely fashion to coordinate projects included in the City's five-year capital improvement plan, the City's short-term work program, or the City's annual budget in an effort to minimize relocation of the Company's Facilities. Such communication may include, but is not limited to: 
                  (i)  Both parties' participation in the Georgia Utilities Coordinating Council, Inc. (or any successor organization) or a local utilities coordinating council (or any successor organization); and 
                  (ii)  Both parties' use of the National Joint Utility Notification System (or any successor to such system mutually acceptable to both parties). 
                  8.  With regard to each streetscape project undertaken by or on behalf of the City, the City shall pay the Company in advance for the Company's estimated cost to relocate any of the Company's Facilities (whether Distribution Facilities, Transmission Lines, Transmission Structures, or other facilities) in connection with such project. For each streetscape project, the Company shall estimate in good faith the amount of incremental base revenue, if any, that the Company will realize as a result of new customer load or expansion of existing customer load attributable to such project; and such estimate shall be based on tariffs in effect at the time that construction of such project begins and shall not include fuel recovery charges, non-electric service billings, or taxes. If such estimate indicates that the Company will realize incremental base revenue, the Company shall do one of the following, whichever results in greater cost savings to the City: 
                  (i)  Reduce the City's advance payment to the Company for relocation costs by ten percent; or 
                  (ii)  Where the City has developed a bona fide marketing plan within 12 months after construction of such project begins, either refund the amount of the Company's incremental base revenue during such 12-month period to the City or credit such amount against any future payment due from the City to the Company. 
                  The City and the Company acknowledge and agree that the amount of any refund or credit calculated pursuant to clause (ii) of the foregoing sentence of this paragraph 8 shall not exceed the amount of the City's advance payment to the Company for relocation costs associated with such project. 
                  Sec. III. - [Customers' right.] 
                  Be it further ordained that nothing contained in this ordinance shall limit or restrict the right of customers within the corporate limits of the City to select an electric supplier as may hereafter be provided by law. 
                  Sec. IV. - [Additional agreements.] 
                  Be it further ordained that from time to time after the approval of this ordinance, the Company and the City may enter into such additional agreements as the Company and the City deem reasonable and appropriate; provided, however, that such agreements shall not be inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the franchise granted in this ordinance, shall not extend beyond the term of the franchise, and shall be enforceable separate and apart from the franchise. 
                  Sec. V. - [Acceptance; contract.] 
                  Be it further ordained that the Company shall, within 90 days from the approval of this ordinance, file the Company's written acceptance of the franchise granted in this ordinance with the Clerk of the City, so as to form a contract between the Company and the City. 
                  Sec. VI. - [Upon acceptance, conflicting agreements, ordinances, etc. deemed repealed.] 
                  Be it further ordained that upon such acceptance, all laws and ordinances, and all agreements between the Company and the City with respect to the Company's use of the City's streets, alleys, and public places, in actual conflict herewith be and the same shall thereupon stand repealed and terminated, respectively.
