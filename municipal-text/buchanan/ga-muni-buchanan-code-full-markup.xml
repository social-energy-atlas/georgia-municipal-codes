PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Buchanan, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were ordinances adopted by the city council through October 14, 2008. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Ramona Connors, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Karen Bates King, City Clerk, and Robert T. Monroe, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

The information shall be entered directly into the city's records system and held in a secure storage area with access limited to those city personnel with the need to know. 
                  (b)  For each customer account for which the city may now or hereafter provide individual customer access to the customer's account information, such account shall be assigned an account number and personal identification number (PIN) which shall be unique to that account.

                  Sec. 2-265. - Customer information confidential; report of requests for access. 
                  Personal identifying information included in customer accounts is considered confidential and any request or demand that specifically asks for such information shall be immediately forwarded to the applicable department head or other person authorized by the city council to carry out the provisions of this article.

                  ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 

                  Sec. 20-20. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 10-2-2008, art. 1, § B) 
                  Sec. 20-21. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 10-2-2008, art. 1, § C) 
                  Sec. 20-22. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and storage of materials or equipment. 
                  Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before December 15, 1990 (the effective date of the initial FIRM for that community). 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before December 12, 1990 (the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community). 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or

                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. The term "freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. Mean sea level is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) , as corrected in 1929, means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after December 15, 1990 (the effective date of the initial FIRM), and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced after December 12, 1990 (the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community), and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after December 12, 1990 (the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community).

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development.

                  Substantial improvement. 
                  (1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. 
                  Note: The market value of the structure should be: 
                  a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  (2)  The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  (3)  For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  (4)  The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
                  a.  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  ARTICLE IV. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 20-80. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area. 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 20-81. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 20-80(4). All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH Zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 20-53(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles where base flood elevation data are available. 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of this subsection (3). 
                  (4)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 20-25 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 20-25, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 20-25, then the code enforcement officer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the provisions in subsection (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 20-80(4). All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed. 
                  (4)  The code enforcement officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the mayor and council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The code enforcement officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the mayor and council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  Any fire burning uncontrolled on any forested or cut-over brush land or grassland is declared to be a public nuisance by reason of its menace to life and property. Any person, firm, or corporation responsible either for the starting or for the existence of such fire is required to control or extinguish it immediately.

                  (a)  Except in urgent circumstances involving nuisances per se, where the public health and safety require an immediate hearing, or a summary abatement within the municipal court of the city, the inspector shall give written notice of any alleged nuisance within the city as follows:

                  (b)  The hearing shall be conducted at a time and in a manner provided for by the judge of the municipal court.

                  (d)  Upon the adjudication by the judge of the municipal court that a nuisance exists, and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the owner or the person in possession of the property has not abated the nuisance after the expiration of five days from the date of the adjudication by the judge of the municipal court, or five days after the date given by the judge for abatement, then the inspector may thereafter cause the nuisance to be abated and the objectionable conditions to be removed from the property. The inspector shall be authorized to charge the cost and expense thereof to the owner of or the person in possession.

                  Excessive and disturbing sound is a serious hazard to the public health and welfare, safety, and the quality of life.

People have a right to and should be ensured an environment free from excessive and disturbing sound that may jeopardize their health, safety, or welfare or degrade the quality of life. In order to ensure attractive residential and commercial areas, it is necessary that an audibly satisfying environment be maintained. The city is more likely to attract permanent residents and commercial enterprises if it improves and maintains appropriate noise quality and the residents will ultimately gain financial improvements and increases in their quality of life as a result of these regulations.

                  Sec. 30-89. - Purposes. 
                  The city council has determined that: 
                  (1)  Persons under the age of 17 years are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful activity and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime. 
                  (2)  There has been a significant breakdown in the supervision and guidance normally provided by parents for minors resulting in an increase in the crimes, substance abuse, and school dropout rates, juvenile pregnancy, and other illicit behavior. 
                  (3)  The city has an obligation to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other persons, for the enforcement of parental control over and responsibility for children, for the protection of the general public, and for the reduction of the incidence of juvenile criminal activities which are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances. 
                  (4)  A curfew for those under the age of 17 years will be in the interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare and will help attain the foregoing objectives and diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct on the citizens of the city and will promote the public good, safety and welfare. 
                  (5)  Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm and legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had demonstrated effectiveness in many cities. 
                  (6)  A curfew will increase parental responsibility for minors within their control and decrease minor delinquency.

                  (2)  Permanent detention facilities will not be required if the design professional can provide calculations and proof there are no roads, culverts, buildings, or other property that will be adversely impacted by the increased runoff leaving the site, and that the discharge does not directly flow into a major flood plain or into a creek system with known or suspected flooding problems. Future phases of development of the drainage basin must be considered in determining adverse effects. 
                  (3)  Stage-storage-discharge relationship calculations for detention facilities and their outlet structures shall constrain the detention facilities' outflow to the allowable flow (allowable) or less for the two-year storm event, the five-year storm event, the ten-year storm event, the 25-year storm event, the 50-year storm event, and the 100-year storm event. The allowable for each storm event shall be determined by the following formula: 
                  Predevelopment + Offsite -Bypass = Allowable 
                  Where: 
                  Allowable = Maximum outlet flow allowed from the detention facility. 
                  Predevelopment = Flow from the site in an undeveloped state. 
                  Offsite = Flow onto the site from other site(s).

                  (a)  Use of this document. 
                  (1)  This document is subject to periodic revision to meet changing requirements for materials, environmental regulations, etc. At the beginning of a project the user should verify that he has the latest edition. 
                  (2)  This document is intended to convey the general design and construction requirements for a typical project. It also lists specific city requirements relating to plan review, inspection testing and acceptance of facilities. It is not intended as a substitute for site-specific engineering and construction techniques. 
                  (b)  Connection to existing sewers. 
                  (1)  Except as provided below, all future buildings within the city's corporate limits which are to be utilized for occupancy or any other use such as commercial or industrial purposes which requires sanitary sewerage facilities shall be connected to the public sewer system. Cost of constructing the necessary facilities for connection to public sewers shall be at the expense of the developer. 
                  (2)  Waiver of the requirement to connect to public sewers will be considered on a case-by-case basis for non-subdivided, single-lot buildings when the nearest connection point to a public sewer is more than 200 feet from the property line, when such buildings are to be used for single-family dwelling or some other use where the wastewater loading is no more than that of a single-family dwelling. 
                  (3)  The city maintains the option of requiring developers of individual lots to construct main line extensions of up to 200 feet to avoid cutting pavement on existing streets for connections to the public sewer. 
                  (c)  Definition of sewer line terminology. 
                  (1)  "Building sewers" or "service laterals" are defined as those pipes used to convey wastewater from the building or portions of a building to a main sewer. The minimum diameter for a service lateral is four inches. These sewers are privately funded and owned. 
                  (2)  "Main sewers" are located in streets or dedicated easements. They are gravity piping systems used to collect sewage from one or more service laterals to other main sewers. Main sewers are a minimum of eight inches in diameter and may extend beyond the property boundaries of a development. All payment for labor, materials, and other construction costs of main sewers is by the developer. 
                  (3)  "Force main sewers" are pressure piping systems which convey sewage from a pump station to a main sewer. These sewers are constructed of ductile iron pipe and have a minimum diameter of four inches. All funding of force mains is by the developer. 
                  (d)  When public sewers are not available. If sewers are not available within 200 feet of the property line the options available are: 
                  (1)  Do not develop. 
                  (2)  Install septic tanks or other on-site treatment system. 
                  (3)  Extend city sewers to the area development under such terms and agreements reached between the city and the developer. 
                  Sec. 44-88. - Plans, specifications and submittal. 
                  (a)  Generally. All projects which involve construction of main sewers and/or force mains and pumping facilities shall have detailed construction plans and specifications prepared by a registered professional engineer licensed in the state. Developments which only involve building sewers may have plans and specifications prepared by the project architect, and/or engineer. 
                  (b)  Preliminary review. Preliminary plans will be prepared and submitted for review as described elsewhere in the development regulations. Questions relating to availability of sewers and proposed location of connection should be resolved at this state before proceeding with final planning. A submittal for preliminary review must include all land to be developed although the land is to be developed in several phases or units. Availability determinations will be made only for the phases of the project proposed for current construction. Availability determinations will be valid for a period of one year from the date of project approval. The developer must submit any data required for accurately projecting sewer flow quantities and rates. The developer is also responsible for furnishing any other information deemed necessary for evaluating service feasibility. 
                  (c)  Sewer construction plans. All plans for public sewer facilities shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined herein and as required in regulations promulgated by the state environment protection division. The developer shall be responsible for submitting plans and other data to the Georgia EPD for required approvals. Projects involving sewers greater than 36 inches in diameter or pump stations with capacity of 700 gallons per minute and greater must be submitted to EPD for required approvals. The following requirements will apply to preparation of sewer construction plans: 
                  (1)  The site plan shall show land lots, district and north arrow, lot layout, and existing and proposed building locations. The site plan shall also show all existing and proposed streets and their names, all streams, watercourses, existing and proposed storm drains, and the discharge points for all drainage structures.

                  (2)  The design of cross-country sewer lines and force mains shall be based on field-run surveys. The site plan for cross-country sewer lines and force mains need not show contour intervals on the plan view, but the profile views shall accurately depict ground level elevations of all relevant structures. Site plans for lift stations shall show existing and proposed contours. In the event the subdivision is developed in phases, the final construction plans for sewers may be submitted in phases or units. However, at the time first phase is submitted, the engineer will submit one copy of the preliminary layout of the entire sewer system. This layout will show all lines required to serve any lots to be developed and any surrounding property that may be served through the property. The site plans for each phase or unit shall contain a location drawing showing the relationship of the phase or unit to the total project and to the surrounding streets and sewers. 
                  (3)  Profiles should have a horizontal scale of not more than 100 feet to the inch for cross-country lines and 50 feet to the inch for congested areas, and a vertical scale of not more than ten feet to the inch. The plan view should be shown on the same sheet as the profile. In any case both the plan and profile view should have line designations, station numbers, manhole numbers, and any other indexing necessary to easily correlate the plan and profile view. Plans and profiles shall show: 
                  a.  Locations of streets, sewers, and utility easements. 
                  b.  Profile of ground surface, the grade of the sewer between each two adjacent manholes, size, and material of pipe, length between manholes, invert of sewer in and out of each manhole, and ground surface elevation at each manhole.

                  (f)  As-built drawing. 
                  (1)  At the completion of construction (and preferably prior to the final field inspection), an "as-built" drawing of the project shall be submitted to the city to serve as a permanent record of the project and shall be furnished in the form of one set of Mylar sepias (or other suitable form of reproducible drawings) and two sets of blue line copies. Acceptance by the city will be made only after satisfactory as-built drawings have been submitted. As-built drawings will be in the same format as the original construction plans and normally will be an updated by the project design professional. Each sheet of these drawings shall bear words "As-Built" or "Record Drawings." 
                  (2)  Guidelines for preparation of as-builts. 
                  a.  As-built drawings will be same format as the original construction plans.

                  (g)  Easement acquisition and utility encroachment permits. 
                  (1)  It shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain any off-site easements required to connect the project to existing public sewers. Easements will be conveyed to the city for all facilities which are to be conveyed to the city. This process must be used until off-site sewers have been constructed and accepted. This condition shall override any provision for speed up of house starts such as furnishing a bond to guarantee completion of the street or other appurtenances. 
                  (2)  All easements shall allow adequate room to construct the sewer and appurtenances. Permanent easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide, ten feet on each side of the line; except that when the depth of the sewer exceeds ten feet the required sewer easement width shall increase such that the easement width is at least twice the depth from the ground surface to bottom of the pipe. Designs involving utilities sharing a common easement will be coordinated with the utilities to insure adequate separation of utilities and overall easement width is achieved. 
                  (3)  Easement drawings for work outside the development shall be furnished and recorded prior to approval of the sewer plans. 
                  1.  The drawings shall be of size suitable for legal recording and shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor. The drawing will show property lines, the name of property owners with the length of line encroaching on each property owner, size of line, line designation, manhole numbers, and stations, width of permanent and construction easement, scale of drawing, north arrow land lot and district numbers, and a tie to the nearest land lot corner. Any streets or other existing easements shall also be shown. 
                  2.  The title block shall be shown as follows: 
                  City of Buchanan

                  LL: District: Section: Date: Revised Date: 
                  3.  New sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than 400 gallons per household per day. Normally, all sewers shall be designed for a peak flow of not less than 2½ times the average flow; this peak factor will be higher in smaller basins (see design guides). Sewers should be designed to carry the peak flow at a depth of two-thirds pipe diameter. 
                  4.  The city land use plan should be consulted and special consideration given to commercial and industrial areas. Where developers are installing major trunk lines or interceptor sewers, the city's long range plan should be consulted as a guide and the sewer should (as a minimum) be of the size called for in the long range plan. If proposed land use conditions have subsequent to the plan, these changes should be factored into the determination. 
                  (4)  The engineer shall furnish all appropriate drawings for submittal of any state and federal highways, railroads, power lines, water lines, gas lines, petroleum lines, or any other utility lines on which the sewer construction will encroach. The drawing shall normally be 8½ inches by 11 inches or 8½ inches by 14 inches and shall show a plan view and profile view. The drawing will show the same information required for easement drawings. Also, the drawing will show the right-of-way of the existing street or utility, the owner's designation of the line, the name of the nearest intersection or mile post or tower number and the distance to that appurtenance. The clearance distance between the street surface or the bottom of the rail, or the utility and the sewer will be shown. The drawing will also contain any other special information required by the controlling authority of the facility on which the sewer is encroaching. A minimum of five copies of the utility encroachment drawing will be furnished with the plans when they are submitted for approval. The engineer is also responsible for furnishing a completed encroachment permit application if required ready for signature. Construction permits will not be issued until the utility encroachment permit has been obtained and until any special conditions such as insurance requirements have been met. 
                  Sec. 44-89. - Design criteria and materials for sewers. 
                  (a)  Generally. The criteria listed herein is not intended to cover all aspects of design, but rather to mention the basic guidelines and those particulars that are required by the city water department. For more detailed criteria, the reader should refer to standard references such as "Ten States Standards," Georgia EPD rules, Water Pollution Environment Federation Manual of Practice NO. FD-5, and other available literature. 
                  (b)  Types of sewers. All sewers for the conveyance of wastewater shall be designed as separate sanitary sewers in which groundwater, stormwater or other runoff from roofs, street, parking lots, foundation drains and any source other than wastewater are excluded. Overflows from sewers shall not be permitted. 
                  (c)  Design period. Gravity sewer pipelines should, as a minimum, be designed with capacity sufficient to handle the estimated tributary population. Tributary population is considered to be all areas upstream of the discharge point of the system being designed as well as any anticipated pumped flow from other basins. Sewers will be designed and installed to the uppermost property line of the development being served. Consideration should be given to the maximum anticipated capacity of institutions, industrial parts, etc. 
                  (d)  Capacity and size determinations. In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors should be considered: 
                  (1)  Maximum hourly sewage flow. 
                  (2)  Additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants. 
                  (3)  Ground water infiltration. 
                  (4)  Topography of the area. 
                  (5)  Depth of excavation. 
                  (e)  As-builts. 
                  (1)  As-built drawings will be same format as the original construction plans. 
                  (2)  Road names and lot numbers should be on plans. 
                  (3)  As-builts or record drawing is to be stamped in large clear print on plans.

                  (5)  Water mains and meters should be shown, including size and types. 
                  (6)  Service and meter locations should be shown. 
                  (7)  Include detail drawings showing size, type, configuration, and location of fittings. 
                  (8)  Include detail drawings depicting the configuration of crossings with indicating vertical and horizontal clearances. 
                  (9)  Clearly indicate easement boundaries on all lines not located inside the public right-of-way. 
                  (10)  Fire hydrants, gate valves, and air release valves should be shown. 
                  (11)  Plan of fire meters or detector meters should be shown if applicable. 
                  (12)  As-built drawings must be submitted to the city and approved before the final plat is recorded. 
                  (f)  Special city requirements. 
                  (1)  Distance between manholes. Maximum distance between manholes shall be 400 feet. 
                  (2)  Depth. Any sewers installed in the street shall, topography permitting, be sufficient deep to provide five feet of cover over service laterals at the street right-of-way, and over any part of the main or service within the street right-of-way. The maximum depth for PVC pipe shall be 15 feet, depths in excess of this shall be ductile iron. Sewers installed in streets shall have maximum depth of 12 feet. Any sewers on off street easements shall have a minimum of three feet of cover unless ductile iron pipe is used. Filling over the pipe to obtain minimum cover is not allowed. 
                  (3)  Drop across manholes. All manholes shall be provided with a minimum vertical drop across the manhole (between in and out pipe) of 0.10 feet. 
                  (4)  Detection tape shall be installed over all sewer pipes. Bury tape 18 to 24 inches below grade. Use detection wire on all service laterals. 
                  (g)  Slope. All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two feet per second based on Manning's formula using an "n" value of 0.013. The following are in the minimum slopes which should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable: 
                  (1)  Minimum slope in feet: 

                   
                  (2)  These minimum slopes will be used only when sufficient flows are expected to maintain a velocity of two feet per second and maintain a cleaning action in the line. Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on 20 percent slope or greater shall be ductile iron pipe and shall anchored securely with concrete anchors (see section 44-60) to prevent displacement by erosion or shock. Maximum slope of sewers shall be 30 percent and sewers shall be designed at less than 20 percent whenever possible. 
                  (h)  Increasing size. When a small sewer is connected to a large one, the connection shall not be lower than matching the top of both sewers to the same elevation. 
                  (i)  Gravity sewer pipe materials. 
                  (1)  The city reserves the right to disallow any manufacturer that does not have a consistent, long-term record of quality control and successful project performance. Gravity sanitary sewer pipe up through 151-inch diameter will normally be polyvinyl chloride (PVC); solid wall type SDR 35 thickness meeting ASTM D3034 ductile iron pipe (DIP) will be used where certain conditions exist (see discussion of DIP). For 18-inch diameter pipe and above, the contractor may have the option of using either polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or ductile iron pipe. The city may approve other types of pipe on a case basis and may limit the options of type of pipe depending on site conditions. This should be addressed at the preliminary review stage. 
                  (2)  Bedding for sewer pipe shall be as follows (also see city standard details): 
                  a.  For PVC the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe extending up to six inches above top of pipe for the full width of the trench. 
                  b.  For concrete and ductile iron pipe the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe extending up to the top of the pipe. 
                  c.  In wet areas, the minimum bedding requirements will be increased as required to ensure a stable support under the pipe and on the sides of the pipe. 
                  (3)  Ductile iron pipe (DIP). 
                  a.  Scope. Ductile iron sewer pipe shall be required at all utility crossings with less than two feet of clearance, in locations where cover is les than three feet, at stream crossings, where slopes exceed 20 percent, and where cover exceeds 15 feet.

                  (4)  Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe. 
                  a.  Scope. The contractor shall provide unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic gravity sewer pipe meeting the requirements of ASTM D3034 (latest revision) in the sizes shown unless otherwise indicated on the contract documents. 
                  b.  Materials. Pipe and fittings shall meet the requirements as specified under ASTM D3034 (latest revision) for pipe through 15 inches and ADTM F679 for pipe 18 inches through 27 inches. All pipe and fitting shall be suitable for use as elastomeric gasket joint which provides a watertight seal. The pipe shall be capable of passing all tests which are detailed in this specification. Minimum wall thickness shall be SDR 23. 
                  c.  Fittings. All fittings and accessories shall be manufactured and furnished by the pipe supplier. They shall have bell and/or spigot configurations compatible with that of the pipe and shall have an equivalent thickness. 
                  d.  Pipe and fittings tests. Before shipping any pipe, the manufacturer shall submit shop drawings to the city and shall furnish written certification that all pipes through 15 inches meets ASTM Specifications D3034 and that pipe 18 inches through 24 inches meets ASTM F679. The city reserves the right to require additional laboratory testing at the developer's expense to verify minimum quality standards are being met. 
                  e.  Pipe stiffness. Minimum "pipe stiffness" (F/Y) at five percent deflection shall be 46 psi for all sizes, when tested in accordance with ASTM Standard Method of Test D2412 (latest edition), to determine the "External Loading Properties of Plastic Pipe by Parallel-Plate Loading."

                  (2)  The diameter of the bore shall conform to the outside diameter and circumference of the casing pipe as closely as practicable. Any voids which develop during the installation operation shall be pressure grouted. Each segment of the casing pipe shall be welded (full circumference butt weld) to the adjoining segment. The completed casing shall have no sags or crowns which cause the grade for any segment to be less than the minimum slope for the size pipe being installed. 
                  (3)  The carrier pipe shall be fitted with approved spacers to secure its position within the casing. At each end of the casing pipe the void between the carrier pipe and casing shall be sealed with brick and mortar. 
                  (k)  Replacement of pavement. Contractor shall fully restore and replace all pavement, curbs, gutters, sidewalks and other surface structures removed or disturbed, to a condition that is equal to or better than the original condition in a manner satisfactory to the city. (See section 44-64.) 
                  (l)  Location/protection of existing underground utilities. It is the responsibility of the contractor to locate all underground utilities and to protect same. Utility lines or services damaged by the contractor shall be repaired by the contractor at the contractor's expense. The contractor has sole responsibility of complying with all provisions of all federal, state, and local codes. 
                  (m)  Protection of water supply and other utilities. 
                  (1)  The city has an established cross-connection program (3/6/1986) to prevent the entry of contaminants or pollutants into any area of the potable water supply by use of cross connection and/or check valve system. No party may introduce any substance into or to have any cross-connection with the potable water supply. There shall be no physical connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sanitary sewer which would permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable water supply of the city. 
                  (2)  Whenever possible, sewers should be laid at least ten feet horizontally from any existing or proposed water main. Should conditions prevent a separation of ten feet, the lines shall be laid in separate trenches. 
                  (n)  Sewer services. 
                  (1)  A sewer service shall be provided for every existing or proposed lot or building. All sewer services shall be a minimum of four inches in diameter unless otherwise specified. All service lines shall be designed to maintain a minimum of two ft./sec. sewer velocity. All services shall be shown on the construction and as-built drawings. A common service shall not be allowed for two or more buildings. The service shall extend to five feet inside the property line of the lost being served and normally be within ten feet of the property line. Where five feet of cover cannot be achieved, sewer services shall be constructed of ductile iron. A 90 degree bend, constructed from two 45 degree fittings shall be installed at the end of all sewer services with a vertical section of pipe to extend a minimum four feet above existing ground level (see section 44-64). Connections to the main exceeding eight feet in depth may have the saddle or tee rotated to a bend inserted in the service to provide five feet lateral depth at the property line. 
                  (2)  The developer shall be responsible for serving all lots developed. On any lot where the service cannot be found, the developer shall be responsible for payment of the cost of installation of the service. Also, unless noted on the final plat, the service shall be low enough to serve the first floor elevation at the building line. 
                  (3)  A backflow preventer shall be placed on each lateral just outside foundation. 
                  (4)  A 14 gauge detector wire shall be installed above each service lateral from the sewer line to the end of the service lateral. The wire should be installed at a minimum depth of 12 inches. 
                  (5)  The builder shall be responsible for the location of the service prior to the pouring of the foundation, driveway, or other appurtenance. The city will not be responsible for any house built too low to be served nor for any service covered by construction. 
                  (6)  No plumber or contractor will be allowed to connect to the sewage system except to the end of the service provided for his connection. Also, any service provided will be utilized without the installation of additional services. 
                  (o)  Clean-up. 
                  (1)  Prior to requesting the "completion of sewer construction" inspection, the contractor shall remove and dispose of in an acceptable manner all shipping timbers, shipping bands, spacers, excess materials, broken material, crates, boxes and any other material brought to the job site. 
                  (2)  Any work areas within public right-of-way or property outside of the development that were damaged by the sewer construction shall be repaired or replaced with the same kind of material as existed prior to the damage occurring. All easement areas shall be cleared of trees, stumps, and other debris and left in a condition such that the easement can be maintained by bush hog equipment. 
                  (3)  All shoulders, ditches, culverts, and other areas impacted by the sewer construction shall be at the proper grades and smooth in appearance. 
                  (4)  All manhole covers shall be brought to grade. 
                  (5)  A uniform standard of grass or mulch for erosion protection, as defined in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, is required over all construction easement and sanitary sewer easements prior to the City's acceptance of the sewer. A grass mixture must consist of at least 50 percent fescue. 
                  Sec. 44-91. - Inspection of sewers. 
                  (a)  City inspection. 
                  (1)  The developer's contractor will be responsible for the quality, accuracy, and workmanship of his completed work. 
                  (2)  City personnel will visit the job site on a periodic basis and inspect the work. The city shall have the right to review and or inspect all construction and may reject any work that does not meet quality control standard policies, plans, and regulations applicable to the work. 
                  (b)  Access to project. Authorized representatives of the city, including city employees, city engineer, state or federal agencies shall have access to the site for inspection at any time. 
                  (c)  Communications during construction. 
                  (1)  A preconstruction conference will be required for all projects. The developer has sole responsibility for scheduling the conferences. The developer, design professional, contractor, and subcontractor(s) are required to meet with the city and all private utilities in the conference. The contractor will notify the city in writing 24 hours before starting construction. The contractor will provide notification by phone any time the work is to be vacated and will provide notice by phone prior to resuming work. The contractor shall request the final inspection. 
                  (2)  The city inspector may have informal verbal communication with the contractor foreman or superintendent at any time during construction. The city inspector will not direct the action's of the contractor's workmen. 
                  (d)  Concealed work. The city inspector may direct that the contractor notify the city and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as manhole foundations, pipe bedding, tees, bends, service laterals, or other appurtenances. 
                  (e)  Minimum inspection by developer. The following minimum information shall be determined and certified by the engineer: 
                  (1)  Horizontal location. Horizontal location of the line will be checked by measuring as-built distances between manholes and bearings from manhole to manhole. 
                  (2)  Elevation and slope. Elevation of each invert and top of manhole will be measured and recorded. Actual pipe slope will be computed; any segment having less than minimum allowable slope will be rejected and re-done. 
                  (f)  City inspection. Cost for all testing shall be paid by the developer. 
                  (1)  Manhole construction. Manholes will be visually inspected to check for plugging of lift holes, use of connecting boots, use of joint material, leakage, proper invert construction, and proper setting of frame and cover. 
                  (2)  Pipe straightness. Sections of sewer line will be visually checked for straightness. A passing section shall show at least 80 percent of a full circle when observed from one end. Any section which fails this visual test shall be further checked. This section shall have water run through it sufficient to fill any sags and a television camera pulled through the section to check for sags. Any sag holding more than 1½ inches of water will require that the pipe be removed and replaced to proper grade after which the section shall be televised again to verify correction. The contractor may propose alternative methods other than televising sewers for the city's approval to determine failing sections of sewers. 
                  (3)  Infiltration. The allowable limit for any section from manhole will be 100 gallons per day per inch of pipe diameter per mile of pipe. If any infiltration is present at the most downstream point, then it will be measured upstream manhole that has any visible flow of water. Any individual segment which exceeds the allowable infiltration shall be corrected to within allowable limits. 
                  (4)  Compaction of backfill. Compaction testing may be required for sewers constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of two tests per 50 feet of trench line located in roadways will be required. If any of these test show failing results, the failing backfill will be removed, re-compacted, and re-tested, and one additional area will be tested as well. 
                  (g)  Other testing requirements. The tests listed below shall be performed by the contractor in the presence of the city. The city will be notified at least two days prior to these tests. 
                  (1)  Mandrel test for PVC Pipe. Procedure for testing PVC sewer pipe for maximum allowable defection shall be generally as follows (Mandrel sized to 95 percent of the nominal internal pipe diameter): 
                  a.  Completely flush the line making sure the pipe is clean of any mud or trash that would hinder the passage of the mandrel. 
                  b.  During the final flushing of the line, attach a floating block or ball to the end of the mandrel pull rope and float the rope through the line. (A nylon ski rope is recommended.) 
                  c.  After the rope is threaded through the line, connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe. 
                  d.  Connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel. This will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered. 
                  e.  Draw the mandrel through the sewer line. 
                  f.  All increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection. If this occurs, mark the rope to note the location. Televise the sewer section to identify the extent of the problem and develop a plan, subject to city approval, for correcting the problem. The contractor may propose an alternative method other than televising sewers for the city's approval to determine location of failing sewers. 
                  g.  Retest. 
                  (2)  Air pressure test. A low pressure test of each sewer line section will be conducted by the contractor to check for leaks. The following general procedures will apply (also refer to ASTM specs): 
                  a.  Temporarily plug the line segment between two manholes using plugs having air tight fittings through which low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested. 
                  b.  Introduce low pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches 4.5 psig above ground water pressure if any. 
                  c.  Wait at least five minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains no less than 3.5 psig above ground water pressure. 
                  d.  Bleed internal air pressure to exactly 3.5 psig above ground water pressure. 
                  e.  Accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop to 2.5 psig above ground water pressure. 
                  f.  The air test is acceptable if elapsed time is no less that shown by the following chart: 

                   
                  1.  Air leakage time is based on pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen line if helpful in meeting air test time requirements. 
                  2.  Permanently correct excessive leakage determined by air testing, and repeat operations until city witnesses a successful test on each line segment. 
                  Note— Upon request, the city may allow substitution of exfiltration test in lieu of air pressure test. If used, exfiltration test will be conducted with a minimum water head of two feet above the groundwater table and the allowable exfiltration will be limited to 100 gallons per inch diameter of pipe per mile of pipe. 
                  (3)  Manhole testing. All manholes require testing be either the vacuum test or exfiltration test. 
                  a.  Exfiltration test. Manholes which have been backfilled around shall be tested for exfiltration. The minimum test time duration is one hour. Manholes shall be filled with water to the top of the ring. The maximum allowable exfiltration is two gal/ft. of manhole diameter. 
                  b.  Vacuum test. Vacuum testing of manholes for water tightness may be used in lieu of the exfiltration test prior to backfilling. After temporarily plugging pipe openings and installing the vacuum base on top of the cone, a vacuum of ten inches of mercury shall be drawn and the vacuum pump shut off. With valves closed, the pressure test shall be monitored for a period of 60 seconds. At the end of the test period, if the vacuum is nine inches or greater, it has passed; if the vacuum drops below nine inches, the manhole has failed. 
                  (h)  Final inspection and conditional acceptance. 
                  (1)  In no circumstances shall any building and plumbing fixtures be connected to a developed sewer system until the system is inspected and approved by the city. 
                  (2)  The contractor shall request a written final inspection, which will generally include spot checks of manholes and sewer lines and a complete overview of the project. 
                  (3)  After any discrepancies are corrected, the city will issue a letter certifying conditional acceptance of the sewer system. This letter shall commence the start of the 24-month warranty period which is required of the contractor. 
                  (4)  On projects having phased development, this letter allows the developer to apply for a permit for the next phase of development. 
                  (i)  Maintenance bond. The developer shall post a maintenance bond on the facility for a two year period after completion and conditional acceptance of the facility by the city. 
                  (j)  Maintenance until final acceptance. It shall be the developer's obligation to provide all maintenance for an 24-month period after conditional acceptance of the project by the city. At the end of the 24-month maintenance period the city shall inspect the sewer system and upon correction by the developer of all deficiencies noted by the city, the city will accept the sewer system for operation. 
                  (k)  At the end of the 24 months, the subdivision inspection team will again re-inspect the entire development. When all discrepancies have been corrected, the city will issue a final acceptance letter and will begin perpetual maintenance and operation of the sewage system.

                  (1)  All persons who wish to address the city council at a hearing concerning a proposed zoning decision under consideration by the city council shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the city prior to the commencement of the hearing. 
                  (2)  The zoning administrator will read the proposed zoning decision under consideration and the departmental review pertaining thereto prior to receiving public input on said proposed zoning decision. Proposed zoning decisions shall be called in the order in which they were filed. 
                  (3)  The zoning administrator shall then call each person who has signed up to speak on the zoning decision in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except the applicant who will always speak first. Prior to speaking, the speaker will identify himself and state his current address. Only those persons who signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless the city council, in its discretion, allows the person to speak to the zoning decision, notwithstanding the failure of the person to sign up prior to the hearing. 
                  (4)  Each speaker shall be allowed ten minutes to address the city council concerning the zoning decision then under consideration, unless the city council, prior to or at the time of the reading of the proposed zoning decision, votes to allow additional time in which to address the city council on said proposed zoning decision. The speaker may initially use all of the time allotted to him to speak or he may speak and reserve a portion of his allotted time for rebuttal. A member of the city council shall be designated as the time keeper to record the time expended by each speaker. 
                  (5)  Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed zoning decision under consideration and shall address his remarks only to the city council. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or the discussion of facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed zoning decision under consideration. The city council may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection. 
                  (6)  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the city council from conducting the hearing in an orderly and decorous manner to ensure that the public hearing on a proposed zoning decision is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.
