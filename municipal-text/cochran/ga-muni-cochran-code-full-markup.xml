PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Cochran, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1999 Code, as supplemented through December 21, 1999, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1999 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and K. Barrington, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Edward E. Towns, Mayor; Matt Turknett, City Clerk; Leo L. Phillips, Jr., City Attorney; and Betty Cooper, Secretary to the City Attorney; for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  Editor's note—The City of Cochran, Georgia, was first established by Ga. Laws. 1869 (Act No. 67), page 75. The city's Charter has been subsequently repealed, amended and reenacted on numerous occasions. Printed herein is the most recent Charter for the city as adopted and set forth in 2000 Ga. Laws (Act No. 620), page 4364. Amendments to this most recent Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision derives unchanged from the original Charter. Affidavits and notices of intent that accompanied the act have been omitted. A uniform system of headings, catchlines, numbering, punctuation and capitalization has been used. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation and material in brackets has been added for clarity.

                  The General Assembly determines and finds that there is a present and projected growth in commercial and private air traffic in the Bleckley County area. There is the need for adequate airports safely and efficiently to serve the air transportation needs of this state and Bleckley County, the need to eliminate airport hazards, and the need to raise capital for the establishment, operation, and maintenance of present and future airports.

                  (b)	Any project shall be deemed self-liquidating if, in the judgment of the authority, the revenues and earnings to be derived by the authority therefrom and all facilities used in connection therewith will be sufficient to pay the costs of operating, maintaining, repairing, improving, and extending the project and to pay the principal of and interest on the revenue bonds which may be issued to finance, in whole or in part, the cost of such project or projects. 
                  Sec. 5. - Powers. 
                  The authority shall have the power: 
                  (1)	To have a seal and alter the same at its pleasure;

Likewise, without limiting the generality of the above and foregoing, the same authority above granted to municipal corporations, counties, political subdivisions, and to the authority relative to entering into contracts, lease agreements, or other undertakings is authorized between the authority and private corporations, both inside and outside this state, and between the authority and public bodies, including counties and cities outside this state;

                  (11)	To do all things necessary or convenient to carry out the powers expressly given in this Act. 
                  Sec. 6. - Revenue bonds. 
                  The authority, or any authority or body which has or which may in the future succeed to the powers, duties, and liabilities vested in the authority created by this Act is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds of the authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost as herein defined of any one or more projects. The principal of and interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund provided in this Act for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates per annum, payable at such time or times, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority, and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution for the issuance of bonds. 
                  Sec. 7. - Revenue bonds; form, denomination; registration; place of payment. 
                  The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereon, which may be at any bank or trust company inside or outside the state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. 
                  Sec. 8. - Revenue bonds; signatures; seal. 
                  In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairperson of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary of the authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairperson and the secretary of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such person may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. 
                  Sec. 9. - Revenue bonds; negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
                  All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of this state. Such bonds, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation within this state. 
                  Sec. 10. - Revenue bonds; sale; price; proceeds. 
                  The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority. The proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose or purposes provided in the resolutions and proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds. 
                  Sec. 11. - Revenue bonds; interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
                  Prior to the preparation of any definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
                  Sec. 12. - Revenue bonds; replacement of lost or mutilated bonds. 
                  The authority may provide for the replacement of any bonds or coupons which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
                  Sec. 13. - Revenue bonds; conditions precedent to issuance. 
                  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified or required by this Act. In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
                  Sec. 14. - Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the City of Cochran or Bleckley County nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said city or county; but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate said city or county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. All such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
                  Sec. 15. - Trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company inside or outside the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
                  Sec. 16. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes of this Act, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
                  Sec. 17. - Sinking fund. 
                  The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust instrument may provide. Such funds so pledged from whatever source received, including funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund which shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of: 
                  (1)	The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due;
                  (2)	The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due;
                  (3)	The necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest and other investment charges; 
                  (4)	Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as provided in this Act; and
                  (5)	Any investment fees or charges.
                  The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust indenture, any surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds, and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued. 
                  Sec. 18. - Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights given in this Act may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of this state or granted under this Act or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
                  Sec. 19. - Refunding bonds. 
                  The authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of bonds of the authority for the purpose of funding or refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and premium, if any. The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this Act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
                  Sec. 20. - Validation. 
                  Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of article 3 of chapter 82 of title 36 of the O.C.G.A. [O.C.G.A. art. 3, tit. 36, ch. 82], known as the revenue bond law. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and the state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the contract or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis for the security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority issuing the same and the state and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the Cochran Municipal Airport Authority. 
                  Sec. 21. - Venue and jurisdiction. 
                  Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Bleckley County, Georgia; and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
                  Sec. 22. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
                  While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds. No other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
                  Sec. 23. - Moneys received considered trust funds. 
                  All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenue, income, fees, and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act. 
                  Sec. 24. - Purpose of the authority. 
                  Without limiting the generality of any provision of this Act, the general purpose of the authority is declared to be that of acquiring, constructing, equipping, maintaining, and operating an airport and the usual facilities related thereto, and improving of such facilities, acquiring parking facilities and parking areas in connection therewith, acquiring the necessary property therefor, both real and personal, and leasing or selling any or all of such facilities, including real property, and doing any and all things deemed by the authority to be necessary, convenient, or desirable for and incident to the efficient and proper development and operation of such types of undertaking. 
                  Sec. 25. - Rates, charges, and revenues; use.

                  The city council has found as follows: 
                  (1)	The city is a creditor pursuant to 16 CFR 681.2 due to its provision or maintenance of covered accounts for which payment is made in arrears. Covered accounts offered to customers for the provision of city services include water, sewer, solid waste, and stormwater. 
                  (2)	The processes of opening a new covered account, restoring an existing covered account, making payments on such accounts, and making payments for property taxes and other services have been identified as potential processes in which identity theft could occur. 
                  (3)	The city limits access to personal identifying information to those employees responsible for or otherwise involved in opening or restoring covered accounts or accepting payment for use of covered accounts. 
                  (4)	The city determines that there is a low risk of identity theft occurring in the following ways, if any:

                  d.	Use by a customer desiring to restore such customer's covered account of another person's credit card, bank account, or other method of payment. 
                  Sec. 2-506. - Process of establishing a covered account. 
                  (a)	As a precondition to opening a covered account with the city, each applicant shall provide the city with personal identifying information of the customer in the form of a valid government issued identification card containing a photograph of the customer or, for customers who are not natural persons, a photograph of the customer's agent opening the account with written confirmation of being the authorized agent for the entity. The applicant shall also provide any other information necessary for the department providing the service for which the covered account is created. The information shall be entered directly into the city's records system and held in a secure storage area with access limited to those city personnel with the need to know. 
                  (b)	For each customer account for which the city may now or hereafter provide individual customer access to the customer's account information, such account shall be assigned an account number and personal identification number (PIN) which shall be unique to that account.

                  Sec. 2-508. - Report of unauthorized access. 
                  Any unauthorized access to or other breach of customer accounts is to be reported immediately to the appropriate department head and the password changed immediately. 
                  Sec. 2-509. - Customer information confidential; report of requests for access. 
                  Personal identifying information included in customer accounts is considered confidential and any request or demand that specifically asks for such information shall be immediately forwarded to the applicable department head or other person authorized by the city council to carry out the provisions of this article.

                  (a)	In the event that credit card payments that are made over the internet are processed through a third-party service provider, such third-party service provider shall certify that it has an adequate identity theft prevention program in place that is applicable to such payments.

                  ARTICLE VII. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 

                  Sec. 4-381. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)	Based on the demonstrated experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to: Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Orlando, Florida; Orange County, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Los Angeles, California; Beaumont, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Austin, Texas, which experience is found to be relevant to the problems that face the city, the mayor and council of the city take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country, particularly the problems of crime, blight, and deterioration which are brought about by alcohol and live nudity. 
                  (b)	It is the finding of the mayor and council of the city that public nudity (either partial or total) under circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called nude bars or establishments offering so-called nude entertainment or adult entertainment in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. 
                  (c)	Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public indecency and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the concentration of adult entertainment establishments are depreciation of property values in neighborhoods surrounding nude bars or adult entertainment establishments where alcoholic beverages are sold, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burdens on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of adult establishments in particular areas. 
                  (d)	Other negative effects which were found by the mayor and council are the apparent connection of these establishments to organized crime and illegal drug sales; the potential spread of communicable diseases to law enforcement personnel who answer calls at adult establishments and to patrons of such establishments; and the potential proliferation of adult entertainment establishments after the initial siting of an adult entertainment establishment in a particular neighborhood. 
                  (e)	The city, therefore, finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety, and morals and preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, and parks to prevent the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the city finds that the prohibition of live nude conduct in establishments licensed to serve alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare by furthering legitimate government interests, such as reducing criminal activity, protection against property devaluation and deterioration, and eliminating undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and allow and/or encourage nudity, and that such prohibition will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech. To that end, this section is hereby adopted. 
                  Sec. 4-382. - Conduct prohibited; exception. 
                  The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve or dispense alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises within the city: 
                  (1)	The employment or use of any person live, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages or food while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing, as to expose any portion of his specified anatomical areas. 
                  (2)	Live entertainment where any person appears unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose any portion of his specified anatomical areas or where such person performs acts of specified sexual activities or acts which simulate specified sexual activity. 
                  (3)	The holding, promotion, sponsoring or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night, event or any other activity where live patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the conduct prescribed in subsections (1) and (2) of this section. 
                  Sec. 4-383. - Liability of licensee for conduct of persons in licensed premises. 
                  It shall be unlawful for a licensee to permit any conduct prohibited in this article that he knows or has reasonable cause to know is taking place on the premises. Any such conduct by a licensee shall be a violation of this Code and shall be punishable as provided in section 1-15 and shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of any license issued under this chapter.

                  Sec. 18-32. - Right to challenge electors; procedure. 
                  (a)	Any elector of the municipality may challenge the right of any other elector of the municipality, whose name appears on the list of electors, to vote in an election. Such challenge shall be in writing and specify distinctly the grounds of such challenge. Such challenge may be made at any time prior to the elector whose right to vote is being challenged voting at the elector's polling place or, if such elector cast an absentee ballot, prior to 5:00 p.m. on the day before the election; provided, however, that challenges to persons voting by absentee ballot in person at the office of the registrar or the absentee ballot clerk, whose vote is cast on a direct recording electronic (DRE) unit, must be made prior to such person's voting. 
                  (b)	Upon the filing of such challenge, the board of registrars shall immediately consider such challenge and determine whether probable cause exists to sustain such challenge. If the registrars do not find probable cause, the challenge shall be denied. If the registrars find probable cause, the registrars shall notify the poll officers of the challenged elector's district or, if the challenged elector voted by absentee ballot, notify the poll officers at the absentee ballot precinct and, if practical, notify the challenged elector and afford such elector an opportunity to answer. 
                  (c)	If the challenged elector appears at the polling place to vote, such elector shall be given the opportunity to appear before the registrars and answer the grounds of the challenge. 
                  (d)	If the challenged elector does not cast an absentee ballot and does not appear at the polling place to vote and if the challenge is based on grounds other than the qualifications of the elector to remain on the list of electors, no further action by the registrars shall be required. 
                  (e)	If the challenged elector cast an absentee ballot and it is not practical to conduct a hearing prior to the close of the polls and the challenge is based upon grounds other than the qualifications of the elector to remain on the list of electors, the absentee ballot shall be treated as a challenged ballot pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 21-2-386(e). No further action by the registrars shall be required. 
                  (f)	If the challenged elector does not cast an absentee ballot and does not appear at the polling place to vote and the challenge is based on the grounds that the elector is not qualified to remain on the list of electors, the board of registrars shall proceed to hear the challenge pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 21-2-229. 
                  (g)	If the challenged elector cast an absentee ballot and the challenge is based upon grounds that the challenged elector is not qualified to remain on the list of electors, the board of registrars shall proceed to conduct a hearing on the challenge on an expedited basis prior to the certification of the consolidated returns of the election by the election superintendent. The election superintendent shall not certify such consolidated returns until such hearing is complete and the registrars have rendered their decision on the challenge. 
                  (h)	If the registrars deny the challenge, the superintendent shall proceed to certify the consolidated returns. If the registrars uphold the challenge, the name of the challenged elector shall be removed from the list of electors and ballot of the challenged elector shall be rejected and not counted and, if necessary, the returns shall be adjusted to remove any votes cast by such elector. The elector making the challenge and the challenged elector may appeal the decision of the registrars in the same manner as provided in O.C.G.A. § 21-2-229(e). 
                  (i)	If the challenged elector appears at the polls to vote and it is practical to conduct a hearing on the challenge prior to the close of the polls, the registrars shall conduct such hearing and determine the merits of the challenge. If the registrars deny the challenge, the elector shall be permitted to vote in the election notwithstanding the fact that the polls may have closed prior to the time the registrars render their decision and the elector can actually vote, provided that the elector proceeds to vote immediately after the decision of the registrars. If the registrars uphold the challenge, the challenged elector shall not be permitted to vote and, if the challenge is based upon the grounds that the elector is not qualified to remain on the list of electors, the challenged elector's name shall be removed from the list of electors. 
                  (j)	If the challenged elector appears at the polls to vote and it is not practical to conduct a hearing prior to the close of the polls or if the registrars begin a hearing and subsequently find that a decision on the challenge cannot be rendered within a reasonable time, the challenged elector shall be permitted to vote by having the word "challenged" and the elector's name written across the back of the elector's ballot notwithstanding the fact that the polls may have closed prior to the time the registrars make such a determination, provided that the elector proceeds to vote immediately after such determination of the registrars. In such cases, if the challenged is based upon the grounds that the challenged elector is not qualified to remain on the list of electors, the registrars shall proceed to finish the hearing prior to the certification of the consolidated returns of the election by the election superintendent. If the challenge is based on other grounds, no further action shall be required by the registrars. The election superintendent shall not certify such consolidated returns until such hearing is complete and the registrars have rendered their decision on the challenge. 
                  (k)	If the registrars deny the challenge, the superintendent shall proceed to certify the consolidated returns. If the registrars uphold the challenge, the name of the challenged elector shall be removed from the list of electors and the ballot of the challenged elector shall be rejected and not counted and, if necessary, the returns shall be adjusted to remove any votes cast by such elector. The elector making the challenge and the challenged elector may appeal the decision of the registrars in the same manner, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 21-2-229(e).

                  (d)	No campaign literature, booklet, pamphlet, card, sign, or other written or printed matter shall be displayed in any building containing a room under the control or supervision of the registrars or absentee ballot clerk in which absentee ballots are cast during the period when absentee ballots are available for voting. These restrictions shall not apply to conduct occurring in private offices or areas which cannot be seen or heard by such electors. 
                  (e)	No person shall solicit signatures for any petition within a room under the control or supervision of the registrars or absentee ballot clerk in which absentee ballots are being cast on any day.

                  (g)	No person whose name appears as a candidate on the ballot being voted upon at a primary election, special primary, or special election, except a judge of the probate court serving as the election superintendent, shall physically enter any polling place other than the polling place, at which that person is authorized to cast his ballot for that primary election, special primary, or special election and, after casting his ballot, the candidate shall not return to such polling place until after the poll has closed and voting has ceased.

                  (h)	This section shall not be construed to prohibit a poll officer from distributing materials, as required by law, which are necessary for the purpose of instructing electors or from distributing materials prepared by the secretary of state that are designed solely for the purpose of encouraging voter participation in the election being conducted.

                  Sec. 22-19. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)	The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
                  (b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.

                  Sec. 22-20. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (1)	To protect human life and health;
                  (2)	To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize floodblight areas; 
                  (4)	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
                  (5)	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)	To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
                  (7)	To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

The market value of the building should be: 
                  (1)	The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  (2)	In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
                  This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.

                  c.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions; 
                  d.	So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; 
                  e.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; 
                  (10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 22-84. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 22-83, pertaining to elevated buildings. 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in an A1-30, AE, or AH zone, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 22-62(a)(6). 
                  (3)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved:
                  1.	On individual lots or parcels;
                  2.	In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
                  3.	In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
                  4.	On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement (ref. section 22-83(6)). 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  1.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  2.	Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a and c of this section. 
                  (4)	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 22-24 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted; provided, however, it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.	Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

                  (d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)	In reviewing such requests, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)	Conditions for variances.
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  DIVISION 2. - LAND USE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE 

                  Sec. 42-40. - Purpose and intent; adoption of similar provisions by city and county. 
                  The governing authorities of the city and Bleckley County have found it necessary, desirable, and in the public interest to establish a formal process for resolving land use disputes as they relate to property annexation and land use plans. This article is intended to establish that process and, to that end, the city and county have adopted similar provisions. 
                  Sec. 42-41. - Procedure. 
                  (a)	Prior to initiating any formal annexation activities, the municipality will notify the county of a proposed annexation and provide information on location of property, size of area, and proposed land use or zoning classification, if applicable, of the property. 
                  (b)	Within 30 days following receipt of the information required in subsection (a) of this section, the county will forward to the city a statement indicating that the county has no objection to the proposed land use for the property or describing its bona fide objection to the city's proposed land use classification, providing supporting evidence, and listing any possible stipulations or conditions that would alleviate the county's objections. 
                  (c)	If the county has no objection to the city's proposed land use or zoning classification, the city is free to proceed with the annexation. If the county fails to respond to the city's notice in writing within the deadline, the city is free to proceed with the annexation and the county loses its right to invoke the dispute resolution process, or object to land use changes after the annexation. 
                  (d)	If the county notifies the city that it has bonafide land use classification objections, the city will respond to the county in writing within 30 days of receiving the county's objections by either: 
                  (1)	Agreeing to implement the county's stipulations and conditions, thereby resolving the county's objection; 
                  (2)	Agreeing with the county and stopping action on the proposed annexation; or
                  (3)	Disagreeing that the county's objections are bona fide, in which event the city will initiate a joint meeting of the respective governments to resolve the issue. 
                  (e)	If the city initiates mediation, the city and the county will agree on a mediator, mediation schedule and determine participants on the mediation. The city and county agree to share equally any costs associated with the mediation. 
                  (f)	An annexation proposal shall not be effective until any bona fide land use classification objections raised by the county are resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution process. 
                  (g)	The final resolution of any recommendation of a land use classification will be accorded to the governing body considering the annexation. In cases of land use disputes not related to annexation proposals, the final resolution of a land use dispute will be accorded to the jurisdiction in which the subject property is located. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, either local government entity may seek declaratory judgment in a court of proper jurisdiction pursuant to a land use decision.

                  ARTICLE V. - STREET ACCEPTANCE 

                  Sec. 50-129. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to set minimum standards for streets and roadways to be accepted into the city road system so as to provide for the public economy, safety and orderly traffic flow and movement, and for other purposes. 
                  (Ord. of 1996, § I)

                  This article shall apply to streets and roads constructed and built by individuals and developers who propose to induce the city to accept such streets and roadways into the public transportation system of the city. This article shall not work to restrict the city from constructing its own roadways and streets in any instance and at any location wherein such construction is in the interest of the public and for enlarging, increasing or improving the flow of traffic and to provide needed accesses for ingress and egress for public purposes.

                  (a)	Estimate of gross receipts. If any operator fails to make a return, the city clerk shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the operator or, as the case may be, of the amount of the total rentals in this city which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period in respect to which the person failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is or may come into the possession of the city clerk. Upon the basis of this estimate the city clerk shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid the city, adding to the sum thus determined a penalty equal to 15 percent thereof. One or more determinations may be made of the amount due for one or more monthly periods.

                  (d)	Method of giving written notice. Promptly after making his determination, the city clerk shall give to the operator written notice of his determination, which notice may be served personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency determination.

                  (a)	Time within which action must be taken. When it is determined by a return filed, or by the city clerk having made a determination that tax is due and payable to the city under the provisions of this article, the city clerk may at any time within three years after determination that such tax is due and payable bring an action in the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction in the name of the city to collect the amount of tax payable to the city together with interest thereon and penalties, court costs, attorney's fees and other legal fees incident thereto. The bringing of such an action shall not be a prerequisite for the issuance of a fi.fa. under the provisions of this section. 
                  (b)	Duty of successors or assignees of operator to withhold tax from purchase money. If any operator liable for any amount of tax under this article sells or transfers his business, his successors or assigns shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase price of the business to cover such amount of tax, interest thereon, and penalties, and pay such sum over to the city, unless the operator liable for such tax delivers to such purchaser or transferee, as the case may be, at the time of such sale or transfer, a certificate from the city clerk showing that all tax returns required of such operator have been filed and all taxes shown as being payable on said returns have been paid in full. 
                  (c)	Liability for failure to withhold; time to enforce successor's liability. If the purchaser or transferee of a business fails to withhold the required amount of the purchase price, he shall be personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells or transfers his business, or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs the later. 
                  (d)	Issuance of fi.fa. The city clerk is hereby authorized to issue a fi.fa. for execution and levy to satisfy the amount of any tax, penalty, or interest due but not paid under the provisions of this article.

                  (3)	Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
                  (4)	Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of this section. If the wastewater treatment operator permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the wastewater treatment operator, and subject to the requirement of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. 
                  (h)	Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when in the opinion of the wastewater treatment operator, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the wastewater treatment operator, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
                  (i)	Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. 
                  (j)	When required by the wastewater treatment operator, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the wastewater treatment operator. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
                  (k)	All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this ordinance shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples. 
                  (l)	No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the industrial concern.

                  When used in this article, the following words and phrases shall have meanings given in this section: 
                  Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations, promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR 261, and as amended. 
                  Lot means the contiguous land in the same ownership which is not divided by any public highway or alley, including any part thereof subject to any easement for any purpose other than a public highway or alley, but excluding any part thereof severed from another lot where the severance creates any nonconformity of size or use. 
                  Perennial river/stream means a river/stream or section of a river/stream that normally flows continuously throughout the whole year. 
                  Protected river corridor means all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of a protected river within a distance of 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river measured from the uppermost part of the riverbank; the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the water is included in the protected area. 
                  River/stream bank means the rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  Subdivision means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose of sale, legacy, or building development, whether immediate or future. The term "subdivision" includes all divisions or resubdivisions of land involving a new road or change in existing roads. Excluded from this definition is the combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased. 
                  Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. The term "wetlands" generally includes swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

                  Sec. 60-236. - Findings of fact. 
                  The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities.

                  Sec. 60-238. - Wetlands development permit requirements. 
                  No activity or use, except those identified in section 60-239, shall be allowed within wetland areas without a permit under this article. If there appear to be wetlands on any site under consideration for a permit which any proposed development may disturb and which appears to be under the jurisdiction of section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1311 et seq., a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' determination shall be required. No local permit will be issued until the person requesting the permit at his own expense obtains a section 404 permit or letter of permission from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines there are no jurisdictional wetlands involved, this determination will take precedence over the national wetlands inventory map and the permit issuance under sections 60-205 and 60-208 may proceed as if no wetland areas are involved.

                  Sec. 60-239. - Permitted uses not requiring a permit. 
                  The following uses are permitted without a permit within the wetlands of the city to the extent said uses are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided the uses do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging, except as provided herein: 
                  (1)	Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission. Section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1311 et seq., does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, section 404 does list some required road construction best management practices that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption. 
                  (2)	Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, or other wildlife; provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (3)	Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  (4)	Natural water quality treatment or purification.
                  (5)	Normal agriculture activities including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture.

                  Sec. 60-264. - Findings of fact. 
                  Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste, like septic tank effluents, contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.

                  All new uses except those identified in section 60-267 and those subject to further restriction by any underlying zoning district are allowed. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
                  (1)	All new aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks, and shall otherwise meet the requirements of U.S. EPA rules for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt; provided such tanks comply with all federal requirements. 
                  (2)	All new single-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings, mobile home parks, or other uses located within a groundwater recharge area and not served by both public water and sewer systems shall be required to have a minimum lot or space size at least 150 percent of normal requirements of the state department of human resources according to its manual for on-site sewage management systems for the particular location and soil characteristics involved, but said minimum lot or space size shall not be in any case less than the minimum lot or space size specified by any underlying zoning district. The regulations specifying the largest minimum lot or space size shall apply. 
                  (3)	All lots shall have a minimum width of 150 feet, or as specified in any underlying zoning district if stricter (larger), in the area where an approved on-site sewage management system is to be located. 
                  (4)	All new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner except for the construction of mining settling basins. 
                  (5)	All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compact clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 by 10-7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service.

                  Perennial rivers or watercourses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second are of vital importance to the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. These river corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters.
