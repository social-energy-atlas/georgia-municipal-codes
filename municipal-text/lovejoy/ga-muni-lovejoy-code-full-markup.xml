PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Lovejoy, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were ordinances adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Amy Norton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Marie Burnham, City Clerk, and Ms. L'Erin Wiggins, City Attorney, for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Printed herein is the Charter for the City of Lovejoy, Georgia as adopted and set forth in 1976 Ga. Laws (Act No. 1321), page 3897. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings and catchlines has been used. The word "Section" has been changed to "Sec." in catchlines. In addition, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-32-1, the term "recorders court" has been changed to "municipal court" and the terms "recorder" and "city recorder" have been changed to "municipal judge." Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

The mayor and council may, by ordinance, adopt rules and bylaws to govern the conduct of its business, including procedures and penalties for compelling the attendance of absent members. The mayor and council may provide by ordinance for punishment for contemptuous behavior conducted in the presence of the mayor and council. 
                  The mayor shall, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, give good and sufficient bond in an amount to be decided by the mayor and council, but not less than twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500.00), said bond payable to the City of Lovejoy for the faithful performance of his duties and to secure against corruption, malfeasance, misappropriations or unlawful expenditures. Said surety bond shall be obtained from a surety company licensed to do business in the State of Georgia and approved by the mayor and council, and the premium thereon shall be paid by the city.

                  Sec. 2.07. - Mayor pro tem. 
                  The mayor and council at the first regular meeting, and after the newly elected councilmen have taken office following each regular election, shall elect from its membership a mayor pro tem for a term of one (1) year.

                  In the event a vacancy occurs in the office of a member of the council from any cause other than the expiration of a term of office, the vacancy shall be filled in the following manner:

                  Sec. 2-86. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  City official or official, unless otherwise expressly defined, does not include city employees, but does mean the mayor, members of the city council, city manager, city clerk, and all appointed officers and persons holding positions designated by the city Charter. The term "city official" or "official" also includes all individuals, including city employees, appointed by the mayor and/or city council, as appropriate, to city authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the city council. 
                  Decision means any ordinance, resolution, contract, franchise, formal action or other matter voted on by the mayor and council or other city boards or commissions, as well as discussions or deliberations of the mayor and council, board or commission which can or may lead to a vote or formal action by that body. 
                  Discretionary authority means the power to exercise any judgment in a decision or action. 
                  Entity means a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited partnership, firm, corporation, professional corporation, holding company, joint stock company, receivership, trust or any other entity recognized by law through which business may be conducted. 
                  Interest means, but is not limited to, ownership or membership in an entity; receipt or payment of funds from or to an entity or person within in the last 12 months for salary, bonus, payment for products or goods or professional fees; creditor/debtor relationship; or ownership in real property. The term "interest" does not mean an interest of a person or entity, including a city official, which would be affected in the same way as the general public. The interest of a councilmember in the property tax rate, general city fees, or a comprehensive zoning ordinance or similar decisions is incidental to the extent that the city official would be affected in common with the general public; therefore, such interest shall not be deemed a conflict of interest where the official must refrain from participation. 
                  Member means an elected member of the city council, or any individual, including city employees, appointed by the mayor and/or city council, as appropriate, to city authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the city council. 
                  Member of the family means spouse, mother, father, brother, sister, son or daughter of a local government official or the spouse-in-law, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law or daughter-in-law of a local government official.

                  (d)  No city official shall directly or indirectly receive, or agree to receive, any compensation, gift, reward or gratuity in any matter or proceeding connected with, or related to, the duties of his office, except as may be provided by law.

                  (i)  No city official or employee shall grant or make available to any person any consideration, treatment, advantage or favor beyond that which it is the general practice to grant or make available to the public at-large. 
                  (j)  A city official shall not directly or indirectly make use of, or permit others to make use of, official information not made available to the general public for the purpose of furthering a private interest.

                  Sec. 2-89. - Complaints. 
                  (a)  Any person having a complaint against a person covered under this article for an alleged ethics violation shall file in writing a verified complaint setting forth the particular facts and circumstances which constitute the alleged violation with the city clerk. The judge of municipal court shall be notified of the alleged violation and shall hold a hearing within 30 days of being notified of the alleged violation. 
                  (b)  Once a complaint against a person covered by this article is filed with the city clerk, the complainant shall be compelled to submit to an examination, under oath, by the municipal court judge. The complainant may appear with or without counsel, at their own expense. The municipal court judge may dismiss a complaint at any point it determines the complaint to be frivolous, without completing an investigation of its substantive merits. A complaint brought solely to attain political advantage shall be deemed frivolous.

                  (8)  In the event two or more applicants for licenses under this section are both located less than the minimum distance required by state law from each other, that fact shall not disqualify either from the random drawing described hereinabove. In the event two or more of those applications so located are drawn in the selection, only the earliest drawn shall be eligible for issuance of a license under this section if all other requirements are met. 
                  (c)  Application and selection for subsequent licenses. In the event that less than the maximum number of licenses permitted under this section have been issued, the following procedure shall be employed for the application and selection process. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of this subsection, a vacancy shall not be considered to exist until one of the following have occurred: 
                  a.  A license has been surrendered; 
                  b.  A license has expired without renewal; 
                  c.  A license has been revoked pursuant to this section or any other lawful authority. Such vacancy shall not have occurred until the review of said revocation is complete. 
                  (2)  Within 15 days of a vacancy occurring, the clerk shall post in the legal organ a notice of said vacancy and the time applications will be accepted. 
                  (3)  Applications shall be accepted for a period of 15 days. 
                  (4)  All applications accepted during this period shall be examined by the clerk as described above for completeness and all required investigations be completed no later than 30 days after the close of the application period. 
                  (5)  The clerk shall examine said application for completeness and, if it is not complete, shall return the same to the manager within ten days, with an explanation of the incomplete items. 
                  (6)  The clerk shall collect all applications meeting the criteria for issuance of licenses and draw from that collection two applications for each available license. The clerk shall ensure that the drawing is completely at random, according to methods determined by the clerk. The clerk shall, upon drawing each application, number them consecutively. The first license issued shall go to the lowest number, the second to the second lowest number. That process shall be followed until each license is issued. 
                  (7)  In the event an application being selected for issuance of a license is not issued a license pursuant to this enactment within 20 days of selection, the application with the next lowest number shall be issued a license. 
                  (8)  The time for each drawing and selection as set out above shall be established by the clerk, posted at city hall, and each manager shall be notified not less than five days in advance. Applicants and the public may be present and observe the drawing process.

                  Sec. 4-267. - Application to be made annually; expiration thereof. 
                  (a)  Expiration. Each license granted under this article shall automatically expire on the last day of December each year. The holder of a license must reapply on or before October 31 in order to have the same considered for continuance into the following year. Since the license is a privilege, there shall be no right of continuance inuring to the holder of a license and the same may be revoked with cause after a hearing before the mayor and council prior to December 31, as provided in this article. 
                  (b)  Revocation by revenue commissioner. When a license issued by the state revenue commissioner to engage in the business described in this article is revoked, such action shall automatically revoke the license issued by the city. Presentation to the city clerk of the revocation by the state revenue commissioner of the licensee's privilege to engage in package sales shall operate to revoke the license automatically. 
                  (c)  Renewal application. Renewal of an existing license must be accompanied by a statement executed by each owner and the manager certifying the following: 
                  (1)  The ownership has not changed. 
                  (2)  No owner or manager has been convicted of an offense that would otherwise prevent the issuance of a license pursuant to this article. 
                  (3)  That the residence of owners has not changed such as would not meet the qualifications for issuance of a license pursuant to this article. 
                  (4)  That no taxes, fees or other sums are due the city, the state, or any political subdivision thereof as a result of the operation of the establishment. 
                  (d)  Renewal fee; annual fee. An annual renewal fee in the amount established by the city and amendable by resolution shall be paid at the time the renewal application is submitted. This fee shall be nonrefundable, and shall, upon renewal of the license, serve as the annual fee. 
                  (e)  Investigation. Upon receiving the renewal application, the clerk shall cause an investigation to verify the information contained in the application. Such an investigation may be performed by the clerk or his designee.

                  (a)  Prohibited locations. 
                  (1)  No licensee shall operate such business within: 
                  a.  300 feet of any church; 
                  b.  500 feet of any school teaching elementary, middle school, high school or college curriculum; 
                  c.  300 feet from any alcoholic treatment center operated by any unit of government;

                  (2)  Distances shall be measured by the most direct route of vehicular travel from the entrances of the respective structures. 
                  (b)  Zoning requirements. No license shall be issued for an establishment to be operated under this article in other than a property zoned General Business (GB) under the zoning ordinances of the city, appendix A. In the event provisions of this article are more stringent concerning the placement of and construction of establishments licensed under this article or are in conflict with the zoning ordinance of this city, the more stringent requirements shall apply. 
                  (c)  Other requirements for location, structure. 
                  (1)  Any structure housing an establishment licensed under this article shall not contain any other business.

                  Sec. 4-269. - Requirements for owners, managers and employees. 
                  (a)  Disqualifications. No applicant shall be issued a license under this article if: 
                  (1)  Any owner has been convicted of a felony under the laws of this state, the United States, or any political subdivision thereof; 
                  (2)  Any owner has been convicted of any offense involving alcoholic beverages, marijuana, or controlled substances within the five years next preceding the application's date of submission. This provision shall not preclude a person convicted of one offense of driving under the influence of alcohol or any substantially similar offense under the laws of any other state or political subdivision from obtaining a license under this article; 
                  (3)  Any owner has had a license or permit authorizing the sale, possession, distribution or serving of alcoholic beverages revoked, suspended or withheld by any municipality, county or state, the United States, or any political subdivision thereof; 
                  (4)  At least one owner has not been a resident of the state for at least ten years next preceding the submission of the application for licensure under this article. 
                  (5)  Any owner is indebted to the city or the county for taxes, license fees or assessments, and said sums are past due; 
                  (6)  He is an elected or appointed official, employee or agent of the city, including the spouse thereof; 
                  (7)  The application must designate a manager of the business responsible for the daily operation of the business. The application shall provide a home or cellular telephone number for the manager that is in service at all times. 
                  (b)  Qualifications of manager. The person designated as manager of the business on the application shall meet the same qualifications as an owner. 
                  (c)  Duties of manager. The person designated as a manager for the business shall:

                  (2)  Be responsible for receiving all summons, notices, levies and other correspondence from the city;

                  (1)  This subsection does not apply to persons engaged in the dispensing, serving or sale of alcoholic beverages.

                  (3)  No person may be employed by or contract to perform duties in an establishment licensed under this article if he has ever had a felony conviction involving the possession, sale, manufacture or use of alcoholic beverages or has a conviction involving a misdemeanor of the same offenses specified above within the past ten years, next preceding the date of application. For the purposes of this article, a plea of nolo contendere shall be considered a conviction.

                  Sec. 4-270. - Transferability of alcoholic beverages licenses; fee required to change establishment owner, manager, partnership, stockholders, or establishment name. 
                  (a)  License transferability. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all alcoholic beverage licenses shall be personal to the owner or owners and shall not be transferable. 
                  (b)  Death of an individual owner. In case of the death of an owner of an establishment, no sale of alcoholic beverages shall be allowed until such time as a personal representative of the estate, appointed by a probate court of competent jurisdiction, shall apply to the city clerk for authorization to continue sales notwithstanding the death of the owner. Upon submission of an application, together with an application fee in the amount established by the city, the establishment shall be allowed to operate for a period of 60 days from the date of death, until expiration of the license, or until the approval of a new license under this subsection (b), whichever shall first occur. In the event an application for a new license is submitted pursuant to this subsection (b), it shall be reviewed and acted upon notwithstanding the drawing provisions of section 4-266(c), which will not be applicable. By way of explanation, in the event of the death of an owner, the personal representative of the estate, a devisee or an heir, whichever is appropriate, may apply for and obtain (if qualified) a new license in the place and stead of the license previously held by the deceased and the grant of a license to this individual shall not trigger the drawing process set forth in section 4-266(c), nor shall it entitle others to apply. Upon issuance of a new license pursuant to this subsection (b), the previous license shall be revoked by operation of law. No additional license fee shall be required during the period for which the original license was issued. The owner of a new license issued under this subsection (b) shall be entitled to reapply annually for a renewal license in the same manner as the prior deceased owner. 
                  (c)  Sale of establishment by business entity. 
                  (1)  If an owner who is not an individual (i.e., a corporation, limited liability company, general partnership, limited partnership, or limited liability partnership) desires to sell all of its interest in a licensed establishment (either by the sale of all assets or by the sale of all stock or other interests in the business entity which is the owner, as the case may be), the owner shall inform the city clerk in writing of its intent to sell and shall identify the proposed transferee of the license. Upon such notification by the owner, the proposed transferee shall have 15 business days thereafter to submit an application to the city clerk (together with an application fee in the amount established by city and amendable by resolution) in accordance with the requirements of sections 4-265 and 4-266(a). In the event an application is filed pursuant to this subsection, it shall be reviewed and acted upon notwithstanding the drawing provisions of section 4-265(c), which will not be applicable, and the city clerk's receipt of such an application shall not entitle others to apply. Upon receipt of a complete application, the city clerk shall have 15 days following receipt to inform the proposed transferee as to whether or not the application meets the requirements of this ordinance. If the application meets the requirements of this ordinance, upon receipt of joint written instructions from the present license holder and the proposed transferee, the city clerk shall issue a new license to the proposed transferee for the same location and the previous license for the location in issue shall be revoked by operation of law. No additional license fees shall be required during the period for which the original license was issued. The owner of a new license issued under this subsection shall be entitled to reapply annually for a renewal license in the same manner as the prior owner. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this subsection are only applicable to an established location which has been licensed and engaged in business for at least two years. 
                  (d)  Spacing requirements, etc. Provided the establishment met the requirements of section 4-268 at the time of issuance of the original license, the application of a proposed transferee under subsection (b) or (c) of this section shall be deemed to meet the requirements of that section. By way of explanation, if, for example, the establishment was not within 300 feet of any church at the time the initial license was issued, but at the time the application of the new owner or proposed transferee is submitted, the establishment is within 300 feet of a church because a new church has been constructed since the issuance of the original license, this fact shall not disqualify the new owner or transferee from being entitled to a new license. 
                  (e)  Withdrawal from partnership or sale or transfer of minority ownership. Nothing in this section shall prohibit one or more members of a general or a limited partnership holding a license hereunder (i.e., the partnership holds the license) to withdraw from the partnership in favor of one or more of the partners who were partners at the time of the issuance of the license. The occurrence of such event shall not be deemed to be a transfer of ownership in violation of this section. Likewise, nothing in this section shall prohibit any member of a general or a limited partnership holding a license hereunder who owns a minority interest (less than 50 percent) from selling or transferring his interest, but only in the event the partnership holding the license had a majority owner (more than 50 percent) who was previously identified to the city at the time the license was issued and the aforesaid majority owner remains unchanged. 
                  (f)  Sale or transfer of stock under certain circumstances. If the license issued under this chapter is held by a corporation or a limited liability company, if a shareholder or member holding a minority interest (less than 50 percent) in the corporation or limited liability company desires to sell or transfer his shares in the corporation, nothing in this section shall prohibit the same, but only in the event the corporation holding the license had a majority owner (more than 50 percent) who was previously identified to the city at the time the license was issued and the aforesaid majority owner remains unchanged. 
                  (g)  Transfer of location of establishment. Any licensee who desires to transfer the location of an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages within the city shall so notify the city prior to any transfer of location. The mayor and council, or their designee, shall determine whether the new location is in compliance with all provisions of this chapter and state law. No change in the location of a licensed establishment shall be permitted unless the new location complies with all provisions of this chapter. The mayor and council shall have the authority to approve or deny the transfer of location in the same manner that it may approve or deny the issuance of a new license. An investigative fee in the amount established by the city and amendable by resolution shall be paid by the licensee at the time that an application is made for the transfer of an establishment location. Should a transfer of location be approved, with no change of ownership of the business, the license fee paid for the old location shall be applied to the new location. 
                  (h)  Change of establishment name. Any licensee who desires to change the name of an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages within the city shall so notify the city clerk prior to any change of name, and the city clerk shall direct the issuance of a corrected license in replacement of the original license. The application may be denied by the mayor and council upon their finding that the proposed name of the business is the same as or confusingly similar to an existing business or a trade name of another entity. A fee in the amount established by the city and amendable by resolution shall be paid by the licensee at the time that an application is made for the change of an establishment name. 
                  (i)  Change of manager. Any licensee who changes the manager of an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages within the city shall so notify the city clerk within three days of the effective date of such change and shall file with the city clerk such information about the new establishment manager as the city clerk may require. A fee in the amount established by the city and amendable by resolution shall be paid at the time that an application is made for change of an establishment manager and investigation into the manager-designee.

                  Where a building intended for the sale of alcoholic beverages is at the time of the application for such license not in existence or not yet completed, a license may be issued for such location, provided the plans for the proposed building show clear compliance with all provisions of this chapter and applicable provisions of this Code. No sales shall be allowed in such establishment, however, until it has been completed in accordance with such plans and is inspected by the city clerk to ensure compliance with city codes.

                  (a)  All holders of licenses under this chapter must open for business within 12 months after issuance of the license at the establishment referred to in the license. Failure to open the licensed establishment within such time shall automatically forfeit and cancel the unused license, and no refund of license fees shall be made to the license holder. 
                  (b)  Any holder of a license under this chapter who shall begin the operation of the business as authorized in the license but who shall cease to operate the business as authorized in the license for a period of three consecutive months shall, upon completion of the three-month period, automatically forfeit his license. Such license shall, by virtue of such failure to operate, be cancelled by the mayor and council or their designee.

                  (c)  Signs; advertising. No form of advertising shall be permitted on the exterior of any licensed premises suggesting either the brand or price of any alcoholic beverage. No form of advertising brand or price; offering reduced prices, or the like, shall be posted in or upon the premises such as to be visible from the exterior of the structure. This shall not be construed to prohibit the posting of the business' name, consistent with other provisions of this code of ordinances. 
                  (d)  Pricing, price lists. If each outer container or package in which products licensed to be sold under this article are not marked with the price, the establishment shall have at least five price lists of all products no so marked available to the customers. In lieu of the above, the individual prices of every product not so marked may be displayed by electronic means, accessible or visible to every customer. 
                  (e)  Minors prohibited.

                  (4)  That the employee is on parole or probation unless the applicant provides sufficient proof that the employee will not violate the terms of such parole or probation by the employment in an establishment serving alcohol; or 
                  (5)  That the employee has any outstanding arrest warrants for whom no service has been perfected. 
                  In the event there is a criminal record discovered that would exclude the issuance of a photo permit, the designated agent of the police department shall issue a letter to the person fingerprinted, to the city clerk, and to the employer, stating that the person is ineligible for employment. 
                  (b)  Any employee excluded from receiving or holding a photo permit under the terms of this section shall have the right to appeal such exclusion to the governing body, which may in its discretion approve the issuance of a photo permit. 
                  (c)  The failure of an employee to get a photo permit will not prohibit the employee from applying for and receiving one if all other conditions of this section are otherwise met. However, failure to present a valid permit upon request/check by a city official, shall be a violation of this chapter and shall subject the violator to a city ordinance violation to be adjudicated in the municipal court.

                  Sec. 8-284. - Purpose. 
                  The mayor and council find that the breeding of dogs and cats acquired by the public from animal control shelters and private animal shelters and humane societies results in the birth of hundreds of animals who become strays, suffer privation and death, constitute a public nuisance and health hazard, and ultimately are impounded and destroyed at great public expense. It is therefore declared to be the policy of the city that preventing the breeding of dogs and cats acquired from such shelters and humane societies be encouraged.

                  (f)  In the event that the adopted dog or cat is stolen, the adopting person shall file a police report with the appropriate jurisdiction, stating the circumstances of theft and a description of the animal in as much detail as possible. The police report shall be presented to animal control before the due date of the sterilization to relieve the adopting person of the sterilization requirement. 
                  (g)  In the event that the adopted dog or cat runs away, or is lost or is given away by the adopting person, the adopting person shall not be relieved from the sterilization requirement. However, upon disposition of a case where this subsection is applicable, the adopting person shall be relieved of future responsibility as to that dog or cat. 
                  (h)  If the dog or cat is unable to be sterilized due to a medical condition or other reason which would affect the dog's or cat's well-being, the adopting person shall provide a written statement from a licensed veterinarian attesting to the condition preventing the animal's sterilization. If such written statement is not in the possession of the animal control unit on or before the due date for sterilization, it shall constitute the offense of failure to sterilize against the adopting person. 
                  (i)  It shall be the sole responsibility of the adopting person to provide proof of sterilization, on or before the due date of sterilization, to the county animal control unit. In the event of a dispute as to the due date of sterilization, a licensed veterinarian shall determine the due date of sterilization; said determination shall be in writing and in the possession of the animal control unit on or before the previous due date of sterilization.

                  105.1.3. Quorum. Three members of the board shall constitute a quorum. In varying the application of any provisions of the building or fire codes, or in modifying an order of the building inspector, or fire marshal of the county, affirmative votes of the majority present, but not less than three affirmative votes, shall be required. A board member shall not act in a case in which he has a personal interest. 
                  105.1.4. Secretary, records. The building inspector shall act as secretary to the board of adjustments and appeals.

Every decision shall be promptly filed in writing in the office of the building inspector and fire marshal and shall be open to public inspection. A certified copy shall be sent by mail or otherwise to the appellant and a copy shall be kept publicly posted in the office of the building inspector and fire marshal for two weeks after filing.

                  105.2.1. General. Whenever the building inspector or fire marshal of the county shall reject or refuse to approve the mode or manner of construction proposed to be followed or materials to be used in the installation or alteration of a building or structure, or when it is claimed that the provisions of the building or fire codes do not apply, or that any equally good or more desirable form of installation can be employed in any specific case, or when it is claimed that the true intent and meaning of the building or fire codes or any of the regulations thereunder have been misconstrued or incorrectly interpreted, the owner of such building or structure, or his duly authorized agent, may appeal from the decision of the building inspector or fire marshal to the board of adjustments and appeals. Notice of appeal shall be in writing and filed within 30 days after the decision is rendered by the building inspector or fire marshal.

The board of adjustments and appeals, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of the building or fire codes to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of the codes or public interest, or when, in its opinion, the interpretation of the building inspector or fire marshal should be modified or reversed. 
                  105.3.2. Action. The board of adjustment and appeals shall, in every case, reach a decision without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. Each decision of the board shall also include the reasons for the decision.

                  105.3.3. Decisions are final. Every decision of the board of adjustments and appeals shall be final; subject, however, to such remedy as any aggrieved party has at law or in equity.

                  Sec. 10-863. - Application procedure; requirements. 
                  (a)  Any person who desires to move a house or other building or buildings into, out of or through the city shall first make application to the building inspector for an escort permit, such application to be made at least two calendar days prior to the date of movement. 
                  (b)  The applicant shall certify the routing of the movement, the date and time of the movement, the tonnage weight of the loaded vehicle or vehicles moving the building or buildings and the safety precautions to be utilized in the protection of personal and property rights of others during such movement. The building inspector may require additional information and/or safety precautions if, in his judgment, he does not believe the moving plans to be feasible or that the necessary safety precautions are being taken. If he does disapprove, he may require that a different routing and/or additional safety precautions be taken in order to protect the personal and property rights of individuals. 
                  (c)  The applicant must, upon making application, give the width, length and height of the building to be moved. No routing will be approved for movement without assurance that the movement can be made without disturbing or damaging obstructions on the sides or above the route to be taken. If there are any road signs, mailboxes, overhead wiring, traffic lights, traffic signals, bridges or other obstacles on the route chosen, it shall be the duty of the applicant to ensure that the building or structure that is being moved shall clear all of these obstructions without damage. 
                  (d)  Any person who desires to move a house or other building or buildings into, out of or through the city shall post with the building inspector a cash bond in the established by the city and amendable by resolution. Such bond shall be used to repair, replace or otherwise compensate the city or any citizens of the city damaged by the moving of a building or structure through the city. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of any person to the amount of the bond. If, after 15 days from the receipt of a notice of claim for damages to the mover, the mover fails to respond, the building inspector may, at his discretion, use such cash bond to replace, repair or otherwise compensate the person for damages caused by the movement of the building or structure. The amount of cash bond expended shall be deposited by the mover within ten days' notice by the building inspector to maintain the cash bond at the required minimum amount. Failure to post the cash bond and maintain the cash bond at the required minimum amount shall result in the denial of any and all applications for moving of buildings or structures into or through the city. This bond shall be refunded upon written notification from the person that they are ceasing to do business in the city. 
                  (e)  The applicant shall provide to the building inspector a certification from the county tax commissioner, and the taxing authorities of the city, that all ad valorem property taxes assessed against the building structure to be moved have been paid in full. In the event the current year's property taxes have not been assessed and/or billed, the applicant or property owner shall cause to be paid to the tax commissioner, and any taxing authority of an applicable municipality, an amount of property taxes assessed against the property to be moved equal to 80 percent of the amount assessed and/or paid on the property for the year immediately preceding the current year. Any payment caused to be made by the applicant or property owner in accordance with this section which is in excess of the finally determined tax liability shall be refunded to the applicant or property owner as the case may be. If the amount finally determined to be the tax liability for the property exceeds the amount paid under this section, the applicant or property owner shall be liable for the amount of the difference between the amount paid and the amount owed. In no event shall a moving permit be issued to an applicant to move any building structure through the city until the certification required by this section is tendered by the applicant. An applicant may have his business license suspended in the event any amounts provided to be paid under this section are due and owing to the county tax commissioner and/or taxing authorities of any applicable municipality.

The mayor and council, upon hearing an application, shall take into consideration all of the factors involved, including the relocation site, the buildings in the community where the relocation site is located, and all other matters pertinent to compatibility and feasibility of the proposed building's relocation, so as not to disturb the overall values of the community. Any building that is to be relocated in the city must have an inspection before it is moved, and the building inspector shall make his recommendation to the mayor and council as to whether or not it meets all of the standards of the city zoning laws, building codes, and other related subjects. If the mayor and council elects to award the relocation moving permit, once it is relocated it must be completely remodeled and meet final inspection of the building inspection department prior to occupancy and within 90 days from the date it is relocated.

                  (3)  Should the landowner be absentee and unable to be located after a reasonable and diligent search, only an affidavit from the applicant is required attesting that the landowner is absentee and that no fees have been required from him. 
                  (4)  The same requirements of this section apply shall be adhered to in the cases of the landowner being that of the city. An affidavit and receipt may be obtained from the city clerk's office at the time of application upon posting a bond in the amount established by the city and amendable by resolution. Said bond is collected to ensure the proper cleanup is performed after the movement of any building, home or mobile home off city property and to protect the city from any damages resulting from such move. The city shall return the bond within 14 days of the move upon inspection that the move of the building, home or mobile home was completed without harm to any city property. Otherwise, the bond will be forfeited.

                  (a)  Neighborhoods are facing significant threat of becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are abandoned, foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure. Improperly maintained and secured abandoned and/or foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of abandoned and/or foreclosed real property. There is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article. 
                  (b)  The foreclosure registry will require creditors or mortgagees to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing abandoned and/or foreclosed real property into compliance with applicable provisions of article XIII of this chapter; chapter 16, environmental and natural resources; chapter 22, health and sanitation; chapter 36, streets, sidewalks and other public places of the Code for the city.

                  Sec. 16-22. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in this subsection (b) and subsection (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This section shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16) and (17) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  Minimum protections to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.) for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this section, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.); 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;

                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsections (c)(16) and (17) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.), shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this section. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to the state Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970 (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq.) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this article, the term "maintenance" means actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented; 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented; 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in EPD Rule 391-3-7-.01(r) (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. 391-3-7-.01(r)), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities; 
                  e.  Nothing contained in the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.) shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection (b) of this section and this subsection; 
                  f.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 16-23. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal of the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city engineer to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city engineer or an authorized representative and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 16-22(c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 16-22(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10 (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. 391-3-7-.10). 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 16-22(c) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 16-22(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 16-22(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  (a)  The city engineer will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.). 
                  (c)  The city engineer shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and, for this purpose, to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 16-23(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose a penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of city ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under city ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  O.C.G.A. § 12-5-27.1 provides that whenever a local governmental entity is required by the environmental protection division to reduce phosphorus in its wastewater being discharged into the waters of the state, such local government entity shall pass an ordinance mandating the retail sale of low-phosphorus household laundry detergent as part of its phosphorus reduction process. It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the city to encourage the use of clean, phosphate-free household laundry detergents and to prohibit the sale of household laundry detergents which contain more than 0.5 percent phosphorus by weight. The city finds that such use and sale will be a cost-effective way to reduce the amount of phosphorus in wastewater discharge so as to protect the state's rivers and lakes downstream and promote health, safety and welfare, prevent injury to human health, plant and animal life and property. It is vital to the health, well-being and welfare of present and future inhabitants of the city that these sources be protected against contamination and pollution.

                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
                  (b)  Applicability. This chapter shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city. 
                  (c)  Designation of ordinance administrator. The city engineer or his designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (d)  Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard, areas of future-conditions flood hazard and associated floodplain characteristics; flood area maps and studies. For the purposes of defining and determining areas of special flood hazard, areas of future-conditions flood hazard, areas of shallow flooding, base flood elevations, floodplains, floodways, future-conditions flood elevations, future-conditions floodplains, potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRMs, and other terms used in this article, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto: 
                  (1)  The flood insurance study (FIS), dated ________, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto. 
                  (2)  Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the base or one-percent (100-year) floodplain and floodprone areas, including: 
                  a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the city; and 
                  b.  Any base flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA-approved methodology and approved by the city. 
                  (3)  Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the future-conditions flood elevation or delineation of the future-conditions floodplain and floodprone areas, including: 
                  a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the city; and

                  (a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Floodplain boundaries means: 
                  (1)  Studied A Zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
                  (2)  For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the city. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the city, then it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the city. 
                  Floodway boundaries means the width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA-approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the city. If floodway data is not available from the city, it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the city. 
                  (b)  General standards. 
                  (1)  No development shall be allowed within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following: 
                  a.  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
                  b.  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
                  c.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or 
                  d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
                  (2)  Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard allowed under subsection (b)(1) of this section shall also meet the following conditions: 
                  a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average groundwater table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average groundwater table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
                  b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
                  c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
                  d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (less than 0.01 foot), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-back water analysis meeting the requirements of subsection (c) of this section; 
                  e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and 
                  f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the city using the FEMA community concurrence forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of development, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys and plans for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). 
                  (c)  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the city prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  (1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  (2)  Step-back water analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the local permitting authority. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
                  (4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
                  (d)  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (d)(2) of this section; 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the city. 
                  (e)  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. The city may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the city.

                  Sec. 20-6. - Variance procedures. 
                  The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter: 
                  (1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the city. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  (2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the city engineer shall have the right to appeal such decision to the city council. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  (3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the county superior court as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (7)  In reviewing such requests, the city and city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (8)  Conditions for variances. 
                  a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  b.  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 28-1. - Public nuisance in relation to dwelling, building, structure or property. 
                  (a)  The mayor and council of the city, are authorized by O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-7 through 41-2-17 to exercise its police power to repair, close, or demolish certain defined dwellings, buildings, or structures in the manner provided in such sections when such property is in violation of the aforementioned code sections. 
                  (b)  The mayor and council of the city find that there exist in the incorporated area of the city dwellings, buildings, or structures which are unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business uses due to dilapidation and not in compliance with applicable codes; which have defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents, or other calamities; which lack adequate ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities; which have other conditions in existence which render such dwellings, buildings, or structures unsafe or unsanitary, or dangerous or detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare, or otherwise inimical to the welfare of the residents of such county; and which are vacant, dilapidated dwellings, buildings, or structures in which drug crimes are being committed. 
                  (c)  The definitions of terms in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-8(1)—(12) are adopted as the definitions of those terms as used in this article. 
                  (d)  It is the duty of the owner of every dwelling, building, structure, or property within the unincorporated areas of the county to construct and to maintain such dwelling, building, structure, or property in conformance with applicable codes in force within the jurisdiction, or such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on the property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or to maintain any dwelling, building, structure, or property in violation of such codes or ordinances. 
                  (e)  The city or its designee is authorized to exercise the powers prescribed by this article, and, as such, come within the definition of the term "public officer" in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-8(10). 
                  (f)  Charge, investigation, inspection, determination of unfit for habitation or use. 
                  (1)  Whenever a request is filed with the public officer designated in subsection (e) of this section by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause a summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties for such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction as determined by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain and at a place within the city. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
                  (2)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  a.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes. 
                  b.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  c.  For the purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, ch. 39A (O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq.), qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  d.  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  e.  If the public has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any monies received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of savaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and mayor and council are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  f.  That the amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.

The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  b.  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this chapter, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this chapter shall transmit to the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties.

A county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to this section in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer shall remit the amount collected to the mayor and council of the city. 
                  c.  Enforcement of liens may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
                  d.  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this section shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this section together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the mayor and council, county tax commissioner, municipal tax collector, or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (4)  The mayor and city council may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (5)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (6)  In addition to the procedures and remedies in this article, the mayor and councilmembers of the city may provide by ordinance that designated public officers may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this section. 
                  (7)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. 
                  (g)  Complaints issued by the public officer pursuant to this article shall be served in the manner provided for in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(a)—(h).

                  (1)  It is the responsibility of the mayor, council and employees of the city to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city ("city," hereinafter). The mayor and council are concerned about the increase in criminal activity engaged in by children and the increase in criminal activity that adversely affects children, especially criminal activity which occurs at hours and/or times after which children should be at home or in the company of responsible adults. The city and the county have experienced tragic and violent acts, involving serious injuries and even deaths, involving children in recent years, with many of these acts occurring after the hour set out herein for curfew. At numerous community meetings many citizens have voiced their concerns about the increase in child violence, the need to protect our children from being victims of crimes that occur after the hour set out in this section for curfew, and the need to make parents and adults more responsible for the children in their care. The mayor and council also find that there is a need to make other adults owning and operating certain establishments responsible for the presence of children at those establishments and locations. 
                  (2)  In an effort to keep the city drug free and the city's streets safe by reducing the numbers of crimes that are committed by and against children after the hour set out in this section for curfew, the mayor and council find that a child curfew ordinance is one initiative to protect children in the city from being the victims, as well as perpetrators, of crime. 
                  (3)  Accordingly, the mayor and council find and declare that the purpose of this section is to reduce the number of crimes committed by and against children, and to safeguard the welfare of our children in areas in the city after the hour set out in this section for curfew; it, therefore, enacts a child curfew ordinance as hereinafter set forth in the best interest of the citizens of the city.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 34-46. - Statement of policy. 
                  (a)  The government of the city is firmly committed to providing its employees with a safe work place and promoting high standards of employee health. Consistent with the spirit and intent of this commitment, the mayor and council have established this policy regarding alcohol and substance abuse. The mayor and council's goal will continue to be one of establishing and maintaining a work environment that is free from the effects of alcohol and substance abuse. 
                  (b)  Government has several uniquely compelling interests that justify the implementation of procedures for employee alcohol and substance testing. The public has a right to expect that those who have the responsibility of providing services to taxpayers of the city are at all times both physically and mentally prepared to perform their assigned job duties. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the use of alcohol and certain substances may seriously impair an employee's physical and mental health, and thus, job performance. Where employees participate in alcohol and substance abuse, the integrity of city government and public confidence therein is destroyed. 
                  (c)  The city recognizes that employees have privacy interests and certain privacy rights in their medical condition and treatment. The city respects those interests and rights as long as the privacy of those matters does not impact the safety of the citizens of the city, the safety employees, and the delivery of city services. 
                  (d)  Therefore, in order to ensure the integrity of the city's government and to preserve public trust and confidence, the mayor and council hereby implements an alcohol and substance abuse policy and testing program to detect prohibited alcohol and substance use by city employees and those persons performing services on behalf of the city.

                  Sec. 34-66. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Alcohol means ethyl alcohol, hydrated oxide of ethyl, or spirits of wine, from whatever source or by whatever process produced. For the purpose of this division, the term "alcohol" shall include distilled spirits, beer, malt beverage or fortified wine. 
                  Chain of custody means procedures to account for the integrity of each specimen by tracking its handling and storage from point of specimen collection to fine disposition of the specimen. These procedures shall not be required to negative any possibility of contamination, but shall ensure to a reasonable certainty that the sample remains identifiable and untainted. 
                  Collection site means the facility or location designated by the city (or any alternate site authorized by this division) where individuals present themselves for the purpose of providing a specimen of their blood, breath or urine to be analyzed for the presence of alcohol or substances. 
                  Collection site person means personnel under the direction of the facility or location staff or personnel employed by any alternate collection site authorized by this division, who will instruct and assist individuals at a collection site and who will receive and make an initial examination of the specimen provided by those individuals. A collection site person shall be familiar with the procedures with collection and preservation of samples of bodily substances. 
                  Confirmatory test means a second analytical procedure to identify the presence of a specific substance or metabolite which is independent of the initial test and which may use a different technique and chemical principle from that of the initial test in order to ensure reliability and accuracy. 
                  Controlled substance means those substances as defined in the state Controlled Substances Act (O.C.G.A. § 16-13-20 et seq.). The term "controlled substance" shall include marijuana as defined by O.C.G.A. § 16-13-21. 
                  Department head means the senior person in a department of the city, supervising the activities of that department. 
                  Employee means those individuals who occupy a position in city government or performing services on behalf of any private or corporate entity on behalf of the city. 
                  Initial test (also known as screening test) means an immunoassay screen to eliminate negative specimens from further consideration. 
                  Permanent record book means a book or log in which identifying data on each specimen collected at a collection site is permanently recorded in the sequence of collection. 
                  Reasonable suspicion means that quantity or proof of evidence that is more than a hunch, but less than probable cause. Reasonable suspicion must be based on specific, objective facts and any rationally derived inferences from those facts about the conduct of an individual that would lead a reasonable person to suspect that the individual is or has been using alcohol or controlled substances while on or off duty. 
                  Test, alcohol or substance, means the compulsory production and submission of blood, breath or urine by an employee in accordance with city government procedures for chemical analysis to detect prohibited alcohol and/or substance usage. 
                  (Ord. No. 2002-13, § 33(70-136), 8-19-2002; Ord. No. 2009-04, § 4(70-136), 5-11-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-67. - Alcohol and substance use prohibited. 
                  (a)  Except as hereafter provided, the use, possession, sale, distribution or provision of alcohol or any controlled substance during work time or on the work premises shall be prohibited. This provision shall not apply to employees when such use, possession, sale, distribution or provision of alcohol or any controlled substance is an incident to the employees' lawful duties or is otherwise required in the normal course of their employment. 
                  (b)  Reporting to work or working while under the influence or otherwise impaired by alcohol or any controlled substance shall be prohibited. 
                  (c)  Alcohol or controlled substance-related off-duty use that tends to undermine the reputation, authority or efficiency of the city government is prohibited. 
                  (d)  The use or possession of prescription drugs while on the work premises or while working shall be prohibited unless the prescription container does not have a warning that the contents should not be used when operating equipment or motor vehicles, may cause drowsiness, or any other warning that may describe a reaction to the contents that would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the employee to perform his duties safely and effectively. If such a warning was on the prescription container when filled, then the employee shall ensure that: 
                  (1)  The prescribing physician has been notified of the duties involved with the employee's position and has approved the use of the drug while that employee is performing those duties; and 
                  (2)  The employee's immediate supervisor has been notified in writing by the employee that he is using a prescription drug and that the employee's physician has approved the use of the drug while the employee is at work. 
                  (Ord. No. 2002-13, § 34(70-137), 8-19-2002; Ord. No. 2009-04, § 4(70-137), 5-11-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-68. - Alcohol and/or substance testing. 
                  (a)  Alcohol and/or substance testing may be required of job applicants for positions which deal with public safety; or which require or permit the use of motor vehicles or heavy equipment; or which would pose a threat of bodily harm to the applicant; coworkers or the general public if the applicant was impaired. Whether a particular position comes within the meaning of this section will be determined by the city manager in consultation with the department head, or at the direction of the mayor. At the time applications for any position covered by this section are received, the applicant will be informed that employment is conditional upon alcohol or substance testing. The term "applicant" shall include any current employee of the city that is applying for any position covered by this section as well as any person not a current employee of the city. 
                  (b)  Alcohol and/or substance testing will be required of employees for which reasonable suspicion exists to believe that such employees are under the influence of alcohol or substances during assigned working hours or while otherwise on city property. Testing may be required following work-related accidents if the surrounding circumstances give rise to reasonable suspicion to believe that such employees are under the influence of alcohol or substances. 
                  (1)  The initial determination of whether or not reasonable suspicion exists shall be made by the department head or by the highest ranking supervisory staff person on duty at the time. The department head or supervisory staff person shall consult with the city manager (or city clerk in the absence of the city manager), when available, for the purpose of determining if an alcohol or substance test is appropriate under the circumstances. 
                  (2)  Following the determination that reasonable suspicion exists and an alcohol or substance test should be administered, the employee shall be immediately transported to the collection site by the employee's department head or such designee of the department director. Following the collection procedure, the person transporting the employee shall make appropriate arrangements to transport the employee home. 
                  (3)  Public safety department heads and their designees shall not be required to consult with the city manager prior to making a determination that reasonable suspicion exists, inasmuch as those individuals and their designees have specific training qualifying them to make such determinations. Accordingly, when a public safety department head or designee makes the determination that reasonable suspicion exists, the employee shall be immediately transported to the collection site as is provided hereinabove. 
                  (4)  Any employee tested under this provision may be suspended without pay for up to three days pending the results of the test. If the results of the test are negative, the employee shall return to work with complete restoration of lost salary. 
                  (Ord. No. 2002-13, § 35(70-138), 8-19-2002; Ord. No. 2009-04, § 4(70-138), 5-11-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-69. - Employment action when applicant or employee tests positive. 
                  (a)  Applicants testing positive. Applicants testing positive shall not be employed at that time. Applicants that are denied employment for this reason may reapply for employment after six months from the date of the positive substance test, if meeting all other requirements for application. The fact that the applicant previously had a positive result in a test for drugs or alcohol shall not itself preclude employment with the city but may be considered upon reapplication. 
                  (b)  Employees testing positive. Employees testing positive shall be subject to the following employment action: 
                  (1)  Termination of employment; or 
                  (2)  Suspension without pay. 
                  (c)  Probation. All employees not terminated following a positive test shall be placed on probation for one year following the date of testing. Probationary employees shall be subject to testing without prior notice at irregular intervals throughout the term of the employee's probation. Probationary testing shall be directed by the city manager at the request of the department head. The city manager, in consultation with the department head shall determine the dates of the probationary tests and shall inform the employee when to report for testing. This testing will in no event be more frequent than twice in any given month. The foregoing provision shall not prevent testing that exceeds twice monthly if reasonable suspicion exists for testing. 
                  (d)  Failure to appear for testing. Failure to appear at the designated collection site when directed or other failure to take the test shall subject the employee or applicant to the same sanctions as if the test had been positive or may be considered insubordination.

                  Sec. 34-97. - Drugs and substances tested for. 
                  (a)  Every specimen shall at a minimum be tested for marijuana, amphetamines and cocaine. 
                  (b)  Specimens may be tested for opiates, amphetamines, phencyclidine and alcohol. 
                  (c)  When conducting reasonable suspicion, accident or probationary testing, specimens may be tested for any substance. 
                  (d)  For the purposes of this section, testing shall be deemed to include the authority to test for the metabolites of substances, also. 
                  (Ord. No. 2002-13, § 39(70-151), 8-19-2002; Ord. No. 2009-04, § 6(70-151), 5-11-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-98. - Specimen collection procedures. 
                  The following provisions outline procedures for specimen collection: 
                  (1)  The collection site shall have the personnel and materials necessary to collect specimens and maintain the integrity of them. The site and procedures shall comply with the chain of custody requirements as defined in section 34-66. 
                  (2)  Procedures for collecting urine specimens shall allow individual privacy unless there is reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen provided. 
                  (3)  Collection site personnel shall take reasonable precautions to ensure that a specimen is not adulterated or diluted during the collection procedure, and that information on the specimen bottle and in the record book can identify the individual from whom the specimen was collected. 
                  (4)  After the specimen is collected, it shall be properly sealed and labeled. Markings and documentation of the specimen shall reasonably identify the specimen and date. 
                  (5)  The specimens shall be placed in containers designed to reasonably minimize the possibility of damage during shipment; and those containers shall be securely sealed to reasonably eliminate the possibility of undetected tampering. The containers be marked with the date the specimens were sealed in the containers for shipment. The collection site personnel shall reasonably protect the specimen from adulteration. 
                  (Ord. No. 2002-13, § 40(70-152), 8-19-2002; Ord. No. 2009-04, § 6(70-152), 5-11-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-99. - Laboratory analysis procedures. 
                  The following provisions outline procedures for laboratory analyses: 
                  (1)  Laboratories will use only procedures approved by the National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA). 
                  (2)  The initial test shall use an immunoassay which meets the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for commercial distribution. 
                  (3)  All specimens identified as positive on the initial test shall be confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques. All confirmations shall be by quantitative analysis. Concentrations exceeding the linear region of the standard curve shall be documented in laboratory records as "greater than highest standard curve value." 
                  (4)  Before any test result is reported (the results of initial tests, confirmatory tests or quality control data), it shall be reviewed and the test certified as an accurate report by the responsible individual. The report shall identify the alcohol/substances/metabolites tested for, whether positive or negative, the specimen number assigned by the collection site person and the substance testing laboratory specimen identification number. The results (positive or negative) for all specimens submitted at the same time to the laboratory shall be reported back to the personnel director. 
                  (5)  The city manager shall provide the department head with the results of the test. 
                  (6)  The laboratory shall report as negative all specimens which are negative on the initial test or negative on the confirmatory test. Only specimens confirmed positive shall be reported positive for alcohol or a specific substance. 
                  (7)  City manager may request from the laboratory and the laboratory shall provide quantitation of test results. The laboratory may transmit results to the city manager by various electronic means (e.g., teleprinters, facsimile or computer) in a manner designed to ensure confidentiality of the information. Results may not be provided verbally by telephone. The laboratory must ensure the security of the data transmission and limit access to any data transmission, storage and retrieval system. 
                  (8)  The laboratory shall send to the city manager a copy of the documents relating to a chain of custody attesting to the validity of the test reports. 
                  (9)  Because some analyses deteriorate or are lost during freezing and/or storage, quantitation for a retest is not subject to the specific cutoff requirement but must provide data sufficient to confirm the presence of alcohol or the substance or metabolite. 
                  (10)  The laboratory shall have qualified personnel available to testify in an administrative or disciplinary proceeding against an employee when that proceeding is based on positive results reported by the laboratory. 
                  (11)  The provisions provided for in this article shall not limit the city to the usage of only the standard test described. This section shall not preclude tests for other substances and tests by other valid methodologies. 
                  (Ord. No. 2002-13, § 41(70-153), 8-19-2002; Ord. No. 2009-04, § 6(70-153), 5-11-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-100. - Quality assurance and quality control. 
                  Laboratories performing tests under this division shall have a quality assurance program which encompasses all aspects of the testing process, including, but not limited to, specimen acquisition, chain of custody, security and reporting of results, initial and confirmatory testing, and validation of analytical procedures. Quality assurance procedures shall be designed, implemented and reviewed to monitor the conduct of each step of the process of testing for substances. 
                  (Ord. No. 2002-13, § 42(70-154), 8-19-2002; Ord. No. 2009-04, § 6(70-154), 5-11-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-101. - Reporting and review of results. 
                  (a)  Review by city manager, department head and trained medical personnel. The city manager shall review results in concert with the department head. An essential part of the substance testing program is the final review of results. A positive test result does not automatically identify an employee/applicant as an unauthorized alcohol or substance user. An individual with a detailed knowledge of possible alternate medical explanations is essential to the review of results. This review shall be performed in collaboration with trained medical personnel. 
                  (b)  Discussion of positive results with individual; assessment of disciplinary action. Prior to making a final decision to verify a positive test result, the city manager with the department head shall give the individual an opportunity to discuss the test results. Following verification of positive test results, and in the absence of an appropriate alternate medical explanation, the department director shall assess appropriate disciplinary action against the employee. 
                  (c)  Reanalysis of samples. Should any question arise as to the accuracy or validity of positive test results, the department head, in consultation with the city manager, is authorized to order a reanalysis of the original sample and such retests are authorized only at laboratories certified under these guidelines. 
                  (d)  Certification of legitimate substance use. If the laboratory determines there is a legitimate medical explanation for the positive test results, it shall be certified that the results are consistent with authorized substance use and take no further action. If, however, the substance may impair the performance or safety of the employee or others, the department head is authorized to take appropriate action to eliminate any impairment of performance or safety concerns, not including disciplinary action. 
                  (e)  Action upon determination of scientifically insufficient results. Additionally, the laboratory, based on a review inspection report, quality control data, multiple samples and other pertinent results, may determine that the results are scientifically insufficient for further action and declare the test specimen negative. In this situation, the head, in consultation with the city manager, may require reanalysis of the original sample specimen before making this decision. The reanalysis may be performed by the same laboratory, or a portion of the original specimen may be sent for reanalysis to alternate laboratory. The laboratory shall assist in this review process as requested by making available the individual responsible for day-to-day management of the substance testing laboratory or other employee who is a forensic toxicologist or who has equivalent forensic experience in substance testing to provide specific consultation as required by the city. The laboratory shall report to the city manager, who shall forward to the department head, all findings and the scientific basis therefor.

                  Sec. 34-102. - Alcohol testing. 
                  (a)  When reasonable cause exists to believe that an employee is under the influence of alcohol, the following procedure for testing shall be employed: 
                  (1)  The supervisor or other such person forming such reasonable belief shall immediately report the same to the department head. 
                  (2)  The department head or his supervisor shall confer with the city manager as to the existence of a reasonable belief. For the reasons stated above, this provision shall not apply to public safety employees. 
                  (3)  The employee shall be directed to submit to a test of his breath as soon as practicable after a determination of reasonable belief is made. 
                  (4)  The testing of the employee's breath shall be performed on a device approved for breath testing pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 40-6-392, or approved for preliminary breath testing by the state department of public safety, the International Association of Chiefs of Police or the city police chief. 
                  (5)  No less than two samples of the employee's breath shall be taken. If the testing device produces a printed test result, a copy of the same shall be provided to the employee. If there is no printed result, the results displayed on the device shall be shown to the employee and provided to the employee in writing, together with the time the samples were taken. 
                  (b)  If the higher of the test results is .010 gms/ percent or higher, the employee shall not be returned to duty and shall be relieved from duty without pay for the remainder of the work day. If the higher test result is .020 gms/ percent or greater, the employee shall be relieved of duty and the city manager notified. 
                  (c)  Failure or refusal to submit to breath testing when directed to by a proper authority shall subject the employee to disciplinary action.

                  Sec. 34-105. - Criminal prosecution. 
                  Nothing in this article shall preclude prosecution for any offense defined by state law or city ordinance. Nothing in this article shall prohibit city law enforcement employees electing to follow a procedure prescribed by state law instead of that set out hereinabove in testing city employees for drugs or alcohol.

                  Sec. 34-124. - Implementation. 
                  The reference point and clearinghouse for the employee assistance program (EAP) will be the county's personnel department. The EAP must have proper resources to interview employees and refer them to appropriate rehabilitation/treatment programs.

                  Sec. 34-125. - Confidentiality. 
                  The confidentiality of the records of the employee assistance program (EAP) coordinator will be ensured to further promote employee trust and confidence in the EAP. For the purposes of statistical reporting, names and dates will not be released. However, the EAP coordinator shall have the obligation to advise the department director (elected official) if such employee admits to be presently impaired. The notion of confidentiality does not give an impaired employee the right to continue working simply because he has accessed the EAP. In such a situation, the department director (elected official) may relieve the employee from work duty, and the employee may seek appropriate leave benefits or some other type of action that will not label the employee as an alcohol or substance abuser.

                  Sec. 34-126. - Supervisor referral. 
                  The alcohol and controlled substance abuse policy allows the department director (elected official) to refer an employee to the employee assistance program (EAP) rather than suspend or terminate the employee for a violation of the policy. All referrals to the EAP will be coordinated through the personnel department. After a decision to refer the employee to the EAP has been made, the employee shall be counseled by the department director (elected official) in concert with the personnel director. At this counseling session, the policy shall be reviewed with the employee, and the employee shall sign the employee consent and notice of referral form. The counseling session should further provide the opportunity to review the EAP expectations and all other available alternatives to participation in the EAP.

                  Sec. 34-127. - Financing. 
                  Subject to approval by the board of commissioners, an outside employee assistance program (EAP) professional organization may be retained as the EAP coordinator. All expenses incident to services rendered by the EAP coordinator shall be the sole responsibility of the employee referred to the EAP. However, the county will cooperate with the employee relative to the filing of appropriate claims with the employee's health insurance provider.

                  ARTICLE IV. - SEXUAL HARASSMENT 

                  Sec. 34-155. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to adopt a sexual harassment policy and to provide the procedure within which the objectives of this policy can be accomplished. Accordingly, pursuant to the guidelines of sex discrimination issued by the equal employment opportunity commission, the board of commissioners endorses the following policy. 
                  (Ord. No. 2002-13, § 55(70-196), 8-19-2002) 
                  Sec. 34-156. - Policy statement. 
                  The following provisions shall constitute the county's policy regarding sexual harassment: 
                  (1)  It is illegal and against the policies of the county for any employee, male or female, to sexually harass another employee by: 
                  a.  Making unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature a condition of an employee's continued employment. 
                  b.  Making submission to or rejections of such conduct the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee. 
                  c.  Discriminating against an employee because of his sex. 
                  Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 
                  (2)  No person shall threaten or insinuate, either explicitly or implicitly, that an employee's refusal to submit to sexual advances will adversely affect the employee's employment, evaluation, wages, advancement, assigned duties, shifts or any other condition of employment or career development. 
                  (3)  It is the responsibility of each supervisor, department director and elected official having adopted this policy to maintain the workplace free of sexual harassment. This duty includes discussing this policy with all employees and assuring them that they are not to endure insulting, degrading or exploitive sexual treatment. 
                  (4)  Any employee who believes he has been the subject of sexual harassment should report the alleged act immediately to his supervisor, department director, elected official or the director of personnel. Any supervisor, department director or elected official who becomes aware of or suspects sexual harassment shall immediately report such information to the director of personnel. Upon receiving a complaint, an investigation shall be undertaken immediately by the department/office in conjunction with the personnel office. Any employee who has been found after appropriate investigation to have sexually harassed another employee will be subject to disciplinary action by his department director or elected official from a written warning up to and including termination. 
                  (5)  It is recognized that the question of whether a particular action or incident is a purely personal, social relationship without discriminatory employment effect requires a factual determination based on all facts pertaining to the incident. Given the nature of this type of discrimination, it is further recognized that false accusations of sexual harassment can cause serious effects on innocent women and men. Accordingly, false accusations will result in severe disciplinary action up to and including termination. The county trusts that all employees will continue to act responsibly to establish a pleasant working environment free of sexual harassment.

The approval of the city or its designee, including the county traffic engineer, shall be obtained before installation of such lights. 
                  (c)  Other lighting fixtures to be installed within or outside of public rights-of-way for whatever purpose shall be installed and operated in such a manner as to prevent glare from being a hazard to, or interfering with, the normal use of the public rights-of-way.

                  Sec. 36-99. - Purpose. 
                  In response to an increasing number of complaints regarding speeding problems in residential neighborhoods, the city and its designee, including the county department of transportation (the department), has studied available alternatives and methods employed by other similarly situated communities and how effectively and successfully those communities have addressed residential speeding problems. The installation of speed humps was found to be a popular and relatively cost effective measure in reducing average speeds. When properly designed and installed, and with strong majority community backing and support, speed humps were found to be effective at reducing speeds in neighborhoods. After much experimenting and testing, including testing on city and county roads, the use of speed humps has been widely endorsed by transportation authorities. In the United States, a policy on the use of speed humps has been developed by a special committee of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). As a result of these preliminary efforts, the following procedures have been established for groups of citizens in the city who want to pursue the installation of speed humps in their neighborhoods.

                  Sec. 36-101. - Request for study; public hearing. 
                  An authorized officer of an organized homeowners association or the majority of homeowners within a neighborhood may, through an informal petition or letter, request that a neighborhood be studied for speed hump installation. The letter or petition must demonstrate that the desires of a majority of the property owners in that neighborhood are represented. The results of the neighborhood traffic speed study may be directed to the neighborhood representative by certified mail or, upon request, will be presented by the city or its designee to a neighborhood at a public hearing organized, arranged, and publicized by the neighborhood group along with a general presentation on speed humps. All property owners in the neighborhood shall be notified by an authorized representative of the neighborhood group of the time and place of the public hearing.

                  Sec. 36-102. - Petition for installation—Preparation. 
                  A formal petition in such form as prescribed by the city or its designee shall be filed requesting that one or more speed humps be installed within a neighborhood. All property owners in the neighborhood shall be notified by an authorized representative of the neighborhood group and afforded an opportunity to sign the petition. Each property owner shall indicate his preference for the installation of neighborhood speed humps by marking a "YES" or "NO" on the petition. If more than one person owns the property, all parties shall sign the petition individually to be counted. Renting tenants are not an acceptable substitute for the legal property owner and may not sign petitions as related to this program. No valid signature will be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with the city. Each person signing the petition shall sign before a witness who shall be available to verify the signature of a property owner.

                  At least 75 percent of the property owners in a neighborhood must indicate an affirmative preference for speed humps before a petition will be considered by the city. The percentages shall be calculated by dividing the total number of property owners by the total number of property owners indicating an affirmative preference. For the purposes of determining the number of property owners in the neighborhood, the geographical boundaries of the neighborhood shall be established using the database of applicable taxing authorities. In the event a neighborhood is not completely built out, a minimum of 30 percent of the total number of residences must be occupied before a petition for the installation of speed humps will be considered. The completed petition must state the name and address of the representative of the neighborhood group, it must be signed by the representative before a notary public and returned to the department where it will be checked against property tax records to ensure that all requirements are met. Those petitions failing to meet specified requirements will be returned to the representative for compliance. Petitions meeting all requirements will be presented for approval or disapproval by the mayor and council.

                  (a)  The geometric design of speed humps has been proven to be a critical factor in terms of their safety and effectiveness in lowering speeds. Based on extensive research, speed humps shall be constructed with the following specifications: Four inches maximum vertical rise, 22 feet in horizontal length, and incline-flattop-decline. 
                  (b)  Each individual speed hump location shall require posting of standard warning signs that will be installed along the back of the curb within the city-owned rights-of-way.

                  The city may remove speed humps under the following conditions: 
                  (1)  A formal petition in the form as prescribed in section 36-102 shall be filed with the city indicating that 75 percent of the property owners request the removal of the speed humps; 
                  (2)  The petition shall contain a statement acknowledging that the property owners are aware of the probability that vehicular traffic speeds within the neighborhood may increase after the speed humps are removed; 
                  (3)  The speed humps shall not have been installed less than one year from the date of receipt of the petition; and 
                  (4)  All costs associated with the initial installation and removal of the speed humps, as determined and itemized by the city or its designee, shall have been paid.

                  All property owners in a petitioning neighborhood shall pay for the installation and maintenance of the speed humps. The annual charge associated with the initial installation, maintenance, and repair of speed humps shall be as established by the city and amendable by resolution. The charge associated with the removal of speed humps shall be at a level that adequately covers the cost of removal as determined by the city or its designee.

                  The charges for installation, maintenance, and removal of speed humps shall be in the form of an assessment against the property and shall be itemized as a separate entry, and added annually to each property owner's property tax statement. The assessment shall constitute a lien upon the property and have the same priority as an ad valorem tax lien.

                  It is the intent of this article to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the traveling public in the city by providing the means by which personalty of dispossessed tenants will be removed from the city's right-of-way if otherwise left thereon for an unreasonable period of time.

                  Upon the receipt of a writ of possession issued by a court for execution, local law enforcement officials shall inquire of the property owner or his agent, if any (landlord), if, in addition to placing the landlord in possession of the premises, the landlord desires the personalty of the tenant be removed to the city's right-of-way. If the answer is in the affirmative, the sheriff shall require evidence that the landlord has posted a cash bond with the city or its designee in the amount established by the city and amendable by resolution.

                  In the event the personalty of a dispossessed tenant remains on the city's right-of-way for a period of 24 hours, the landlord, at his own expense, shall cause the personalty to be removed from the city's right-of-way. In the event the landlord fails to remove the personalty within the time prescribed, the county may cause such personalty to be removed to the county landfill, and thereafter assert a claim against the landlord's bond to the extent of moving and disposal expenses. In the further event the landlord's bond is not sufficient to cover the expenses associated with the removal and disposal of the personalty, such lien may be claimed against the realty of the landlord, and thereafter foreclosed in the same manner as special liens on real estate by laborers in accordance with applicable state laws.

                  Property which has been set on the right-of-way of the city and remains there for a period in excess of 24 hours shall be presumed abandoned unless prior arrangements for claiming the property by the owner, his heirs or assigns has been received by the city or its designee, including the county department of refuse control.

                  (a)  Whenever it is brought to the attention of the city that abandoned property as provided in section 36-132 exists on the right-of-way, the city or its designee shall attempt to ascertain the name, address, and telephone number of the owner of the property. If such information is known, the owner of the property shall be contacted and advised to immediately abate the hazard by removing the property from the right-of-way. 
                  (b)  In the event the personalty of a dispossessed tenant is set on the city's right-of-way at the insistence of the landlord, and such property thereafter is presumed abandoned, the landlord, at his own expense, shall cause the personalty to be removed from the city's right-of-way in accordance with provisions of section 36-130. 
                  (c)  If the owner of the abandoned property cannot be located or attempts to contact such owner has failed, and the landlord, if applicable, fails to remove the abandoned property, the city may abate the hazard without the prior approval of the property owner. The city or its designee, including the county department of refuse control, is authorized to use work crews, private contractors, or any inmate labor to abate the hazard by removing the abandoned property to a landfill in accordance with provisions of section 36-130.

The customer who pays a rental charge that is subject to this tax levied shall be liable for the tax. The tax shall be paid by the customer to the rental motor vehicle concern. The tax shall be a debt of the customer to the rental motor vehicle concern until it is paid and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as authorized for the recovery of other debts. The rental motor vehicle concern collecting the tax shall remit the tax to the city, and the tax remitted shall be a credit against the tax imposed on the rental motor vehicle concern. Every rental motor vehicle concern subject to this tax levied shall be liable for the tax at the applicable rate on the charges actually collected or the amount of taxes collected from the customers, whichever is greater. 
                  (b)  The mayor and council hereby declares that the proceeds of the tax are to be expended and shall apply in each fiscal year during which the tax is collected for capital outlay projects pertaining to the construction of the city's parks and recreational facilities, and maintenance and operation expenses associated with such recreational facilities. 
                  (c)  The tax levied pursuant to this section shall terminate not later than December 31, 2038.

At the time of annual registration, the business or practitioner with a location or office situated in more than one jurisdiction shall provide the city the following: 
                  (1)  Financial information necessary to allocate the gross receipts of the business or practitioner among the jurisdictions in which the business or practitioner has a location or office; and

                  (b)  In the case of a business or profession subject to occupation tax for a calendar year, which business or profession was not conducted for any period of time in the corporate limits of the city in the preceding calendar year, the owner, proprietor, manager, or executive officer of the business or profession liable for occupation tax shall estimate the gross volume of revenue from commencing date to the end of the calendar year and such tax shall be paid in advance of a tax certificate being issued. The following year, the actual amount of gross receipts for such part of the prior calendar year shall be reported in the return, and further payment made or refund provided as appropriate according to the other provisions of this article. Said return shall also show a figure putting the actual receipts for such part of the prior year on an annual basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part year bears to the whole year. Said figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business tax liability. 
                  (c)  The owner, proprietor, manager, or executive officer of the business subject to said occupation tax of the current calendar year shall, at the end of the preceding year, and on or before February 10 of the current calendar year, file with the occupation tax clerk of the city, on a form furnished by said officer, a signed return setting forth the amount of actual gross receipts of such business for the entire preceding calendar year, said return to include attached documentation to support said amount.

In the case of practitioners of professions and occupations, the city shall be sensitive to the issues of client or customer confidentiality. In such cases, the practitioner may redact information claimed to be privileged before disclosing books or records of financial transactions. If such practitioner alleges that redaction provides inadequate protection to the confidences of his clients or customers, such practitioner may petition the county superior court for an in camera inspection, prior to examination by the tax clerk. Except for practitioners of professions and occupations electing to pay a flat fee in lieu of a gross receipts tax, adequate records shall be kept in the city, for examination by the occupation tax clerk at that officer's discretion.

In the case of those practitioners where the local government cannot suspend the right of the practitioner to practice their profession, the imposition of civil penalties may be permitted and pursued by the local government in the case of delinquent occupation tax. 
                  (b)  Any person, his manager, agent, or employee, who does business in the city after the tax for said business becomes delinquent (except for practitioners of professions and occupations), or who is required to make occupation tax returns, and who fails to make said returns within the time and in the manner herein provided, or who refuses to amend any such practice law, only after delinquency of tax payment has occurred, and for all other taxpayers when a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the occupation tax clerk against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. Practitioners of professions and occupations shall be allowed to continue to practice their professions without the collection of any fees and charges due. If at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may request a refund of any fees and charges paid by him as a result of the default as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

The issuance of an occupation tax registration to any business shall not authorize that business to violate any regulation, ordinance, or law of the city, the state, or the United States, nor shall an occupation tax registration relieve any business from any requirement to obtain any license or permit or pay any tax otherwise required by ordinance, regulation or law, including, but not limited to, alcoholic beverage taxes and fees and hotel/motel taxes and fees. 
                  (b)  No business or occupational license or permit may be renewed if property taxes for the address upon which the business or occupation is operated within the city are delinquent.

                  ARTICLE II. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

                  Sec. 42-19. - Findings. 
                  The mayor and council of the city make the following findings: 
                  (1)  Stormwater management is needed throughout the city. While specific service and system demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (2)  Addressing the stormwater management needs in the city is essential to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and systems results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways. 
                  (3)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff can result in flooding, streambank and ditch erosion, property damage and degradation of water quality, aquatic habitat and biological communities. Failure to manage these impacts can put the city's ability to receive state and federal grants and permits at risk. 
                  (4)  The volume and quantity of stormwater generated by a development has been proven to be most closely associated with the amount of impervious surface on the property, therefore, the square footage of impervious surface is the most appropriate factor for calculating stormwater utility fees. 
                  (5)  The city and the county presently own and operate stormwater management systems which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by these entities, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the entities to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems in concert with the management of other water resources. In order to do so, there must be adequate and stable funding for the stormwater management program's operating needs and capital. 
                  (6)  The feasibility report submitted to the city, the county, and the county water authority (hereinafter CCWA) properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the stormwater utility. 
                  (7)  As a result, the mayor and council of the city find that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and the mayor and council of the city finds that a utility fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 2006-02, pt. 1, art. 1, § 1, 2006) 
                  Sec. 42-20. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Credit means a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. The basis of such credits, if granted, will be defined by a specific written agreement at the determination of the stormwater official in accordance with the stormwater utility. 
                  Customer means all persons or entities to whom the stormwater service charge is billed. 
                  Detached dwelling unit means developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar nonresidential uses. The term "detached dwelling unit" shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
                  Developed land means real property which has been altered from its natural state by addition of any improvements, such as grading, paving, compaction, construction of structures or impervious surfaces greater than 200 square feet, or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped conditions. For new construction, property shall be considered developed pursuant to this article upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or upon completion of construction or final inspection if no such certificate is issued. 
                  Hydrologic response of a property means the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors, including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property. 
                  Impervious surfaces means those areas, which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. The following types of surfaces will be considered impervious surfaces for the purposes of the stormwater utility: the projected area of buildings; asphalt, concrete, brick, or stone-paved areas; improved vehicular drives and parking areas; compacted gravel and soil surfaces; fabric or plastic coverings; and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development. 
                  Multifamily residential means developed land where more than one attached or detached residential dwelling units are located, including, but not limited to, apartment houses, condominiums, townhomes, attached single-family homes, boardinghouses, group homes, hotels and motels, retirement centers, and other structures in which more than one family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. 
                  Service charges means the stormwater management service charges applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by CCWA stormwater utility. The charge shall be used to fund the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and systems. Service charges are based on measurable parameters that influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes of similarly situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced level of stormwater services above those normally provided by CCWA. 
                  Single-family residential means a developed lot containing one dwelling structure with its principal use being residential. 
                  Stormwater development guidelines means those guidelines established by CCWA which specify approved design criteria, construction materials and construction methods for components of the stormwater management system. 
                  Stormwater management system means any one or more of the various devices used in the collection, treatment, or conveyance of storm, flood or surface drainage waters, including all manmade structures or natural watercourse for the conveyance or transportation of runoff, such as: detention areas, lakes, berms, swales, improved watercourses, open channels, streams, culverts, pipes, catch basins inlets; collection, or drainage. 
                  Stormwater official means the CCWA general manager or his appointee that has direct responsibility for the management of the CCWA stormwater utility. 
                  Stormwater unit (SU) means the unit of measure which provides the basis for comparing the runoff generated by customer's developed land with that generated by another's. An SU shall be the average impervious coverage of a statistical sampling of single-family residential lots in the city. A stormwater unit has been determined through engineering and analysis to be 2,950 square feet of impervious surface. This unit will be used to determine and compute the service charge for all developed land served by the CCWA stormwater utility. 
                  Stormwater Utility Guidebook means the document that defines the basis for the stormwater utility, policies and procedures for operating the utility, and other necessary information determined to help document how the utility was developed and how it is operated. 
                  Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures in excess of 200 square feet which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state.

                  Sec. 42-26. - Credits. 
                  (a)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to CCWA standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems. 
                  (b)  Property owners of developed land may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The specific credits will be determined based on the guidelines in the Stormwater Utility Guidebook.

Notice, as required under this provision, shall not be required: 
                  (1)  When the stormwater official determines that the public nuisance presents an imminent endangerment to persons or property; 
                  (2)  When a notice of violation has been sent to the same property owner or owners for the same violation within the previous three months; or 
                  (3)  When notice by certified mail cannot be affected on the owners of record.

                  b.  Within the reasonable period of time for compliance specified in the notice of violation, the property owner shall either abate the nuisance or file a written request with CCWA for a hearing before the stormwater official to show that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such condition does not constitute a public nuisance in violation of the ordinance. 
                  (c)  Any failure to meet the obligation set forth in this section shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the CCWA may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner or developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. From the date of the filing of such action, the CCWA shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the county superior court or city court. CCWA shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to ensure compliance with this section.

                  (1)  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline of streets or highways, street lines, or highway right-of-way lines, such lines shall be construed to be district boundaries; provided, however, that where known, right-of-way lines shall be construed to be district boundaries and the centerlines shall be construed as the district boundaries only when the zoning administrator cannot make a determination as to the right-of-way lines. 
                  (2)  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries. 
                  (3)  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways or railroads, or rights-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the official zoning map; provided, however, that where known, right-of-way lines or dimensions exist, the right-of-way lines shall be so used only when the zoning administrator cannot make a determination as to the centerlines. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on said official zoning map. 
                  (4)  Where a district boundary line as appearing on the official zoning map divides a lot in single ownership at the time of enactment of the ordinance from which this appendix is derived, the district requirements for the least restricted portion of such lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided that such extension shall not include any part of such a lot more than 35 feet beyond the district boundary line. 
                  (5)  In the case of a through lot fronting on two approximately parallel streets that is divided by a zoning district boundary line paralleling the streets, the restrictions of the zoning district in which each frontage of the through lots lies shall apply to that portion of the through lot. 
                  (6)  Where zoning district boundaries are in doubt, the zoning administrator or his designee shall make such interpretation using the appropriate scale from the official zoning map. 
                  (7)  The zoning administrator may utilize the minutes and such other records as may be available to interpret the zoning map when boundary lines may be in doubt.

                  ARTICLE VI. - NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES, LAND AND USES 
                  Within the zoning districts established by this appendix or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures or uses of land and structures which were lawful before this appendix was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this appendix or future amendment. It is the intent of this appendix to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this appendix that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
                  Nonconforming uses are declared by this appendix to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this appendix. 
                  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this appendix shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building or lot on which a grading permit, building permit or certification of zoning compliance was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of adoption of this appendix unless actual construction was not begun within 180 days of the issuance of said permit or certification. However, if the zoning administrator determines that such changes will not work an undue hardship on the owner, developer or builder and are necessary to protect the health, safety and/or public welfare, then the zoning administrator may require changes in said plans. 

                  Sec. 600. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
                  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory building may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this appendix, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this appendix. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lots shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. 
                  If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this appendix, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this appendix, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this appendix, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area less than the requirements stated in this appendix. 
                  Sec. 601. - Nonconforming uses of land (or land with minor structures only). 
                  Where at the time of passage of this appendix lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this appendix, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding $1,000.00, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
                  (1)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this appendix. 
                  (2)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this appendix. 
                  (3)  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 120 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this appendix for the district in which such land is located. 
                  (4)  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this appendix shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
                  Sec. 602. - Nonconforming structures. 
                  Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this appendix is derived which could not be built under the terms of this appendix due to restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
                  (1)  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its degree of nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its degree of nonconformity. 
                  (2)  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this appendix. 
                  (3)  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
                  Sec. 603. - Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and land in combination. 
                  If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000.00 or more, or of structure and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this appendix, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
                  (1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this appendix in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
                  (2)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this appendix, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
                  (3)  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the city council may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this appendix. 
                  (4)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
                  (5)  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
                  (6)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. The term "destruction," for the purpose of this subsection, is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at time of destruction. 
                  Sec. 604. - Repairs and maintenance. 
                  (a)  For any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
                  (b)  If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
                  (c)  Nothing in this appendix shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
                  Sec. 605. - Amortization and discontinuance. 
                  There are found to be certain uses of land, buildings and structures which have an adverse effect on the carrying out of the land use plan, and which can be discontinued after a reasonable time irrespective of aforementioned rules as to nonconforming uses. The following uses shall be removed or made conforming within the specified amortization period. Said amortization period shall commence upon the effective date of the ordinance from which this appendix is derived. 
                  (1)  Fences, walls and foliage which constitute a hazard by virtue of impairing sight distances at a curve or intersection shall be made conforming within 90 days.

                  ARTICLE IX. - SPECIAL PROVISIONS 

                  Sec. 901. - Landscaping and buffer areas. 
                  901.1.  Purpose. It is recognized that the adjacent location of certain land uses may create an incompatible situation that can be mitigated by the installation of a planted buffer. An incompatible situation can arise due to the location of commercial or industrial uses adjacent to residentially zoned land, or to a lesser extent due to location of mobile home parks or multiple-family residences adjacent to single-family residential districts. 
                  Therefore, when land is to be developed for a use creating an incompatible situation, or when a use deemed incompatible is modified or expanded, a buffer shall be, provided along all side and rear property lines to insulate adjacent properties from adverse impacts. The required buffer shall provide necessary visual privacy for the conduct of residential lifestyles in an undisturbed environment, and shall provide for the protection and preservation of property values in residential districts. 
                  901.2.  Situations requiring buffers. The following situations constitute creation of incompatibilities and are subject to buffer requirements of this appendix: 
                  (1)  The location of commercial or industrial land use directly adjacent to residentially zoned land. 
                  (2)  The location of mobile home parks, duplex developments or multiple-family developments directly adjacent to land zoned for single-family residences. 
                  The city council or zoning administrator may require a buffer between other districts or land uses when it is determined that an incompatible situation exists or may occur as a result of a development activity. 
                  901.3.  General requirements. Buffers shall be established and maintained by the owner of the property containing the incompatible land use. The determination of incompatibility shall be based upon the existing character of the area in which the proposed action takes place. For example, proposed development or modification of commercial or industrial land use adjacent to an area developed as residential shall require the owner of the commercial or industrial property to install and maintain the buffer. If, however, nonresidentially zoned land is rezoned for development of residences and this property is located adjacent to land developed as or zoned for nonresidential use, the owner of the property to be rezoned for residences shall be required to install and maintain the buffer. 
                  The requirements for buffers are as follows: 
                  (1)  Where commercial or industrial land uses are contiguous with land zoned for single-family residential use, the minimum width of the required buffer shall be 50 feet. 
                  (2)  Where commercial or industrial land uses are contiguous with land zoned for mobile home parks, duplexes or multiple-family residences, the minimum width of the required buffer shall be 25 feet. 
                  (3)  Where mobile home parks, duplexes or multiple-family land uses are contiguous with land zoned for single-family residences, the minimum width of the required buffer shall be 50 feet. 
                  (4)  The minimum width of the required buffer for sanitary landfills shall be 100 feet. 
                  (5)  Any new airport shall have a 3,000-foot buffer area around the entire periphery of the airport. This buffer area is to consist of natural vegetation. However, if a portion of this buffer area is void or vacant of adequate vegetation, then this area is to be planted to match the highest natural vegetation in the 3,000-foot area. 
                  In all other instances, the minimum width of a buffer as determined by the city council shall not be less than 25 feet. Vegetation attaining a minimum height in excess of that required herein might be required to mitigate the impacts of certain projects. 
                  The required buffer can be incorporated into the yard setback as specified in the appropriate zoning district. 
                  Where a buffer is required, the zoning administrator or city engineer shall evaluate the existing vegetative and topographic conditions, development and zoning to make a determination as to whether a natural buffer or planted buffer is to be required. If the zoning administrator or city engineer determine that the existing vegetation in the area where the buffer is required is of sufficient height, density and width as to accomplish the aforementioned purpose of the buffer and substantially comply with the buffer specifications stated herein, then the zoning administrator or city engineer may require a natural buffer. However, if the zoning administrator or city engineer determine that the existing or natural vegetation is not sufficient, then a planted buffer (possibly including fence, earth berm or similar such barrier) may be required. 
                  Once the developer/property owner has staked the natural buffer or, in the case of the planted buffer, installed the buffer and the city engineer has approved the buffer, then this buffer is to be considered to be an undisturbed buffer. Minor maintenance or development activity (such as a drainage easement, sewer line connection, etc.) may be authorized by the zoning administrator or city engineer upon request. 
                  No area in which a buffer is required by this appendix shall be disturbed without first obtaining approval from either the zoning administrator or city engineer. 
                  901.4.  Minimum specifications. The following are minimum specifications for required buffers. Buffers shall: 
                  (1)  Be depicted in detail (the type and location of natural and planted vegetation are to be illustrated) on each site plan or plat prior to approval, and shall be designated as a permanent buffer. 
                  (2)  Not be disturbed by grading, property improvements or construction activities except where necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin such natural growth, where too dense to permit normal growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen, or dangerous and decayed timbers. Any contemplated disturbance shall first be brought to the attention of the zoning administrator or city engineer and formal approval secured prior to initiating activity within required buffer areas. 
                  (3)  Utilize existing vegetation in an undisturbed state where it has been determined that existing vegetation is appropriate for inclusion within the buffer strip, or when required shall be supplemented with approved, additional planting. 
                  (4)  Retain the natural topography of the land, except when a portion must be cleared and graded as required by the local law to prevent soil erosion or sedimentation. 
                  (5)  Be completely installed in accordance with the approved plan prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
                  (6)  Not be used for temporary or permanent parking or loading, other than for provision of drainage improvements as mandated by local law, or for a structure other than a fence. 
                  (7)  Attain a minimum height of six feet within three years of the planting date. 
                  (8)  Be subject to plan approval by the zoning administrator or city engineer prior to installation of a planted buffer. 
                  901.5.  Buffer composition. In those instances where the natural vegetation and topography are insufficient to achieve the desired level of screening as determined by the zoning administrator or city engineer, a planted buffer shall be provided and shall consist of plant material of such growth characteristics as will provide an acoustical and visual screen. The following plants are suggested for use as part of the screening buffer: 
                  (1)  Trees. 
                  Yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria). 
                  American holly (Ilex opaca). 
                  Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana). 
                  Laurel cherry (Prunus caroliniana). 
                  Arizona cypress redbay (Persea bordonia). 
                  Virginia pine. 
                  (2)  Shrubs. 
                  Cleyera (Cleyera japonica). 
                  Euonymus (Euonymus.japonicus). 
                  Japanese privet (Ligustrum japonica). 
                  California privet (Ligustrum). 
                  European privet (Ligustrum vulgare). 
                  Southern wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera). 
                  Northern bayberry (Myrica Pennsylvania). 
                  Pittosporum (Pittosporum tobira). 
                  Japan yew (Podocarpus macro phyuus). 
                  Red tip (Photinia). 
                  (3)  Ground cover. 
                  Shore juniper (Juniperus contorta). 
                  Periwinkle (Vince minor). 
                  Lippia (Lippia nodiflora). 
                  Evergreen candyturf (Iberis sempervirens). 
                  Other evergreen plant materials having the same growth characteristics as the aforementioned may be substituted subject to approval by the zoning administrator or city engineer prior to installation. 
                  901.6.  Maintenance. The buffer required by this appendix shall be guaranteed for the duration of the incompatible land use, or until such use changes to a compatible type. Necessary trimming and maintenance shall be performed to maintain the health of the plant materials, to provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance, and to ensure that the buffer serves the purpose for which it was intended. 
                  901.7.  Exceptions. The zoning administrator and/or the director of transportation and development may grant a reduction in the size of the required buffer by up to 50 percent, provided a barrier of at least eight feet in height is provided in the form of: 
                  (1)  A solid wooden fence; or 
                  (2)  An earthen berm; or 
                  (3)  A combination of a solid wooden fence and earthen berm. 
                  Plans for this barrier must be submitted and approved by the zoning administrator or the director of transportation and development prior to granting of the exception. 
                  In unique situations, the zoning administrator or director of transportation and development may grant further reductions in the size of the required buffer down to zero feet. Examples of such unique situations include, but are not limited to, the following: 
                  (1)  A substantial topographic difference between the adjacent land uses. This difference must be of such magnitude as to make a buffer and/or fence impractical. 
                  (2)  Both properties have substantial frontage along major roadways, the area is changing its development character, and the residential use is unlikely to remain as such for the anticipated life of a buffer (at least ten years). 
                  (3)  The residential use is nonconforming and/or deteriorating. 
                  (4)  The commercial/industrial site is already developed. 
                  The zoning administrator and/or director of transportation and development may establish such conditions for granting approval of the buffer reduction as the situation warrants to achieve the intent of this appendix. 
                  At least seven days before such a decision shall be made, the subject property shall have a sign posted thereupon inviting comments on the proposal. 
                  Sec. 902. - Screening. 
                  Certain uses such as junk or salvage yard operations and other commercial and industrial operations requiring the storage of inoperative equipment or vehicles for prolonged periods of time could present unsightly views or health hazards. To preclude this from occurring, the zoning administrator shall require owners of such properties to completely enclose such operations by a fence which completely obscures views of the property from adjacent sidewalks and streets, built to a height greater than that of the height of the highest piece of equipment or vehicle stored on the property, provided that no fence shall be less than eight feet nor more than 20 feet in height when measured from the crown of the adjacent streets. Such fences shall be constructed of solid materials. Construction of cyclone fencing which utilizes metal inserts as screening shall be prohibited. Fencing along street frontages shall be located not closer than 90 feet from the centerline of the adjacent street. Uses existing at the date of adoption of this appendix shall have six months to come into compliance. 
                  Many operations which involve the stacking of inoperative or obsolete equipment or vehicles pose a direct health hazard to the public. The city council shall require all such operations to submit to annual inspection by the Clayton County Board of Health. The results of such inspections shall be delivered to the city council for review. If a business fails to pass such inspection, it shall have 30 days to comply or it shall cease operations until such time that compliance is effected. 
                  Sec. 903. - Mobile home parks. 
                  Mobile home parks shall comply with the following requirements: 
                  (1)  A site plan shall be submitted to and approved by the zoning administrator prior to development or expansion as, provided in articles XI and XII of this appendix. No mobile homes shall be placed in the new area of an existing park or a new park until the final site plan is approved by the zoning administrator. 
                  (2)  The minimum space limits and setback requirements shall be as set forth in section 811 of this appendix. 
                  (3)  The maximum overall mobile home park density shall not exceed five units per gross acre. 
                  (4)  No additions shall be made to a mobile home park or mobile home that will violate setback requirements. All additions shall be approved by the building inspector and zoning administrator. 
                  (5)  Each mobile home unit shall be installed on a concrete block foundation, of which the base block shall be solid and equal in size to the pier block size (a minimum of eight inches by eight inches by 16 inches).

                  Sec. 905. - Parking and loading. 
                  905.1.  Purpose. It is the intent of this appendix that all buildings, structures and uses of land shall provide off-street parking and loading space in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the building or use of land and that such parking and loading spaces be so oriented that they are in fact readily usable for such purposes. Persons with disabilities parking needs shall be met in accordance with standards contained in O.C.G.A. §§ 30-3-1—30-3-4.1 and 40-6-221—40-6-226. 
                  905.2.  General requirements. Each use of land and each building or structure hereafter constructed or established, and each addition to a structure, shall provide off-street parking and loading according to the standards set forth herein. When an addition is made to a building on land containing less than the required parking or loading requirements, a conforming amount of parking or loading shall be supplied based upon the size of the addition. 
                  No addition to an existing building shall be constructed which reduces the number of spaces, area or usability of existing parking or loading space unless such building and its addition conform with the regulations for parking and loading contained herein. 
                  Parking spaces for persons with disabilities shall be required. Existing uses providing off-street parking undergoing renovation and new uses providing off-street parking shall incorporate spaces for persons with disabilities into the design of parking facilities. 
                  905.3.  Minimum off-street parking and loading requirements. 
                  (A)  The minimum number of off-street parking spaces and loading stalls required by type of permitted use is depicted in table IX-1. For any use not listed on table IX-1, the zoning administrator shall determine the proper requirement by classifying the proposed use among the uses specified in table IX-1, so as to ensure equal treatment. In making any such determination, the zoning administrator shall follow the principles set forth in the statement of purpose at the beginning of this section. 
                  (B)  When multiple uses occupy a building, the parking and loading requirement shall be met by determining the percentage of the total building area devoted to each type of use and then applying the appropriate requirements by use. 
                  (C)  Parking spaces for persons with disabilities shall be, provided in accordance with table IX-2. 
                  905.4.  Exception to parking and loading requirements. The zoning administrator may grant a special exception to the requirements specified in subsection 905.3(A) (table IX-1) up to ten spaces per project and no more than ten percent of the minimum requirement. However, this exception shall not reduce requirements specified under subsection 905.3(C) (table IX-2). The city council may waive or vary parking requirements for persons with disabilities specified herein upon making a determination that a unique hardship exists. 
                  905.5.  Design standards. 
                  (A)  The following design standards shall be used to achieve compliance with parking provisions of this appendix. These requirements are summarized in table IX-3. 
                  (1)  Each full-size automobile parking space shall not be less than nine feet wide and 20 feet deep. Parallel spaces for persons with disabilities adjacent to a walk shall be a minimum of 12 feet, six inches in width by 24 feet in length. If a walk is at an elevation different from that of the parking space, a 1:6-sloped ramp shall be, provided to the walk. For 90-degree or angled spaces the minimum width of a persons with disabilities stall shall be nine feet. An aisle, having a width of not less than three feet, six inches, shall be, provided between each stall. 
                  (2)  Spaces for persons with disabilities shall be marked on the pavement and by appropriate signage, both markings to use the universally accepted persons with disabilities symbol. Spaces for persons with disabilities shall be located in closest proximity to major building entrances, but in no event shall such spaces be more than 100 feet from an entrance. 
                  (3)  Adequate interior driveways shall connect each parking space with a public right-of-way. Where 90-degree parking is utilized, all interior driveways shall be a minimum of 24 feet in width.

In the instance where parallel parking is utilized or there is no parking, interior driveways shall be a minimum of 12 feet in width for one-way traffic and 24 feet in width for two-way traffic. 
                  (4)  All multiple-family, commercial and industrial uses shall provide a paved surface. The use of approved "porous pavement" is encouraged, provided such paving is approved for use by the city engineer. If these facilities are to be used at night, proper illumination shall be, provided for the safety of pedestrians, vehicles and for security purposes. Lighting shall be designed so as not to reflect onto or cause glare in any adjacent residential district. Driveways serving single-family and duplex residences shall be paved for the entire width of the public right-of-way.

If loading stalls are to be used at night, they shall be properly illuminated for the safety of pedestrians, vehicles and for security. Lighting shall be designed to preclude light spill onto adjacent properties. 
                  (4)  Loading stalls are not to hinder movement of pedestrians or vehicles over a street, sidewalk or alley, or to and from an off-street parking area. 
                  (5)  All off-street loading stalls shall be located so as not to be visible from the public right-of-way on which the building is located. Further, a fence and/or dense vegetation (as specified by the zoning administrator) shall be installed to screen the loading stalls from view of residents of adjoining residential development. Any person adversely affected by this requirement may appeal to and be granted relief by the city council. 
                  Sec. 906. - Flag lots. 
                  Before a building permit shall be issued for any residential structure to be located more than 200 feet from the pavement of the road, and which is to sit upon a lot that has 75 feet or less of frontage along said road, the applicant thereof shall submit an affidavit of acknowledgment on a form to be provided by the zoning administrator. 
                  Said affidavit shall acknowledge that the applicant, its heirs and assigns shall retain sole responsibility to see that a suitable right-of-way is maintained from the street to the structure so as to enable emergency vehicles to safely reach such structure. 
                  This affidavit shall be filed in the real estate records of the superior court under the name of the then-current owner of such lot. 
                  Sec. 907. - Spacing between structures. 
                  No residential structure shall be constructed less than ten feet in distance from another residential structure unless and until the building inspector determines that the structures involved are to be constructed in a manner and with materials which will ensure that the structures will be in compliance with the fire rating standards for the proposed spacing. Said structures shall be so constructed in accordance with the plans and conditions approved by the building inspector. In no event shall the building inspector approve construction of, nor shall any person construct, a building which does not meet the spacing requirements of this appendix unless and until a variance has been approved to allow such spacing pursuant to article XIII of this appendix. 
                  Sec. 908. - Reactivated development. 
                  In any existing subdivision whereby 50 percent or more of the approved lots are built out and have had no permitted development or building activity for a period of more than 24 months following the approval of the final plat, construction of dwelling structures on the remaining lots must be at least of minimal comparable architectural and component quality to those existing structures. Comparability standards may include but are not limited to size of the structure, roof material and design, exterior siding materials, foundation, garage/carport capacities, and general aesthetic appearance.

                  Final as-built site plans shall be required for all developments requiring a predevelopment site plan and shall be at the same scale as the predevelopment site plan for the same project. The as-built site plan shall contain the same information as the predevelopment site plan requirements for the same project. The zoning administrator may, if he deems it appropriate, accept a certification by the owner and surveyor/engineer that the project was built in conformity with the approved predevelopment site plan except for specific changes indicated on the plan.

                  1201.1  General procedures. 
                  (A)  No development shall be permitted or undertaken without the zoning administrator having first certified the predevelopment site plan and evidencing that the proposed development as depicted on said plan is to be in compliance with this appendix; however: 
                  (1)  Such certification shall not be required for single-family dwellings, permitted accessory structures or agricultural related accessory structures when located on a lot shown on a final plat of a residential subdivision which was approved prior to adoption of this appendix;

                  (A)  When the zoning administrator's approval is required on plans as stated in subsection 1201.1 of this section, the procedures to be followed shall be specified in the procedures established pursuant to subsection 1201.1(B) of this section. 
                  (B)  The zoning administrator, when reviewing predevelopment site plans, may take any action outlined below:

                  (C)  If the city engineer determines that changes substantially affecting the parking, buffer or building locations are necessary, the zoning administrator must approve the changes before the grading permit is issued.

                  (A)  A building permit issued by the building inspector is required in advance of the initiation of construction, erection, moving or alteration of any building or structure where the estimated cost of such construction, erection, moving or alteration is estimated to be in excess of $100.00. 
                  (B)  The developer or builder shall stake out, or cause to be staked out, with markers at least 24 inches in height, the required setback distances (front, rear and side yards), building footprint and property lines. This staking shall be in place at the time the building inspector conducts the foundation/footings inspections. 
                  (C)  Upon completion of the build foundation up to the first floor of the building, the builder or developer shall obtain a survey by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer specifying the elevation of the building's first floor, elevations of any floodplain on the lot on which the building is being constructed, and elevations of the ground in all directions 20 feet from the building. This survey shall be required before any further inspections are made or work is undertaken but only if any of the following conditions are met: 
                  (1)  The final plat of the subdivision in which the lot is located shows a floodplain line on any portion of the subject lot. 
                  (2)  The zoning administrator indicates the apparent presence of a 100-year floodplain on the property unless a survey by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer states to the contrary. 
                  (3)  A review of the flood boundary and floodway maps for the city prepared for the Federal Insurance Administration indicates a possibility of the presence of a 100-year floodplain on the subject property unless a registered land surveyor or professional engineer certifies to the contrary. 
                  1201.4.  Final certification of zoning compliance. Any development requiring the zoning administrator's approval of predevelopment plans under subsection 1201.2 of this section is also subject to the requirements of this subsection. Accordingly, prior to obtaining a certificate of occupancy for any such development, the builder/developer shall obtain a final certification of zoning compliance from the zoning administrator. To obtain such final certification, the builder/developer must submit an as-built site plan to the zoning administrator in accordance with such policies and procedures which the zoning administrator is to establish. In lieu of a complete as-built site plan, the builder/developer may submit an as-built site plan for only those items developed different from the approved predevelopment site plan. 
                  1201.5.  Certificate of occupancy. Upon the completion of construction activity requiring a building permit, the developer or builder shall obtain a certificate of occupancy.

                  1202.2.  Procedures. The zoning administrator is to establish policies and procedures for review and approval/disapproval of requests for certification of use compliance. These policies and procedures are to be followed for use compliance certifications. 
                  Sec. 1203. - Expiration of certifications. 
                  If no application is made to obtain permits to develop or construct buildings or property or begin exercising a use of a building or land for which the zoning administrator issued a certification of approval within 180 days of issuance of that certification, then the certification is null and void. This section shall apply to all certifications issued pursuant to subsections 1201.2, 1201.4 and section 1202 of this appendix. If a permit issued upon the basis of a certification issued pursuant to subsections 1201.2, 1201.4 and section 1202 of this appendix is canceled or voided, then the certification made by the zoning administrator shall also be voided. 
                  Sec. 1204. - Violations. 
                  If it is found that any of the provisions of this appendix are being violated, the person responsible for such violations shall be notified in writing, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it.

The zoning administrator shall order discontinuance of illegal use of lands, buildings or structures, or of illegal additions, alterations or structural changes; discontinuance of any illegal additions, alterations or structural changes; discontinuance of any illegal work being done; or shall take any other action authorized by this appendix to ensure compliance with or to prevent violation of its provisions. When ordering corrective action, the zoning administrator may order removal of structures or portions thereof installed or constructed illegally or otherwise in violation of this appendix. 
                  Sec. 1205. - Zoning administration actions. 
                  The zoning administrator's actions taken pursuant to this appendix shall be considered as having been on behalf of the mayor and council. 
                  Sec. 1206. - Construction and use to be as stated in application, plans and permits. 
                  Any certifications or permits issued on the basis of plans and applications approved by the zoning administrator authorize only the use, arrangement and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other use, arrangement or construction. Use, arrangement or construction at variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this appendix. 
                  Sec. 1207. - Interpretations. 
                  In interpreting and applying the provisions of this appendix, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of health, safety and convenience of the general welfare. The lot or yard area required by these regulations for a particular building yard shall not be diminished and shall not be included as part of the lot or yard areas of any other building.

                  Sec. 1210. - Fees. 
                  The zoning administrator shall assess, on behalf of the city council, and collect fees for actions pursuant to this appendix based on the fee schedule adopted by the city council by separate action.

                  i.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular property in question because of its size, shape or topography; 
                  ii.  The application of this chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  iii.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; 
                  iv.  Such conditions are not the result of any actions of the property owner; 
                  v.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public nor impair the purposes or intent of this chapter; 
                  vi.  The variance is granted for a use of land or building or structure that is not prohibited by this chapter; 
                  vii.  A variance to a numerically qualified ordinance limit where the request does not exceed 25 percent of that limit; 
                  viii.  A variance for a conforming change to a nonconforming structure where such change does not increase the impact of the existing nonconformance aspects.

                  (b)  Limitations. An administrative variance may not be granted if any prior variances (granted or denied) were considered for the property involved within the last year. 
                  (c)  Expiration of approved variances. If applicable portions of this chapter have been amended or modified, or more than one year has elapsed, prior to the commencement of construction or other activity authorized by an approved variance request, a reapplication and hearing before the city manager shall be required.

                  (a)  In cases of administrative variances, appeals to the mayor and council may be made by any person aggrieved or by any official of the city affected by any decision of the city manager. Such appeal shall be taken within 15 days by filing with the council a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. A copy of the appeal shall be served upon the city clerk. The city manager shall promptly transmit to the city council all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from. Should any party be aggrieved by a stay, said person may seek a restraining order from the superior court of the county. 
                  (b)  Before the city council may act upon an appeal by any proper party to review any grant or denial of a variance from the terms of this appendix by the city manager: 
                  1.  A public hearing shall be held thereon. A notice of the time and place of the public hearing shall be published at least 15 days prior to the hearing in the official organ of the county in which the sheriff's advertisements are published.

                  Any person severally or jointly aggrieved by any decision by the city council may take an appeal to the superior court of the county.

                  Sec. 1401. - Conditional uses, permits. 
                  Several of the zoning districts established herein permit certain uses which are allowable therein, provided they meet specified conditions, as set forth therein and elsewhere. No such use shall be permitted until a conditional use permit has been issued authorizing such use. The procedures for granting such permits shall be the same as for amendments to this zoning ordinance or the zoning map. 
                  Sec. 1402. - Preview of applications for conditional use. 
                  Those conditions specified in the zoning district regulations shall be considered to be the minimum standards which must be met before the conditional use application may be considered by the city council.

                  Sec. 1403. - Issuance of permit. 
                  If the city council, after applying the evidence to the standards of review, has been convinced that the allowance of the conditional use would promote the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the city, a conditional use permit may be allowed, subject to those provisions, if any, that may be imposed pursuant to section 1508. 
                  Sec. 1404. - Terms of conditional use permits. 
                  Due to the sensitive nature of the uses regulated by the conditional use permit procedures, all conditional use permits shall expire by operation of law one year from issuance if: 
                  (1)  In instances where no structure is to be erected, the site has not been utilized for the conditional use within one year; or 
                  (2)  In those instances in which a building or structure is to be erected, an application for building permit has not been submitted within one year.

Within ten days of receipt of such a site plan, the zoning administrator shall determine its compliance with article XI of this appendix and shall either accept it as being "sufficient" or reject it as being "insufficient." If it is so rejected, the revised application may be resubmitted for the following application period. The city will refund 50 percent of the application fee for a rezoning if the administrator rejects said application due to an insufficient site plan. 
                  Sec. 1502. - Reserved. 
                  Sec. 1503. - Preliminary review of application for amendment. 
                  All proposed amendments to the official zoning map or text, except those proposed by the city council, shall be transmitted by the city clerk to the zoning administrator for study and recommendation by the zoning administrator. After completing his study of the proposed amendment, the zoning administrator shall submit his report to the city council for consideration and action. 
                  Notwithstanding any requirement herein to the contrary, all proposed amendments shall be referred by the zoning administrator to the city council within 90 days of receipt of all materials to be considered under this appendix. 
                  Sec. 1504. - Notification and public hearing. 
                  Before enacting an amendment to this appendix, whether the proposed amendment is a text or map amendment, the city council shall hold a public hearing thereon for the purpose of receiving and considering public comment on the merits of the proposed amendment. Said hearings shall be held only after substantial compliance with all required public notification of the hearing as set forth herein. 
                  The city shall cause a legal notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Lovejoy, Georgia, at least 15 but not more than 45 days prior to the required public hearing by the city council, stating, where applicable, the time and place of said hearing, the location of the property, and the present and proposed zoning classifications. 
                  Additionally, whenever a proposed amendment to this appendix involves changes in the zoning classification of property from one zone to another (map amendment), the zoning administrator shall cause to have posted in a conspicuous place on the area proposed to be rezoned one or more signs, each of which shall not be less than three square feet in area and each of which shall contain the time, dates and location of the public hearings scheduled for the application and such other information as the zoning administrator deems appropriate. 
                  If the property proposed for rezoning does not have frontage on a public street, then an additional sign may be posted on the right-of-way of the nearest public street which provides access to the site. No public hearing may be held by the city council until the signs have been posted for at least 15 days. 
                  Sec. 1505. - Hearings on zoning matters; procedures. 
                  (A)  The city council will hold a public hearing on all petitions referred to the council at its regularly scheduled meeting, or at any special called meeting which is properly noticed and advertised in accordance with state law. All public hearings set forth in this section shall be held at city hall for the City of Lovejoy. 
                  (B)  The governing, calling and conducting of hearings shall be accomplished in accordance with the following policies and procedures: 
                  (1)  If any person desires a stenographic record of the proceedings, such person shall make arrangement for such by informing the clerk of the city council, who shall arrange for a stenographer to record the proceedings. The costs of such shall be borne by the person or persons requesting stenographic recording. No stenographer not arranged for in accordance with this section shall be allowed to set up in the hearing room. 
                  (2)  The mayor shall indicate that a public hearing has been called for the consideration of zoning decisions. Thereupon, the city council shall consider each application on an individual basis. 
                  (3)  When an application comes up for review, the city council shall ask for a show of hands for those persons who appear in support of/opposition to the petition. If it appears that the number of persons wishing to appear in support of/opposition to the petition is in excess of that which may reasonably be heard, the city council may request that a spokesman for the group be chosen so that the entire presentation of the positions of those in support of or in opposition to the petition shall not exceed 30 minutes. 
                  (4)  After the comments and concerns of the public have been heard, the city council may thereupon request a report from the officer or agents of the city. 
                  (5)  The applicant for the zoning amendment shall be allowed a short opportunity for rebuttal and final comment. 
                  (6)  After the above procedures have been completed, the mayor will indicate that the public hearing is formally closed. 
                  (7)  After the public hearing is closed, the city council may either vote upon the proposed change or may delay their vote to a subsequent meeting, provided that notice of the time, date and location when such zoning decision is to be made shall be announced at the meeting during which the public hearing is held. 
                  Sec. 1506. - Standards of review. 
                  (A)  In ruling on any application for zoning map amendment, the city council shall act in the best interest of the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the city. In doing so they will consider one or more of the following factors as they may be relevant to the application: 
                  (1)  The existing land use pattern; 
                  (2)  The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts; 
                  (3)  The population density pattern and possible increase or overtaxing of the load on public facilities, including, but not limited to, schools, utilities and streets; 
                  (4)  The cost of the city and other governmental entities in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets and other public safety measures; 
                  (5)  The possible impact on the environment, including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality and water quantity; 
                  (6)  Whether the proposed zoning map amendment will be a deterrent to the value or improvement of development of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations; 
                  (7)  Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing regulations; 
                  (8)  The aesthetic effect of existing and future use of the property as it relates to the surrounding area; 
                  (9)  The extent to which the proposed zoning map amendment is consistent with the land use plan; 
                  (10)  The possible effects of the proposed zoning map amendment on the character of a zoning district, a particular piece of property, neighborhood, a particular area or the community; 
                  (11)  The relation that the proposed zoning map amendment bears to the purpose of the overall zoning scheme, with due consideration given to whether or not the proposed change will help carry out the purposes of these zoning regulations; 
                  (12)  Applications for a zoning map amendment which do not contain specific site plans carry a rebuttal presumption that such rezoning shall adversely affect the zoning scheme; 
                  (13)  The consideration of the preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall be considered to carry great weight; 
                  (14)  In those instances in which property fronts on a major thoroughfare and also adjoins an established residential neighborhood, the factor of preservation of the residential area shall be considered to carry great weight. 
                  After hearing evidence at the zoning hearing, the city council shall apply the evidence to the standards of review in making their decision. It will not be required that the city council consider every criteria contained in the standards of review. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the public health, safety, morality or general welfare of the city. 
                  If the city council determines from the evidence presented that the applicant has shown that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the city under the standards of review, then the application shall be granted, subject to those reasonable provisions as may be imposed by the council pursuant to section 1507. Otherwise such application shall be denied. 
                  (B)  In ruling on any petition in which the petitioner has brought a challenge of the existing zoning classification, the council may impose upon said property any appropriate zoning classification, including provisions allowed by section 1507, which might be consistent with the considerations contained in subsection (A) of this section. 
                  Sec. 1507. - Provisional zoning. 
                  In deciding upon any application for zoning map amendment, the city council may, on their own motion or upon the suggestion of the applicant, grant the application subject to certain provisions necessary to promote and protect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the city. Such provisions shall be imposed for the benefit of the community to lessen any negative effects that the zoning map amendment may cause. 
                  The city council may grant any zoning map amendment and include provisions as follows: 
                  (1)  Such provisions as are deemed necessary to protect neighbors and to lessen any negative effects of the zoning change; 
                  (2)  That the rezoning is provisional upon the condition that the applicant or any successor in title may construct only those uses and only in such a manner as is depicted upon any site plan submitted and approved with the application. 
                  Prior to a final vote being taken upon any application for a zoning map amendment in which provisions shall be imposed, such provisions will be announced at the hearing and the applicant shall be afforded an opportunity to present its position on such provisional requirements. If the applicant finds such proposed provisional requirements to be unacceptable, it may, at that time, withdraw its application for zoning map amendment; such withdrawal shall not enable such applicant to refile for a zoning map amendment contrary to city or state law. 
                  If the city council adopts a zoning map amendment which contains provisional requirements, such requirements shall become a part of this appendix and the official zoning map. Such property shall thereafter carry the suffix "-P" to indicate that such property has been provisionally zoned (e.g., AG-P, RG-75-P etc.). Such provisions shall be binding upon all owners of the property until removed or modified by the city council. The zoning administrator shall so indicate in the records of the zoning actions the existence of the provisional requirements. If the zoning administrator deems it appropriate and feasible, the suffix "-P" shall be affixed to the zoning map for the appropriate property. 
                  A provisional requirement may be imposed upon either permitted and/or conditional uses in any zoning district. In ruling on such provisional requirements the city council shall utilize the applicable standards of review contained in section 1506 of this appendix. 
                  In those instances where a rezoning is granted which is provisional upon the submitted site plan, such property shall revert to its former zoning classification by operation of law if a building permit for such development has not been applied for within one year, provided that the city council, at a zoning hearing, may extend this period for good cause shown by the property owner. The zoning administrator may grant "minor" changes to such site plans subject to the provisions of section 818.8(D). 
                  It shall be the duty of the zoning administrator to periodically review such provisional rezoning and to report to the city council those rezoning actions which have reverted by operation of law. 
                  Sec. 1508. - Amendment to provisions. 
                  Procedures for removing any provisional requirements shall be the same as any other zoning amendment. 
                  Sec. 1509. - PUD district approval. 
                  Within 14 days of a rezoning action by the city council to establish a PUD zoning district, the zoning administrator shall issue a development order specifying the condition under which the PUD must be developed. The conditions shall apply to any development on the subject property regardless of ownership. 
                  Sec. 1510. - Reversion. 
                  Approval of all RS-65, RM, RMTH, RMH, NB, CB, GB, LI, HI and conditional structure/use zoning amendments shall be in effect for 12 months. However, if a building permit, grading permit or business license has not been issued and construction (if any is necessary) begun within this 12-month period after such amendment is approved, the zoning approval may be withdrawn and the city council may reinstate the prior zoning district and regulations or apply any intervening zoning district and applicable regulations to the property. Alternatively, the city council may extend the zoning an additional 12 months and any number of subsequent 12-month periods by only on such period at a time. Reversion of PUD zoning shall be as set forth in the development order for the particular PUD. Procedures for reversion shall be the same as a regular zoning amendment.

                  Should any section or provision of this appendix be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of this appendix as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
                  Sec. 1605. - Preexisting zone classifications converted. 
                  In the zoning resolution preexisting this appendix various properties were zoned as R-AA, R-1A, R-A, R-1B, R-1C, R-2, R-2D, R-3, R-4, R-4C, R-4D, R-4TH, MHP, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, M-1 and M-2.

                  All conditions previously imposed on the various properties as part of a prior zoning action of the City of Lovejoy city council are hereby carried forward. Similarly, all conditional uses previously approved are hereby carried forward. 
                  Sec. 1606. - Preexisting zone classification not carried forward. 
                  (a)  In the zoning resolution preexisting this appendix, certain property was zoned as L-1 limited use. This classification is not carried forward hereunder. 
                  (b)  All property developments located on previously-zoned L-1 property are hereby declared to be nonconforming uses, not to be subject to amortization. 
                  ARTICLE XVII. - TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS AND ANTENNAS 

                  Sec. 1700. - Short title. 
                  This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Telecommunication Towers and Antennas Ordinance." 
                  Sec. 1701. - Purpose; goals. 
                  This article is enacted for the purpose of safeguarding the public health, safety, and welfare by establishing general guidelines for the location and placement of antennas and towers. The goals of this article are to: 
                  (i)  Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; 
                  (ii)  Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower locations; 
                  (iii)  Encourage users of antennas and towers to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the citizens of the city is minimal; 
                  (iv)  Encourage users of antennas and towers to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the antennas and towers; and 
                  (v)  Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunication services to render such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently. 
                  Sec. 1702. - Definitions. 
                  The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article, unless otherwise specifically stated:

                  FCC means the Federal Communications Commission. 
                  Height means, when referring to a tower or other structure, the distance measured from ground level to the highest point on the tower or other structure, even if the highest point is an antenna. 
                  Microcell means a telecommunication facility composed of no more than four antennas and no more than two equipment boxes. Microcell antennas may be either of a panel design having dimensions of approximately one foot in width and five feet in length, or of an omni (whip) design having dimensions of approximately four inches in diameter and six feet in length. Dimensions of such antennas may vary from operator to operator and as industry standards and designs are modified or revised. 
                  Tower means any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term "tower" shall include, but not be limited to, the following: Radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common carrier towers, and cellular telephone towers. 
                  Sec. 1703. - Applicability. 
                  a.  District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this article shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of, the height limitations specified for each zoning district. The height limitations applicable to such structures, as specified in each zoning district, shall not apply to antennas and towers. 
                  b.  City property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the city shall be exempt from the requirements of this article, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the council. 
                  c.  Exceptions for amateur radio and receive-only antennas. This article shall not govern towers or antennas not exceeding 35 feet in height owned and operated by federally licensed amateur radio station operators. Additionally, this article shall not govern satellite dishes or other receive-only antennas used exclusively for television reception purposes. 
                  d.  Pre-existing antennas and towers. Any tower or antenna for which a building permit has been properly issued, prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, shall not be required to meet the requirements of this article, other than the requirements of sections 1704(d) and 1704(e).

                  (2)  The maximum height for any temporary antenna or tower shall be 70 feet; 
                  (3)  The maximum number of temporary antenna or tower permits to be issued for a single location shall be one per year; and 
                  (4)  Provisions that shall govern the application and consideration for issuing a temporary antenna or tower permit shall be the same as those considerations set forth in section 1705. Provided, however, the council may vary any of the provisions contained therein if the council concludes that the goals of this article are better served thereby. 
                  Sec. 1704. - General guidelines and requirements. 
                  a.  Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either a principal or accessory use. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same parcel of land shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such parcel. For the purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district regulations, including, but not limited to, setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire parcel shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased property within such parcel. Antennas that are installed and towers that are constructed in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
                  b.  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for a building permit to install or construct antenna and/or tower shall provide to the department an inventory of its existing antennas and towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the city or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each antenna and tower. The department may share such information with other applicants applying for conditional use permits under this article, or other organizations seeking to locate antennas and/or towers within the jurisdiction of the city. 
                  c.  Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this subsection shall control the installation of all antennas and the location of all towers governed by this article. Provided, however, that the council may waive or vary the terms of these requirements if it determines that the goals of this article are better served thereby. 
                  (1)  Towers shall be constructed and maintained with either a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness; 
                  (2)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment; 
                  (3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment shall be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible; and 
                  (4)  Antennas and towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable governmental authority. If lighting is required, the department may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
                  d.  Federal requirements. All antennas and towers shall meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate antennas and towers. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owners of the antennas and towers governed by this article shall bring such antennas and towers into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date such standards and regulations. Provided, however, if a more stringent compliance schedule mandated by the controlling federal agency, owners of the antennas and towers shall be required to comply with the more stringent compliance schedule. Failure to bring antennas and towers into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the antennas or towers by the department at the owners' expense. Any such removal caused by the department shall be in the manner, provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17. 
                  e.  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of all antennas and towers, all owners of pre-existing antennas and towers, and owners of antennas and towers governed by this article, shall ensure that they are maintained in compliance with standards contained in the applicable city building codes and the applicable standards for antennas and towers that are published by the electronic industries association as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the department concludes that any antenna and/or tower fails to comply with such codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice being, provided to the owner of the antenna or tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such antenna or tower into compliance with such codes and standards. If the owner fails to bring such antenna or tower into compliance within said 30 days, the department may cause the removal of such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the department shall be in the manner, provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17. 
                  Sec. 1705. - Conditional use permits required. 
                  a.  General. The installation of all antennas and the location of all towers within the city shall require a conditional use permit for every zoning district. The following provisions shall govern the application and consideration for granting conditional use permits: 
                  (1)  Conditional use permits shall be applied for and considered in accordance with article XIV of this appendix; 
                  (2)  In considering a conditional use permit, the council may impose conditions to the extent the council concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect the proposed antenna or tower may have on adjoining properties; and 
                  (3)  Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer. 
                  b.  Information required. Each applicant requesting a conditional use permit under this article shall submit a scaled site plan, elevation view, and other supporting drawings, calculations, and documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements. Additionally, information may be required by the council concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and any other information deemed by the council to be necessary to assess compliance with this article. 
                  c.  Factors considered in granting conditional use permits. The council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit. Provided, however, the council may vary any of such factors if the council concludes that the goals of this article are better served thereby. 
                  (1)  Height of the proposed antenna or tower; 
                  (2)  Proximity of the antenna or tower to other structures and zoning district boundaries; 
                  (3)  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (4)  Surrounding topography, 
                  (5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
                  (6)  Design of the antenna or tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
                  (7)  Availability of suitable existing antennas or towers and other structures; 
                  (8)  Proximity of the antenna or tower to other antennas or towers; and 
                  (9)  Such other and additional standards of review as are set forth in section 1506. 
                  d.  Availability of suitable existing antennas, towers, or other structures. No new antennas or towers shall be permitted, unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the council that no existing antenna, tower, or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna or tower. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing antenna, tower, or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna, tower, or structure may consist of any of the following: 
                  (1)  No existing antennas, towers, or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  (2)  Existing antennas, towers, or structures are not designed to meet applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  (3)  Existing antennas, towers, or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment; 
                  (4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna; 
                  (5)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure, or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing, are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed for the purposes of this paragraph to be unreasonable; 
                  (6)  Property owners or owners of existing towers or structures are unwilling to reasonably accommodate the applicant's needs; and 
                  (7)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  e.  Setback and separation. The following setback and separation requirements shall apply to all antennas and towers. Provided, however, the council may, in its sole discretion, grant a variance to reduce the standard setback and separation requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby. 
                  (1)  Antennas and towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the respective antenna or tower from the boundary line of any residential zoning district (effectively creating a buffer equal to the height of the antenna or tower); and 
                  (2)  Antennas, towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
                  f.  Security fencing. Antennas and towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. Provided, however, that the council may vary such requirements, as it deems appropriate. 
                  g.  Buffers and landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the buffers and landscaping surrounding antennas and towers. Provided, however, that the council may vary such requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby. 
                  (1)  Antenna and tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the antenna or tower compound from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least 25 feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound; 
                  (2)  Buffer reductions may be allowed when existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on site are preserved to the stances where such antennas or towers are located on large wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer; and 
                  (3)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. 
                  h.  Conditional use permits not required. The following uses are specifically permitted without a conditional use permit: 
                  (1)  Installing an antenna (excluding a microcell) on an existing alterative tower structure, or structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or similar freestanding non-residential structure), that is 50 feet in height or greater, so long as the additional antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the existing structure; 
                  (2)  Installing a microcell on an existing alterative tower structure, or non-residential structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, fight pole, water tower, or similar freestanding structure), so long as the microcell adds no more than six feet to the height of the existing structure; and 
                  (3)  Installing an antenna on any existing tower of any height, so long as the addition of the antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the existing tower. Such specific permitted use shall also include the placement of any additional building or other supporting equipment used in connection with the antenna. Provided, however, the additional building shall be consistent in type of exterior material and quality of design and construction with any other building constructed upon the premises. The criteria relative to consistency with an existing building and to which existing building, if more than one building previously exists, shall be within the sole discretion of the department. 
                  Removal of abandoned antennas, towers, or structures. Any antenna, tower, or structure that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and such antenna, tower, or structure shall be removed within 90 days of receipt of notice from the department notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna, tower, or structure is not removed within 90 days, the department may, in the manner, provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17, remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense.
