PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of Bartow County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the county commissioner. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President of Municipal Code Corporation, and Kelly Cribbs, supplement editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to county staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

                  ORDINANCE READOPTING THE CODE OF BARTOW COUNTY, GEORGIA 
                  AN ORDINANCE OF THE COUNTY COMMISSIONER OF BARTOW COUNTY SITTING FOR COUNTY PURPOSES FOR THE PURPOSE OF READOPTING THE CODE OF BARTOW COUNTY, GEORGIA; ADOPTING CHAPTER 1, GENERAL PROVISIONS; ADOPTING CHAPTER 2, ADMINISTRATION; ADOPTING CHAPTER 22, COURTS; MAKING TYPOGRAPHICAL CORRECTIONS; REPEALING UNADOPTED PROVISIONS; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES AT THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE COMMISSIONER OF BARTOW COUNTY HELD ON DECEMBER 3, 2008 
                  WHEREAS, O.C.G.A. § 36-80-19 requires all local governing authorities to provide for the general codification of all the ordinances and resolutions of that unit of local government having the force and effect of law; and 
                  WHEREAS, in compliance with O.C.G.A. § 36-80-19, Bartow County adopted the Code of Bartow County, as complied by the Municipal Code Corporation on December 3, 2003; and 
                  WHEREAS, the Code of Bartow County adopted in 2003 contained various errors, including ordinances not previously adopted by Bartow County, which were unknowingly inserted by Municipal Code Corporation in the Code of Ordinance, but were not intended to be part of the County's Code; and the ordinances and resolutions of Bartow County further having been substantially amended and revised in the intervening time; and 
                  WHEREAS, the Code of Bartow County having been corrected to remove any ordinance not adopted by Bartow County, and by having inserted such amendments and revisions that have been made between 2003 and 2007, and the aforesaid changes having been submitted to Municipal Code Corporation for inclusion in the Code; 
                  NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED AND IT HEREBY IS ORDAINED, by virtue of the authority vested in the Commissioner by law, and pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-80-19, that the Code of Bartow County, Georgia, consisting of Chapters 1 to 74 and Appendices A and B, as published by Municipal Code Corporation, and as incorporated herein by reference, is adopted as the codification of Bartow County's existing ordinances. Other than the provisions of Chapter 1 "General Provisions"; Chapter 2 "Administration"; Chapter 22, "Courts"; and any typographical corrections, which are new provisions and which are intended to be adopted as official ordinances of Bartow County by this ordinance, any additions contained in the Code of Bartow County, Georgia adopted hereby that do not have an antecedent ordinance duly adopted by Bartow County, Georgia are not intended to be a part of the County's Code and shall be of no force or effect. The intention of the Commissioner of Bartow County is that, other than the foregoing specifically mentioned provisions, only those ordinances duly and lawfully adopted and amended throughout the years by the governing authority shall be included in the Code. 
                  IT IS FURTHER ORDAINED that the prior codification of the Code of Bartow County is repealed and replaced with this codification. This action does not repeal any ordinances contained in the prior codification except any ordinances or provisions that had no antecedent Bartow County ordinance and thus were never lawfully adopted by Bartow County. Said provisions have been deleted from the Code of Bartow County as adopted herein. Furthermore, the newly revised Code of Bartow County contains updated versions of existing ordinances, which were amended and revised by prior action of the Commissioner. 
                  IT IS FURTHER ORDAINED that the adoption of this Code of Ordinances is not intended to readopt the existing Bartow County ordinances contained herein, but rather to readopt the corrected and updated republication and codification of existing ordinances for convenience of the public and to comply with the laws of Georgia requiring codification. This action specifically is not intended to readopt the Bartow County Zoning Ordinance or other ordinances requiring special notice and adoption procedures. 
                  SO ADOPTED this 3rd day of December, 2008. 

                   
                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omitted." 
                  Adding to this table with each supplement enables users of this Code of Ordinances to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                  The catchlines of sections in this Code printed in boldface type, italics, or otherwise are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section, and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted.

                  The following grammatical rules shall apply in the ordinances and resolutions of the county unless it is apparent from the context that a different construction is intended:

                  When an act is required by resolution or ordinance, the act being such that it may be done as well by an agent as by the principal, such requirement shall be construed to include all such acts performed by a designated agent.

                  Sec. 1-15. - Provisions considered continuations of existing resolutions. 
                  The provisions appearing in this Code, so far as they are the same as resolutions or ordinances adopted prior to this Code and included in such Code, shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments. 
                  Sec. 1-16. - Amendments to Code. 
                  (a)  All resolutions or ordinances passed subsequent to this Code which amend, repeal, or in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion in this Code. In the case of repealed chapters, sections, and subsections, or any part thereof, by subsequent resolutions or ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby.

A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of resolutions or ordinances passed by the county commissioner during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest resolution or ordinance included in the supplement. 
                  (b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
                  (c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in resolutions and parts of resolutions included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)  Organize the resolution or ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings, and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings, and titles. 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
                  (4)  Change the words "this resolution" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the resolution or ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of resolution or ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of resolution material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-18. - Altering Code. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person in the county to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the county to be misrepresented thereby, unless so authorized by resolution or ordinance or other official act of the county commissioner.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 4-31. - Rationale and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the county, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the county. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
                  (b)  Findings and rationale. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the commissioner, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions incorporated in the cases of City of Littleton v.

Jackson , 242 Ga. 214 (1978); and based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas - 1986; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Houston, Texas - 1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979, 1995-98; Chattanooga, Tennessee - 1999-2003; Minneapolis, Minnesota - 1980; Los Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Spokane, Washington - 2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota - 1994; Littleton, Colorado - 2004; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma - 1986; Dallas, Texas - 1997; San Diego, California - 2003; Greensboro, North Carolina - 2003; Amarillo, Texas - 1977; New York, New York Times Square - 1994; and the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the commissioner finds: 
                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
                  (2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from certain land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and the surrounding area, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
                  (3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the county has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the county's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the county's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the county. The county finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

                  Direct voice command. To qualify as under direct voice command, the person must be 1) outside with the animal, 2) in close proximity to the animal, and 3) the animal must be demonstrably responsive to voice commands. A person inside a structure shall not be considered under this section to have voice command over an animal that is outside. 
                  Close proximity shall mean within a distance where the animal can respond to spoken (not shouted) commands. 
                  (b)  Tethering. Animals may only be tethered under the following circumstances: 
                  (1)  A person restraining an animal with a tether shall attach the tether to a properly fitting collar or harness worn by the animal. A person may not use choke collars, pinch collars, prong collars or similar devices, nor may a person wrap a tether directly around an animal's neck; 
                  (2)  A person may not restrain an animal with a tether in a manner that does not allow the animal to access necessary shelter and water, including shade when the temperature is above 80 degrees Fahrenheit; 
                  (3)  The length of the tether should be no less than five times the length of the animal, measured from the tip of the animal's nose to the base of its tail. In any event, a person may not restrain an animal with a tether less than ten feet in length; 
                  (4)  The animal must be tethered in a safe manner and not in a fashion that subjects the animal to tangling and choking risks; and 
                  (5)  A person restraining an animal with a tether shall ensure that the area in which the animal is confined is free of garbage, fecal matter, or other debris that can cause harm to the animal. 
                  (6)  A dog must not be tethered to a stationary point or object; only tethering to a running cable line or trolley line is permitted if a dog is tethered outside. 
                  (7)  Cables and devices used must be adequately matched to the strength and size of the dog to prevent breaking. The tether should have a swivel clasp on each end. 
                  (c)  Tethering on public property. No person shall tie, stake or fasten any animal within any street, alley, sidewalk or other public place or in such manner that the animal has access to any portion of any street, alley, sidewalk or other public place. 
                  (d)  Dogs in heat. Every female dog in heat shall be confined in a building or other enclosure in such manner that such female dog cannot come into contact with another animal except for planned breeding. 
                  (e)  Animals in vehicles.

                  (c)  Abandonment. It shall be unlawful for the owner or custodian of any animal to abandon such animal on any street, road, highway or public place, or on private property when not in the care of another person. 
                  (d)  Unattended animals. It shall be unlawful for the owner or custodian of any animal to leave such animal in any location unattended for longer than 24 hours. It shall be unlawful to keep or board animals on property that is not residentially occupied or is otherwise commercial property that is the location of an operating business, such that the property is visited daily during the week and at least once on the weekend. 
                  (e)  Accumulation of waste matter. It shall be unlawful for any owner or custodian of any animal to permit the accumulation of waste matter from animals to collect and remain on the property of the owner or custodian, or on the property of others so as to cause or create an unhealthy, unsanitary, dangerous or offensive living condition on the owner's or custodian's property, or to abutting property of others. It shall be unlawful to allow animal waste matter to run off into any river, stream, lake, pond or other watercourse in Bartow County, or to run off onto any other person's property. 
                  (f)  Failure to provide adequate shelter. It shall be unlawful for any owner or custodian of any animal to fail to provide adequate shelter from the elements for that animal, as appropriate to the species. Providing adequate shelter requires providing sufficient food and water, disposing of waste, providing sufficient temperature control (whether heat, ventilation, or cooling) to prevent suffering by the animal, and not maintaining conditions conducive to disease and infection. In respect to dogs, adequate shelter means at least a dog house or shelter meeting the requirements of subsection 14-19(b). For example, tethering a dog outside during summer without shade or water would be a violation of this section, as well as potentially subsections 14-41(a) and (b). 
                  (g)  Unsanitary, dangerous or offensive conditions. It shall be unlawful for any owner or custodian of any animal to permit or cause unsanitary, dangerous or offensive conditions by virtue of the size or number of animals maintained at a single location or due to the inadequacy of the facilities.

Dogs and cats shall wear current, valid rabies tags attached to their collars at all times, except when removal is necessary for cleaning, grooming or other veterinary care. It shall be unlawful for any owner or custodian of a dog or cat to allow the animal to be outdoors without wearing a collar with a current rabies tag showing that the animal has been inoculated for rabies within one year of any such time as the rabies tag may be checked. 
                  (i)  Proper disposal. It shall be unlawful for any owner or custodian of any animal to fail to properly dispose of that animal upon its death. Proper disposal means in a method provided by the Georgia Code at O.C.G.A. § 4-5-5, and includes burning, incineration, burial or rendering of the carcass within 24 hours after death or discovery. Dead animals that are buried must be buried at least three feet below the ground level, have not less than three feet of earth over the carcass, and must not contaminate ground water or surface water. 
                  (j)  Separate violation per animal. Each animal kept in violation of this section shall count as a separate violation.

                  Sec. 14-42. - Sick, injured, or contagious animals. 
                  (a)  Impoundment of sick or injured animals. In any situation deemed appropriate by the animal control officer involving a sick or injured animal whose owner cannot be located and the condition of such animal is such that death or great suffering to the animal is likely, the animal control officer may take custody of such animal and may secure veterinary services for such animal. The owner of such animal shall be responsible for reimbursement of all expenses related to treatment and boarding of the animal. 
                  (b)  Destruction of sick or injured animals. Any sick or injured animal, deemed by a licensed veterinarian to be suffering to such an extent that the humane destruction of the animal is appropriate and the owner of the animal cannot be located, shall be humanely destroyed by the veterinarian in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (c)  Infected or contagious animals. Any animal impounded by the animal control officer that is, in the opinion of a licensed veterinarian, infected with a disease likely to cause death or great suffering to the animal, or which is a contagious disease, or which will likely spread to other animals, shall be isolated and the owner of such animal shall be notified. If the owner cannot be located or the owner fails to take immediate steps to remove the animal from impoundment, the infected animal shall be humanely destroyed in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (d)  Reimbursement. The owner of the animal shall be responsible for reimbursement to the county for all expenses involving the boarding, treatment and destruction of any such animal. 
                  (e)  Notification of bites. It shall be the duty of any person bitten by a wild or domestic animal to immediately notify the Bartow County Health Department and the Bartow County Animal Control Department.

                  (f)  Impoundment and quarantine. The animal control officer shall be authorized to impound and quarantine dogs that have been bitten by wild animals or bitten by dogs or cats that do not have current records of vaccination against rabies. Management of animals exposed to rabies shall be according to the procedures set forth in the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition, which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully herein. The protocols for livestock, dogs, cats and ferrets possibly exposed to rabies, as well as the protocols for animal to animal exposure and human exposure shall be enforced as set forth in the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition. The animal control officer shall be authorized to take any and all steps set forth in said manual up to and including euthanizing and testing of animals. 
                  (g)  Animals impounded for rabies quarantine. Animals impounded for rabies quarantine shall be isolated pursuant to the procedures of the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition. If the animal shows signs of rabies or dies during confinement, it will be sent off for testing. If the animal survives and does not show signs of rabies, it will be returned to the owner upon payment of fees. 
                  (h)  Quarantine/isolation procedures. In certain circumstances, the animal control officer may allow the animal owner to quarantine the animal that has been bitten in lieu of the animal being euthanized and tested. The quarantine period varies depending on the circumstance, as set forth in the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition. In that case, the animal must be placed in a secure enclosure where no other animal or person can be exposed to the virus which can be transmitted into bite wounds, open cuts in skin, and onto mucous membranes. The animal must be kept in a secure enclosure approved by the animal control department and when deemed necessary may require two layers of fencing, separated by at least one foot. Food must be pushed in from a distance, and the animal cannot be approached by any person. Other protocols for quarantine shall be provided by the animal control officer and the Bartow County Health Department. If the animal escapes from the enclosure, it will be impounded and euthanized for testing.

                  Sec. 14-43. - Cruelty to animals. 
                  (a)  Cruelty to animals. It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully or maliciously strike, beat, abuse, intentionally run down with a vehicle, or cause or inflict unnecessary pain, injury, suffering or death to an animal through any act, omission or willful neglect, except that reasonable force may be used to defend his or her own person or property, or the person or property of another, from injury or damage being caused by a dog; or kill any dog causing injury or damage to any livestock, poultry, or pet animal as authorized by Georgia law, O.C.G.A. § 4-8-5. "Willful neglect" means the intentional withholding of food and water required by an animal to prevent starvation or dehydration. 
                  (b)  Poisoning. No person, except a licensed veterinarian for humanitarian purposes, shall intentionally administer poison to any animal or knowingly leave any poisonous substance of any kind or ground glass in any place with the intent to injure any animal.

                  (c)  Investigation. The animal control officer shall investigate complaints pertaining to cruelty to animals. The animal control officer may request the assistance of the sheriff's department or the appropriate law enforcement officers of a participating municipality. 
                  (d)  Necessary pain. In the case of activities where physical pain is necessarily caused, such as medical and scientific research, food processing, customary and normal veterinary and agricultural husbandry practices, pest elimination, and animal training and hunting, failure to employ the most humane method reasonably available shall constitute cruelty to animals and shall be unlawful.

                  Sec. 14-66. - Dog classification. 
                  (a)  Classification levels. "Classified dog" means any dog that has been classified as either a dangerous or vicious dog pursuant to this article. Classifications are as follows: 
                  (1)  Dangerous dog. Any dog that: 
                  a.  Causes a substantial puncture of a person's skin by teeth without causing serious injury (see section 14-13); provided, however, that a nip, scratch, or abrasion shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subparagraph; 
                  b.  Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury (see section 14-13) to such a person or another person although no such injury occurs; provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling, or showing of teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subparagraph; or 
                  c.  While off the owner's property, kills a pet animal; provided, however, that this subparagraph shall not apply where the death of such pet animal is caused by a dog that is working or training as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator control dog. 
                  (2)  Vicious dog. Any dog that inflicts a serious injury on a person or causes serious injury (see section 14-13) to a person resulting from reasonable attempts to escape the dog's attack. 
                  (3)  Euthanasia for causing serious injury on more than one occasion. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-26, a dog that is found, after notice and opportunity for hearing as provided below, to have caused a serious injury to a human on more than one occasion shall be euthanized; provided, however, that no injury occurring before July 1, 2012, shall count for purposes of this subsection. 
                  (4)  Judge authorized to order euthanasia. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-25, the judge of any superior court of competent jurisdiction within this state may order the euthanasia of a dog if the court finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing as provided by this section, that the dog has seriously injured a human or presents a danger to humans not suitable for control under this article and: 
                  a.  The owner or custodian of the dog has been convicted of a violation of any state criminal law and the crime was related to such dog; or 
                  b.  Any local governmental authority has filed with the court a civil action requesting the euthanasia of the dog. 
                  (5)  Previously classified animals. Any dog classified prior to July 1, 2012, as a potentially dangerous dog in this state shall on and after that date be classified as a dangerous dog. Any dog classified prior to July 1, 2012, as a dangerous dog or vicious dog in this state shall on and after that date be classified as a vicious dog under this chapter. The owner of any dog classified prior to July 1, 2012, shall come into compliance with all current provisions of this chapter by January 1, 2013. 
                  (b)  Confiscation. If an animal control officer has reason to believe that a dog has acted in a manner that justifies a classification as a dangerous dog or a vicious dog, the dog may be confiscated, impounded, classified, and notice provided as set forth below. A law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall immediately impound a dog if the officer believes the dog poses a threat to the public safety. 
                  (c)  Exceptions. An animal shall not be classified within the meaning of this section if it inflicts injury upon a person when the animal is being used by a law enforcement officer or military officer to carry out the law enforcement or military officer's official duties. No dog shall be classified as a dangerous or vicious dog if the person injured by such dog was a person who, at the time, was: 1) committing a trespass; 2) was abusing the dog; or 3) was committing or attempting to commit an offense under [O.C.G.A.] Chapter 5 of Title 16. 
                  (d)  Classification by animal control. The animal control officer shall make a determination whether the dog shall be classified as a dangerous dog or vicious dog. The owner shall be given notice of the classification pursuant to paragraph (e) below. If an owner is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be made by posting the notice in a conspicuous place at the location where the animal was confiscated. 
                  (e)  Notice of determination. The notice to the owner shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  The notice shall be in writing and mailed by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the owner's last known address within 72 hours, and notice shall be complete upon mailing; 
                  (2)  The notice shall include a summary of the animal control officer's findings that formed the basis for the dog's classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog; 
                  (3)  The notice shall be dated and shall state that the owner, within 15 days after the date shown on the notice, has a right to request an appeal hearing on the animal control officer's classification of the dog; 
                  (4)  The notice shall state that the hearing, if requested, shall be before the Bartow County Animal Control Board; 
                  (5)  The notice shall state that if a hearing is not requested, the classification of the dog as a dangerous dog or vicious dog will become effective for all purposes under this chapter on a date specified in the notice, which shall be after the last day on which the owner has a right to request a hearing; and 
                  (6)  The notice shall include a form to request a hearing and shall provide specific instructions on mailing or delivering such request to animal control. 
                  (f)  Response to notice. If no owner comes forward in response to the notice provided in paragraph (e), the animal shall be kept for five days, and then may be disposed of by animal control, including by humane destruction in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. If the owner comes forward and no appeal hearing is requested, the animal may be returned to the owner provided the owner complies with the requirements of this division, including payment of fees set forth in paragraph (j) and the requirements of section 14-67. If a hearing is requested, the provisions of paragraph (g) shall apply. 
                  (g)  Appeal hearing. When the animal control board receives a proper and timely request for an appeal hearing of a classification, it shall schedule such hearing within 30 days after receiving the request; however, such hearing may be continued by the authority for good cause shown. The board shall notify the dog owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of the date, time, and place of the hearing, and such notice shall be mailed to the dog owner at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. At the hearing, the owner of the dog shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence, and in addition thereto, the governing authority or board shall receive such other evidence and hear such other testimony as the governing authority or board may find reasonably necessary to make a determination either to sustain, modify, or overrule the animal control officer's classification of the dog, including the power to impose conditions on continued possession of the dog. 
                  (h)  Decision. After hearing the evidence, the animal control board shall be empowered to take the following actions: 
                  (1)  Sustain the animal control officer's classification; 
                  (2)  Modify the animal control officer's classification; 
                  (3)  Overrule the animal control officer's classification; 
                  (4)  Impose conditions or restrictions in addition to the required conditions set forth in this chapter for keeping a classified dog; or 
                  (5)  Order that the dog be euthanized pursuant to subsection 14-66(a)(3) if the requirements are met. 
                  (i)  Notice of decision. The decision shall be made at the hearing, and within ten days after the date of the hearing, the animal control board shall notify the dog owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of its determination on the matter. If such determination is that the dog is a dangerous dog or vicious dog, the notice shall specify the date upon which that determination is effective. Any specific additional conditions or restrictions shall be set forth in the notice. If the determination is that the dog is to be euthanized pursuant to subsection 14-66(a)(3), the notice shall specify the date by which the euthanasia shall occur. 
                  (j)  Return to owner. In the event the dog is classified as dangerous or vicious dog, (and the dog is not ordered euthanized), the animal shall not be returned to the owner until payment of reasonable confiscation costs, including an impoundment fee of $100.00, boarding costs of $15.00 per day, and all actual veterinary care costs. In the event the owner has not complied with the provisions of this paragraph and also satisfied the requirements set forth in section 14-67 within ten days of the date the dog was classified, said dog shall be destroyed in an expeditious and humane manner in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1; provided, however, upon a showing for good cause, the director of animal control may extend said time, up to an additional 15 days, upon the payment by the owner of the per diem boarding costs for said dog. In the event the dog is ordered euthanized, the animal shall be humanely destroyed any time after five business days after the date of the decision of the animal control board in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (k)  Judicial review. Judicial review of the animal control board's final decision may be had in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 50-13-19, except that venue shall be limited to the Bartow County Superior Court. The filing of the petition for judicial review in superior court does not itself stay enforcement of the board's decision. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the animal control director may grant, or the reviewing court may order, a stay upon appropriate terms for good cause shown.

The owner of a similarly classified dog who moves into this state and county from another state shall register the dog within 30 days of becoming a resident. 
                  (f)  Investigation and compliance. The animal control officer is authorized to make whatever inquiry is deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this section.

Certificates of registration shall be renewed on an annual basis. At the time of the annual renewal of a certificate of registration, the animal control officer shall require evidence from the owner or make such investigation as may be necessary to verify that the classified dog is continuing to be confined in a proper secure enclosure and that the owner is continuing to comply with other requirements of this chapter. Failure to renew a certificate of registration within ten days of the renewal date or initial classification date shall constitute a violation of this article. 
                  (h)  Liability; sovereign immunity. Issuance of a certificate of registration or the renewal of a certificate of registration by Bartow County does not warrant or guarantee that the requirements specified in this section are maintained by the owner of a classified dog on a continuous basis following the date of the issuance of the initial certificate of registration or following the date of any annual renewal of such certificate. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-31, under no circumstances shall the county or any county employee be held liable for any damages to any person who suffers an injury inflicted by a dog as a result of failure to enforce the provisions of this division.

In the event a hearing is requested, the hearing shall be to determine if the animal shall be destroyed or if there is any other option to spare the animal's life.

                  Sec. 14-83. - Notice of impoundment; procedures. 
                  (a)  Specific impoundments. Impoundment for violation of subsection 14-41(a) (failure to provide humane care) or section 14-43 (cruelty to animals) of this chapter, or for violations of O.C.G.A. § 16-12-4 (cruelty to animals) or § 16-12-37 (dogfighting), shall be subject to the following procedures: 
                  (1)  Veterinary determination. A licensed, accredited veterinarian approved according to O.C.G.A § 4-11-9.2(d) shall examine and determine the condition or treatment of the animal prior to impoundment. 
                  (2)  Notice. Notice shall be provided to the owner and shall include the description of the animal, the location where the animal was impounded, the reason for impoundment, the citation number if a citation was issued, the name and business address of the officer impounding the animal, the name and business location of the animal shelter, the hours during which the animal can be reclaimed, and fees to be charged to the owner. The notice shall state that the failure to claim the animal or request a hearing as hereinafter provided within five business days following the date notice was provided may result in the disposition of the animal. The notice shall be delivered personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If an owner is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be made by posting the notice in a conspicuous place at the location where the animal was impounded. In addition, if the owner is unknown, notice shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. 
                  (3)  Appeal hearing. If an animal is impounded pursuant to subsection 14-41(a) or section 14-43 and the owner thereof refuses to enter into a consent agreement with the animal shelter that such animal will be given humane care and adequate and necessary veterinary care, the owner may request, in writing, a hearing within five business days of the date the notice of impoundment was served on such owner, or, if the owner is unknown or could not be found, within 30 days of the date of publication of the notice of impoundment in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. Hearing shall be in accordance with section 14-84. Such request for hearing shall be served upon the animal shelter. If no hearing is requested within the time limits herein specified and the failure to request such hearing is due in whole or in part to the reasonably avoidable fault of the owner, the right to a hearing shall have been waived. For impoundments under state charges, see paragraph (c) below. 
                  (4)  Consent agreement. Prior to release of an animal impounded under these provisions, the owner must enter into a consent agreement providing that, among other things, the animal will be given humane care and veterinary treatment; the animal will not be subject to mistreatment or illegal activity; and the owner will comply with all terms of this chapter. Animal control may specify additional terms as required. 
                  (b)  Impoundment for other reasons. Impoundments for reasons other than specified in subsection 14-83(a) shall be subject to the following procedures. 
                  (1)  Determination. The animal control officer shall make a determination whether the animal should be impounded under this chapter. 
                  (2)  Notice. Notice shall be provided to the owner and shall include the description of the animal, the location where the animal was impounded, the reason for impoundment, the citation number if a citation was issued, the name and business address of the officer impounding the animal, the name and business location of the animal shelter, the hours during which the animal can be reclaimed, and fees to be charged to the owner. The notice shall state that the failure to claim the animal or request a hearing as hereinafter provided within five business days following the date notice was provided may result in the disposition of the animal. The notice shall be delivered personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If an owner is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be made by posting the notice in a conspicuous place at the location where the animal was impounded. 
                  (3)  Reclaim animal. The owner of an impounded animal, unless otherwise specified in this chapter, shall have the option to pay the violation fines and impoundment fines and retrieve the dogs, once the condition or circumstance causing the impoundment has been cured or corrected. Owners shall have no more than five days from the date of notice to cure or correct the violation, or the dogs shall be deemed unclaimed; this time limit may be extended by animal control, to no more than 20 days. Return to the owner upon payment of fees shall not be an option for animals that are a threat to public safety or health, require quarantine, or where impounded for cruelty, inhumane treatment, dog-fighting, other illegal action, vicious attacks, or other circumstances requiring a hearing under this chapter. 
                  (4)  Appeal hearing. The animal owner may request, in writing, a hearing within five business days of the date the notice of impoundment was served on such owner or being posted in the case of abandoned dogs. Hearings shall be in accordance with section 14-84. Such request for hearing shall be served upon the animal shelter. If no hearing is requested within the time limits herein specified and the failure to request such hearing is due in whole or in part to the reasonably avoidable fault of the owner, the right to a hearing shall have been waived. 
                  (5)  Consent agreement. Prior to release of an animal impounded under these provisions, the owner must enter into a consent agreement providing that, among other things, the animal will be given humane care and veterinary treatment; the animal will not be subject to mistreatment or illegal activity; and the owner will comply with all terms of this chapter. Animal control may specify additional terms as required. 
                  (c)  Criminal matters; bond. The provisions of paragraphs (a)4. or (b)5. of this section shall not apply to an animal that was an object or instrumentality of a crime nor shall any such animal be returned to the owner without the approval of the prosecuting attorney and animal control. If dogs are impounded for violation of O.C.G.A. § 16-12-4 (cruelty to animals) or 16-12-37 (dogfighting), they shall not be returned to the owner until the case is completed, or unless otherwise ordered by the court. In such cases, the owner shall be required to post a surety bond for the costs of impoundment of the dog for the duration of the proceeding, in the amount of $2,500.00 per animal impounded, or shall release the animals to animal control for disposal. The surety bond shall be issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state, or the bond may be paid in cash. If bond is not posted within 30 days of impoundment, animal control shall apply to the court for permission to dispose of the animal prior to trial of the criminal case as provided by law. 
                  (d)  Owners liable for fees. In the event an animal is not claimed from impoundment and is therefore destroyed or the animal otherwise dies, and the owner is known, the owner shall still be responsible for the impoundment charges, including boarding fees and veterinary care costs, for the period the animal was held.

                  Sec. 14-84. - Appeal hearings on impoundments. 
                  Procedures. Within 30 days after receiving a written request for a hearing, the animal control board shall hold a hearing following the procedures established in this chapter: 
                  (1)  The scope of the hearing shall be limited to whether the impounding of the animal was authorized under this chapter or state law; 
                  (2)  If the board finds that the animal was improperly impounded, the animal shall be returned to the owner and the costs incurred in providing reasonable care and treatment for the animal from the date of impoundment to the date of the order shall not be charged to the owner. If the animal is impounded under contract with a third party, the animal shelter shall pay for such costs of boarding and treatment; 
                  (3)  If the board finds that the animal was lawfully impounded, the board may (a) recommend the shelter dispose of the animal in accordance with this section or (b) unless, in a prior administrative or legal action, the owner has been found to have failed to provide humane care to an animal, committed cruelty to animals, or engaged in dog fighting in violation of the laws of this state or of the United States or any of the several states, recommend conditions under which the animal may, upon payment by the owner of all costs of impoundment and care, be returned to the owner. Such conditions shall be reduced to writing and served upon the owner and the animal shelter. 
                  (Ord. of 7-11-2012, Att.) 
                  Sec. 14-85. - Return of animal to owner. 
                  (a)  Return of animals at large. If the name of the owner of an animal found at large is known or can be obtained with reasonable dispatch, and there are no other violations of this chapter, the animal control officer shall return the animal to the residential address of the owner. If there is no one present, the officer shall impound the animal and leave written notice of whom the owner must contact to reclaim the animal. The owner shall be cited for violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Return of animals with violations. If an animal is impounded for a violation, and the procedure for return is not otherwise specified in this chapter or a hearing is not otherwise requested or required, the animal shall be returned once all fees for the violation and impoundment are paid and the conditions necessitating the impoundment have been cured or corrected, if applicable. 
                  (c)  Impoundment fees. An owner reclaiming an impounded animal shall pay a $30.00 impoundment fee plus a fee of $15.00 for each day the animal is impounded as a boarding fee if impounded at the shelter (or the actual costs of impoundment if impounded off-site), and the actual veterinary costs for care of the animal. 
                  (d)  Second impoundment. An owner reclaiming an impounded animal for a second impoundment within one year shall pay a $60.00 impoundment fee, plus a fee of $15.00 for each day the animal is impounded as a boarding fee (or the actual costs of impoundment if impounded off-site), plus any actual veterinary costs for care of the animal. 
                  (e)  Third and subsequent impoundment. An owner reclaiming an impounded animal for a third or subsequent impoundment within one year shall pay a $120.00 impoundment fee, plus a fee of $15.00 for each day the animal is impounded as a boarding fee (or the actual costs of impoundment if impounded off-site), plus any actual veterinary costs for care of the animal.

                  Sec. 14-86. - Unclaimed animals. 
                  (a)  Disposal of unclaimed animals. Except as provided below, after five business days, any animal unclaimed by its owner, after such owner has been notified of the impoundment of such animal or the conclusion of proceedings before the animal control board, shall be placed for adoption or humanely destroyed in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (b)  Disposal of animals without known owners. Except as provided below, after three business days, any animal whose owner cannot be ascertained shall be placed for adoption or humanely destroyed in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (c)  Disposal of animals without known owners for certain specific violations. If the animal has been impounded pursuant to subsection 14-83(a) of this chapter and if the owner is unknown or could not be found within 30 days of publication of the notice of impoundment, the animal shelter may dispose of the animal through sale by any commercially feasible means, at a public auction or by sealed bids. If in the opinion of a licensed accredited veterinarian or a veterinarian employed by the state or federal government any animal impounded pursuant to this chapter has a temperament or condition such that euthanasia is the only reasonable course of action, the animal shelter shall dispose of the animal in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (d)  Owners liable for fees. In the event an animal is not claimed from impoundment and is therefore destroyed or the animal otherwise dies, and the owner is known, the owner shall still be responsible for the impoundment charges, including boarding fees and veterinary care costs, for the period the animal was held.

Failure to comply with this agreement shall be a violation for each day beyond 30. 
                  (d)  Evidence required. Any person acquiring an animal from the animal shelter or humane society, which animal is not sterile at the time of acquisition, shall submit to the animal shelter or humane society a signed statement from the licensed veterinarian performing the sterilization required by subsection (a) within seven days after such sterilization attesting that such sterilization has been performed.

                  (a)  Variances. Variances may be granted by animal control in cases where undue hardship would result from the strict enforcement of this chapter and where the protection of the health and well being of the citizens of Bartow County can be achieved with reasonable mitigating actions. Hardships created by action of the applicant shall not be considered as a justification for a variance. Denial of a request for a variance may be appealed to the animal control board by filing a notice of appeal specifying the grounds for appeal with the animal control board within 15 days of the denial. 
                  (b)  Notice of variance appeal. Persons who appeal to the animal control board the denial of a variance from any requirement of this chapter shall notify adjacent property owners of their application for a variance and the time and location of the hearing on the variance appeal. Adjacent property owners shall be determined by the records of the tax assessor, on the date of the application for variance. 
                  (c)  Appeals.

                  Construction of industrialized homes is regulated by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs and not this article. However, installation of homes must meet manufacturer's specifications and the specifications of the zoning ordinance before permanent utilities may be installed. An installation permit must be obtained prior to installation and an inspection must occur of the installation, including utility connections and foundation, prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
                  (1)  Installation requirements. Industrialized homes must be installed in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 8-2-110 et seq. and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
                  (2)  Utility connections. Utility connections prior to the final inspection of the installation will be considered temporary and will be approved only when arrangements for complete installations have been made.

                  Signs more than 100 square feet must have plans submitted for the structure and its footings, and signs requiring a separate electrical meter must have a permit. Plans required to be submitted shall be stamped by a professional engineer. Due to the unique design and engineering of signs, the inspection only includes those parameters involved with the footing and electrical metering of the signs. It is the contractor's sole responsibility to assure that the sign is constructed to the engineered drawing specifications. It is the owner's responsibility to make sure the sign is kept in a safe state of repair.

                  Sec. 18-127. - Moved houses. 
                  A house moved to another location in Bartow County (or a house moved into Bartow County from another county) must have the necessary improvements made so as to be in compliance with the standard building codes that are in effect for new construction at the time the home is placed in its new location. Where any particular improvements that would be required to the moved house are technically unfeasible or impractical, or would be cost prohibitive (especially in relation to the benefit received or the purpose, goal, or intent of the standard or regulation at issue), a written request may be made to the building official requesting an exemption from the particular standard or requirement, and detailing why the request for exemption is being submitted. The building official may grant exemption, if reasonable, or may deny the exemption. Any denial may be appealed to the construction board of adjustment and appeals pursuant to division 13. The exemption granted should not impair the public safety purposes of the standard building codes and should be the minimum necessary.

                  Sec. 18-128. - Prohibited exterior materials; temporary repair exception. 
                  It shall be unlawful to use roof or wall covering material that has not been approved by the applicable building code as exterior covering material except in the event a building is damaged by natural or manmade disaster, or suffers a roof leak, other leak, or other damage. In such cases, temporary materials may be applied to a building to provide a temporary repair for no more than 60 days from the date of the damage. One 60-day extension can be requested from the building official, for cause, if the structure is not able to be properly repaired with approved exterior covering material within 60 days. Examples of materials that are not approved as exterior covering materials include, but are not limited to, tarpaulins, plastic sheeting, and OSB. This restriction shall not apply to [a] building that would not require a building permit to construct, such as outbuildings and storage buildings.

                  Sec. 18-129. - Partially-built structures. 
                  The county finds that partially-built and subsequently abandoned homes and other building and structures are occurring more frequently and are an aesthetic harm to the community; they also reduce property values of adjacent and nearby property; they create a public safety hazard in that they can be dangerous; and they invite illicit activity. The county finds such structures to be a nuisance. Therefore, it shall be unlawful for a property owner to leave a residential, commercial or industrial structure in a partially-built status for more than six months with no substantial progress occurring on the construction. Partially-built means foundations that are poured or erected; basements that have been dug and partially completed; and structures that have been framed or dried-in (siding, roofing, windows and doors in place) but not completed. For homes that have been damaged by fire or disaster after completion, see section 10.1 of appendix A, the zoning ordinance. It shall be permissible to finish the exterior of a commercial shopping center or other commercial or industrial building without building-out the inside. It shall also be a violation for a partially completed building or structure to remain unfinished without a certificate of occupancy more than 30 days after the expiration of its building permit (building permits expire one year from issuance unless extended; see section 18-168). The building official shall be authorized to issue citations to the property owner or builder, and shall be authorized to seek abatement of the nuisance in magistrate court or superior court.

                  Sec. 18-130. - Commercial car washes. 
                  Effective January 1, 2011, any commercial conveyor car wash (as defined herein) that is permitted and constructed, shall install a recycled water system which captures and reuses water previously used in wash or rinse cycles. A minimum of 50 percent of the water utilized shall be recycled. A "commercial conveyor car wash" is a commercial car wash where the car moves on a conveyor belt during the wash (regardless of whether the driver remains in the vehicle or not). These restrictions shall not apply to self-service car wash bays or in-bay car washes where the car remains stationary and the wash equipment moves around the vehicle.

                  Sec. 18-131. - Retaining walls. 
                  (a)  Permit required. A building permit shall be required for any retaining wall that exceeds three feet in exposed wall height, or exceeds two feet in exposed wall height and supports a surcharge. A building permit application shall require a site plan showing the location, extent, and height of the retaining wall in relations to any building structure, pool, property lines, and public utility easements. It shall also require complete construction details of the retaining wall, and structural calculations for the wall, both stamped and signed by a professional engineer. 
                  (b)  Definitions. 
                  Retaining wall: A wall designed to resist lateral earth and/or fluid pressures, including any surcharge, in accordance with accepted engineering practice. 
                  Surcharge: A vertical load imposed on the retained soil that may impose a lateral force in addition to the lateral earth pressure of the retained soil. Examples of surcharges include sloping retained soil, structure footings supported by the retained soil, adjacent vehicle loads supported by the retained soil, and solid fences that are attached or directly adjacent to a retaining wall when wind pressures act on the fence. 
                  Exposed wall height: The vertical distance measure from the finish grade at the bottom of the wall (lower soil grade) to the finish grade at the top of the wall (upper soil grade). This height does not include the wall and depth of footing below grade. 
                  (c)  Tiered retaining walls. Use of tiered walls is a special condition where two or more short walls, horizontally offset from one another, are used in lieu of a single tall retaining wall. When tiered walls are not properly offset from each other, the upper wall may impose a surcharge condition on the lower wall. In order for the walls to be treated as separate retaining walls, a general rule of thumb is that the tiered walls be horizontally offset by a minimum distance of two times the exposed wall height of the lower wall. For example, two tiered retaining walls, each with an exposed wall height of three feet and level backfill, which are horizontally offset by a distance of two feet, would be treated as a single six-foot-tall wall. As a result, a building permit would be required.

If permit is not properly posted, no scheduled inspections will occur, and a re-inspection fee will be charged before any further inspections will be scheduled. In the event of damage or loss, a replacement permit shall be immediately obtained and displayed. This permit card shall be maintained in such position by the permit holder until the certificate of occupancy or completion is issued by the building official.

                  (2)  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant; 
                  (3)  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other building, structure or service systems; 
                  (4)  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service systems; and

                  Variances cannot be given to totally remove a requirement or to exempt a property or applicant entirely from a requirement. If a variance is being sought that is, in the judgment of the building official, a request that would constitute a text amendment, then the application shall not be accepted. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance is contradictory to the ordinance (such as reducing a requirement to zero or totally eliminating a requirement). The applicant shall instead be directed to file for a text amendment. Generally, variances can only be given to alter a numeric value, unless otherwise specified. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance seeks something that cannot be varied.

                  It shall be unlawful for the owner and/or occupant of a lot or tract of land in Bartow County, or for any agent or representative of any such occupant or owner, to permit or maintain on such lot any growth of undesirable vegetation or an accumulation of weeds, trash, junk, filth, or other unsanitary, unsafe, or unfit conditions as to constitute an endangerment to public health or a general nuisance which renders adjacent real estate unsafe or inimical to safe human habitation. The complaint and inspection of undesirable vegetation shall be as set forth in section 18-558 of this article. 
                  (Ord. of 1-3-2007(2)) 
                  Sec. 18-558. - Complaint and inspection; in rem proceedings. 
                  (a)  Whenever a request is filed with the code enforcement officer by a public authority, or by at least five residents of the incorporated area of Bartow County, that any dwelling, building, structure, or property: 1) is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; 2) is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; 3) constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions; 4) has an accumulation of weeds, trash, junk, filth, and other unsanitary or unsafe conditions constituting a public health hazard or a general nuisance to those persons residing in the vicinity; 5) constitutes a public nuisance; or 6) has one or more of the conditions defined in section 18-556 above, the code enforcement officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. The code enforcement officer may also inspect properties on his own information or determination regarding potential violations of this or other county ordinances. 
                  (b)  The code enforcement officer may, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists. The complaint may be filed and prosecuted by the county attorney or other designated attorney. The complaint may be filed in magistrate court, pursuant to that court's jurisdiction under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, or in Bartow Superior Court, under that court's general equitable jurisdiction. A summons and the complaint shall be served on all interested parties in such dwelling, building, or structure. 
                  (c)  The complaint shall: 
                  (1)  Identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; 
                  (2)  Identify the interested parties; 
                  (3)  State with particularity the factual basis for the action; and 
                  (4)  Contain a statement of the action sought by the code enforcement officer to abate the alleged nuisance, as well as other relief sought. 
                  (d)  The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction at a date and time certain and at a place as specified, depending on whether the complaint is filed in magistrate court or superior court. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for the hearing. 
                  (e)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; or is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions; or otherwise constitutes a public nuisance; then the court shall state in writing its findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, structure, or property can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, structure, or property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this provision, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in Chapter 39A of Title 43, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  In any action brought to enforce the provisions of this article, the county shall be entitled to its attorney's fees and other litigation costs, such to be a lien against the property, unless the court determines that the failure to comply with this article was substantially justified based on the record as a whole. 
                  (f)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the code enforcement officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed, or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The code enforcement officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of any building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (g)  If the code enforcement officer has the structure demolished, reasonable efforts shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any sale of such salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The code enforcement officer and the governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (h)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, attorney's fees and expenses awarded by the court, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (i)  The lien provided for in subsection (h) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection 18-559(c) of this article. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  (1)  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this article, the code enforcement officer shall transmit to the county tax commissioner a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner or other official who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically Chapter 4 of Title 48; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce liens imposed pursuant to this chapter in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 48-5-359.1 and 41-2-9(b). The county tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county whose lien is being collected. 
                  (2)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner of the final determination of costs in accordance with this chapter. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
                  (3)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this article shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this article together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority or county tax commissioner in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (j)  The governing authority may waive and release such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with Bartow County agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (k)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, but rather commences in magistrate court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A § 5-3-29. 
                  (l)  In addition to the procedures and remedies outlined above, the code enforcement officer may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, and life safety codes adopted by the county, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article. 
                  (m)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the county to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

                  (3)  A copy of the complaint shall be posted on the property within three business days of filing the complaint and at least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing.

                  (c)  A notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county in which the dwelling, building, or structure is located at the time of filing the complaint in the appropriate court. Such notice shall have the same force and effect as other lis pendens notices provided by law. 
                  (d)  Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this article on any interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing.

In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the county and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the county commissioner may declare a local emergency for Bartow County.

                  (b)  Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of local emergency, the commissioner may request the governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the county to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster. 
                  (c)  Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the commissioner finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the commissioner shall execute and file with the clerk of the commissioner a document marking the end of the state of emergency. No state of local emergency shall continue for longer than 30 days, unless renewed by the commissioner. The commissioner may, by resolution, end a state of local emergency at any time.

                  (3)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties. 
                  (b)  Emergency powers.

                  (c)  Authority to waive procedures and fees. Pursuant to a declaration of emergency, the commissioner is authorized to cause to be effective any of the subsections of section 26-33 of this article as appropriate. The implementation of such subsections shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the commissioner. 
                  (d)  Additional emergency powers. The commissioner shall have, and may exercise for such period as the declared emergency exists or continues, the following additional emergency powers: 
                  (1)  To direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area, for the preservation of life or other disaster mitigation, response or recovery;

                  (8)  To suspend any law, code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension; 
                  (9)  To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes; 
                  (10)  To perform and exercise such other functions, powers and duties as may be deemed necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population, including individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during and following a major disaster or emergency.

                  (b)  Public works contracts. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or county commissioner, the commissioner may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest, responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract for four weeks; provided, however, that the emergency must be of such nature that immediate action is required and that the action is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

                  Sec. 34-31. - Title. 
                  This article shall be known as the "Bartow County Floodplain Management/Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. of 10-10-2007, § 101) 
                  Sec. 34-32. - Introduction. 
                  The flood hazard areas of Bartow County are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
                  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can (1) Protect human life and health; (2) Minimize damage to private property; (3) Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, Bartow County, Georgia, does ordain this ordinance and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
                  (Ord. of 10-10-2007, § 102) 
                  Sec. 34-33. - Description. 
                  Floodplain management involves the designation of flood-prone areas and the managing of their uses. It is also aimed at minimizing modifications to streams, reducing flood hazards, and protecting the beneficial uses of the floodplain such as water quality protection. As such, floodplain management can be seen as a subset of the larger consideration of surface water and stormwater management. Floodplain regulations and development restrictions can greatly reduce future flooding impacts, preserve greenspace and habitat, and protect their function in safely conveying floodwaters and protecting water quality. This article aims to help the county integrate floodplain management with stormwater management during the land development process. 
                  The article requires that the county regulate the floodplains that will be expected with future land-use conditions, which are based upon the communities adopted future land use map, zoning, or watershed study projections. The ordinance also requires the county to regulate floodplains on all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres and greater. 
                  In order to administer the ordinance, "future-conditions" floodplains must be established: 
                  (1)  Future-conditions floodplains for streams with a drainage area of one square mile (640 acres) and greater in size are to be delineated by the local jurisdiction. As required in the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, district-Wide Watershed Management Plan, cities and counties are expected to model and map at least ten percent of their area each year until future-conditions floodplains have been established for the entire community. 
                  (2)  For streams with a drainage area between 100 acres and 640 acres, the local jurisdiction shall model and map the future-conditions floodplains or require the future-conditions floodplains be determined on a per development basis by the applicant. 
                  (3)  For development projects in watersheds of any size where future-conditions floodplains have not yet been established, the applicant will be required to determine the future-conditions floodplain boundaries located on their property in accordance with approved methodologies and in compliance with this ordinance.

                  Secs. 34-34—34-40. - Reserved. 
                  DIVISION 2. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Sec. 34-41. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and, 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this article. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term includes any structure commonly referred to as a "mobile home" regardless of the date of manufacture. The term also includes parked trailers, travel trailers and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) and/or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced after March 22, 1989. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after March 22, 1989. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  Owner means the legal or beneficial owner of a site, including but not limited to, a mortgagee or vendee in possession, receiver, executor, trustee, lessee or other person, firm or corporation in control of the site. 
                  Permit means the permit issued by the county engineering department to the applicant which is required prior to undertaking any development activity. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is: 
                  (a)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (b)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (c)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by light duty truck; and, 
                  (d)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the development project is located. 
                  Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately orin the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the building official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) below. 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and, 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the engineering department until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the engineering department.

                  (4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (7)  In reviewing such requests, the engineering department and board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (8)  Conditions for variances: 
                  a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  (i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  (ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
                  (iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  b.  The provisions of this ordinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  d.  The county engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the engineering department and board of appeals shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.

                  DIVISION 8. - VIOLATIONS, ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES 

                  Sec. 34-111. - Notice of violation. 
                  Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this article or the requirements of an approved stormwater management plan or permit may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this [division]. Any such action or inaction that is continuous with respect to time is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this article. Actions may be filed in superior court to seek injunctive relief, and to seek fines up to $1,000.00 per day per violation, and to seek costs of abatement, and attorney's fees and costs for bringing the action. 
                  If the engineering department determines that an applicant or other responsible person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, an approved stormwater management plan or the provisions of this article, it may issue a written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person, or may take such other actions as are authorized below. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by this article without having first secured a permit therefore, the notice of violation may be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of the activity being conducted on the site. Persons actually conducting the activity may also be served with a notice of violation. 
                  The notice of violation shall contain: 
                  (1)  The name and address of the owner or the applicant or the responsible person; 
                  (2)  The address or other description of the site upon which the violation is occurring; and 
                  (3)  A statement specifying the nature of the violation, and the time limit to correct the violation. 
                  The notice of violation may contain: 
                  (1)  A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the action or inaction into compliance with the permit, the stormwater management plan or this ordinance and the date for the completion of such remedial action; 
                  (2)  A statement of the penalty or penalties that may be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed; and, 
                  (3)  A requirement for payment of civil fines.

                  In the event the remedial measures described in the notice of violation have not been completed by the date set forth for such completion in the notice of violation, any one or more of the following actions or penalties may be taken or assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation was directed. The following actions may be taken after a notice of violation has been issued, or may be taken without a notice of violation first being issued, as is appropriate in the judgment of the officials of the engineering department to achieve the purposes of this ordinance and protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
                  (1)  Stop work order. The engineering department may issue a stop work order which shall be served on the applicant or other responsible person. A stop work order may be issued after a notice of violation or may be issued in conjunction with a notice of violation. The stop work order shall remain in effect until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth indicated in the order or notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violation or violations described therein. 
                  a.  Stop work orders shall affect all work being done on a project or development (including work done on other lots in the subdivision owned by the same violator). Stop work orders stop not only the work in violation, but all other work by contractors or sub-contractors on the same property. Only work to remedy the deficiency shall be allowed until the stop work order is lifted. 
                  b.  A stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency or other exigent circumstances exist, no written notice shall be required, and a verbal stop work order may be issued, with a written order to be provided within three working days. 
                  c.  Stop work orders may be issued on their own, or in conjunction with criminal citations, or civil proceedings in superior court. 
                  (2)  Withhold building permits or certificate of occupancy. The engineering department may advise the building inspections department to refuse to issue building permits or certificates of occupancy for the buildings or other improvements constructed or being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein. 
                  (3)  Suspension, revocation or modification of permit. The engineering department may suspend, revoke or modify the permit authorizing the land development project. A suspended, revoked or modified permit may be reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated [upon such conditions as the department may deem necessary] to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations. 
                  (4)  Civil penalties. In the event the applicant or other responsible person fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within ten days, or such shorter or longer period as the engineering department shall deem appropriate depending on the severity of the situation (at a minimum 24 hours unless the situation is a severe emergency), the engineering department may impose a penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. If unpaid, the county may seek enforcement of such penalties in superior or magistrate court. Civil fines may also be sought in actions filed in superior court for injunctive relief, whether or not a notice of violation was issued. 
                  (5)  Criminal penalties.

                  Sec. 34-253. - Statement of purpose. 
                  Soil erosion and sediment deposition onto lands and into waters within the watersheds of this county are continuing to occur as a result of widespread failure to apply proper soil erosion and sedimentation control practices in land clearing, soil movement, and construction activities. Such erosion and sediment deposition result in pollution of county waters and damage to domestic, agricultural, recreational, fish and wildlife, and other resource uses. Improperly controlled soil erosion and sedimentation are a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare. It is therefore declared to be the policy of this county and the intent of this article to strengthen and extend the present erosion and sediment control activities and programs of this county and the state, and to provide for the establishment and implementation of a comprehensive soil erosion and sediment control program to conserve and protect the land, water, air, and other resources of this county.

                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and/or maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the county or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the county or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements that [than] stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical practicable erosion potential. 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to the erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable. 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. Exposed areas shall be vegetated or otherwise stabilized within seven days after disturbance. Temporary vegetation cannot be used as permanent vegetation. 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable. 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1. 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills. 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills that deposit sediment on adjoining property are prohibited; cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
                  (12)  Cuts and fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners. 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are not feasible, provided in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum. 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section. 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-5, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream, cause of width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications, and are implemented: i) stream crossings for water lines; ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines;. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (f)  Additional requirements. 
                  (1)  Allowing visible amounts of sediment to flow onto an adjoining property, into the waters of the state, or across any downstream property, shall constitute a violation of this article. 
                  (2)  In addition to BMPs, all land-disturbing activities subject to this article shall be conducted in compliance with the county site and utility details for development, if applicable. 
                  (3)  Stabilization of all areas of erodible earth material shall occur weekly and shall not be exposed seven calendar days. 
                  (4)  Utility companies which are utilizing roadway shoulders for construction are required to maintain and/or stabilize the earth shoulders to within 300 feet of construction. Shoulder construction shall be stabilized every three days as a maximum period time. They are also required to stabilize the shoulder before leaving the work area on any particular day if rain is forecast within the next 24 hours. 
                  (5)  Tree protection fencing and two rows of Georgia DOT Type "C" wired back silt fence shall be installed at all locations where construction activity will be adjacent to a state water requiring a buffer. 
                  (6)  All silt fence installed shall be GDOT approved materials. 
                  (7)  Construction exits. A construction exit must be installed and maintained for any land disturbance or other construction occurring in the county. Such exit must be maintained while any construction and/or grading equipment will be leaving a construction site to a public right-of-way, street, alley, sidewalk or parking area until construction is completed. (The construction exit may be the same as the driveway exit.) The construction exit shall be graded such that drainage is directed away from any paved street or parking area. 
                  a.  Design and installation. The construction exit shall be designed and installed per the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. The pad may be required to be an additional width, length, and/or depth if, in the opinion of the county engineer, conditions so warrant. The pad shall be adequate to substantially eliminate the transport of mud from the construction site by either motor vehicles and/or equipment or from water run-off. 
                  b.  Contamination of roadways. Tracking or carrying soil onto the pavement of any county or state roadway, whether from the wheels of any vehicle or by any other means, shall constitute a violation of this article. The permit holder shall be responsible for any violation by any subcontractor or any party operating under his permit. All parties involved, including the property owner, the operator, the permit holder, the owner of the vehicle, and the operator of the vehicle, are subject to citation for this violation. This provision shall apply to all residential and non-residential construction, and all clearing and grading, and shall apply whether or not a land disturbance permit is required. 
                  c.  Clean up. Any materials or mud spilled, dropped, washed, or tracked from vehicles or from the site onto roadways or into storm drains must be removed within 24 hours or the county may perform any necessary corrective work and the owner/developer shall reimburse county for any expenses incurred. In the event the county undertakes the corrective work, no building permits for said development shall be issued until said expenses have been reimbursed to the county. 
                  d.  The fine for violation of this section shall be $1,000.00 per day, per exit. 
                  (g)  Continuing duty of builder or developer. In the event final stabilization has not been achieved (due to conditions beyond the control of the owner of the builder/developer), and a request for certificate of occupancy is approved for issuance for a building or structure, the builder and/or developer of the property shall have a continuing duty and responsibility under this article to insure final stabilization is complete as soon as possible, but in no event later than the period granted as a condition of the certificate of occupancy. Prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy by the county building official, an erosion permit shall be issued by the county engineer to the owner/developer. The builder/developer shall be responsible for materials and workmanship for the duration of the erosion permit to insure final stabilization. In the event, the owner, builder and/or developer are subsequently given notice for failing to comply with the requirements of this article the owner, builder/developer shall be required to immediately bring the property into compliance, or be subject to citation as stated in subsection 34-268(c). 
                  (h)  Construction site waste. Construction site operators must control waste such as discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary waste at the construction site that may cause adverse impacts to water quality. "Control waste" means to properly contain and dispose of waste in order to prevent it from washing into the stormwater system. Loose construction debris (e.g., packing materials, scraps of lumber, etc.) is prohibited.

                  Sec. 34-268. - Duty to maintain property. 
                  (a)  Application. This section applies to properties where no land-disturbing activity is occurring, and which are therefore not otherwise regulated by or subject to this article; for example, single-family residences and businesses that have been completed, issued a certificate of occupancy, and occupied. If other sections of this article are applicable to the activity or condition, this section shall not apply. 
                  (b)  Duty. Every property owner and resident of the county has a duty to maintain their property, or the property on which they reside, in a manner that prevents excessive erosion onto property or into water bodies not wholly owned by the property owner or resident. This duty requires that appropriate vegetation be maintained on all property to the extent necessary to minimize erosion. Allowing visible sedimentation to flow onto property of another, into county ditches or storm-drains, or into waters of the state, shall constitute a violation of this section. 
                  (c)  Penalty. A violation of this section may be cited by county enforcement officers and fined by the magistrate court $150.00 per occurrence. Each rain event may be cited as a separate occurrence.

                  Sec. 34-280. - General. 
                  Coordination with other ordinances. The property owner, operator, developer, and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans. The county shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. In addition to this article they shall review the county zoning ordinance, county stormwater management ordinance, county floodplain management/flood damage prevention ordinance, county development regulations, the county building code ordinance, and any other ordinances contained in the County Code which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. All references to other county ordinances shall refer to and incorporate the latest revision as set forth in the County Code. 
                  ( Ord. of 12-7-2016 ) 
                  Sec. 34-281. - Land disturbance permit application requirements. 
                  (a)  Land disturbance permit required. No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county without first obtaining a land disturbance permit from the county to perform such activity and shall provide to the county a copy of the NOI submitted to EPD if applicable. Application under this article should be made in conjunction with application for permits under the county stormwater management ordinance (sections 34-551 et seq.), as no land-disturbing activity can take place except in compliance with that ordinance. In addition, the applicant is required to comply with all applicable provisions of the ordinances listed in subsection 34-280(a). 
                  (b)  Application. The application for a land disturbance permit shall be submitted to the county and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 34-282 of this article. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
                  (c)  Fees. The county assesses local permitting fees and also state-mandated fees. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. 
                  (1)  Local permitting fees. Except as otherwise provided for herein, fees for an application for a permit on a per-acre of land disturbed basis, as required by this article, shall be as established by the commissioner of the county from time to time by resolution of the commissioner. 
                  (2)  State-mandated fees. In addition to the local permitting fees, state-mandated fees shall also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), one-half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (d)  Review by district. Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the county shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the county. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 34-267(c)(15) and (16) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 34-281(f), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (e)  Repeat violations; fraudulent submissions. 
                  (1)  Repeat violations. If a permit applicant, has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article (including predecessors), or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the county may deny the permit application. 
                  (2)  Fraudulent submissions. Fraudulent submissions are prohibited, and any falsehoods or misinformation on a permit application shall subject the application to rejection, and subject any permit to revocation. If a permit is granted to a person who is later determined by the county engineer to be a "strawman," (i.e., not the actual operator, but rather a front for the actual operator), the permit shall be revoked. 
                  (3)  Appeals of denials/revocations. Any person whose permit has been denied or revoked pursuant to this subsection may appeal to the board of zoning appeals. See section 34-299. Any applicant that wishes to appeal the decision of the board of zoning appeals may do so appealing to the county commissioner. See section 34-299. Any person aiding in an attempt to circumvent this paragraph may be cited for violation of this article. Whenever a permit is revoked pursuant to this subsection, the letter of credit posted pursuant to subsection (d) of this section may be called and funds therefrom used to stabilize the property subjected to land-disturbing activities. 
                  (f)  Surety requirements. The county shall require the permit applicant to post a surety in an amount equal to $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. The surety shall be in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof, in a format approved by the county. The surety requirement may be combined with other surety requirements of other provisions of the County Code relating to roads, storm water, utilities and others. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the county may draw against the surety or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, his surety may be drawn against as follows: 
                  (1)  Process and appeal. If the permit holder believes they are not in violation of this article such that the surety should not be drawn against, the permit holder shall have five days to appeal any notice to comply to the county commissioner. The appeal provisions of section 34-299 shall not apply to this decision. Appeal shall be made by filing a written notice of appeal with the county engineer stating the basis for the appeal. The commissioner shall consider the appeal as soon as possible, at a public meeting. Except in emergency situations, the surety shall not be drawn against until the appeal is considered. 
                  (2)  Partial release. The county engineer may release a portion of the letter of credit, for the land-disturbing amount, after final stabilization is complete and all permanent vegetation and stabilization measures are in place. Any portion of the letter of credit relating to roads, stormwater, utilities or other provisions of the County Code shall be governed by its particular section of the Code.

                  Sec. 34-282. - Plan requirements. 
                  (a)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 34-267(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (b)  Data required for EandS site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, hereby incorporated by reference into this article.

                  Sec. 34-283. - Permits. 
                  (a)  Timeframe on application. Land disturbance permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the county of a complete and valid application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fee have been paid prior to issuance. The permit shall include conditions, under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (b)  No issuance without compliance. No land disturbance permit shall be issued by the county unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the county has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 34-267(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, surety requirements per subsection 34-281(f) are met, and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the county are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished the applicant. 
                  (c)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (d)  Multi-phase developments. If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate land disturbance permit shall be required for each phase. Individual lots shall not count as separate phases. 
                  (e)  Suspension, revocation or modification. The land disturbance permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the county as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in title is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A land disturbance permit may be revoked upon a finding by the county engineer that the owner, operator, applicant or permit holder is in violation of the county zoning ordinance, or the county flood damage prevention Ordinance. A holder of a land disturbance permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. See subsection 34-297(a) of this article. 
                  (f)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (g)  Certification of payment of taxes. No land disturbance permit shall be issued unless the applicant provides a statement by the tax commissioner of the county certifying that all ad valorem taxes levied against the property and due and owing have been paid. 
                  (h)  Submission of false information. It shall be a violation of this article to make a false certification under sections 34-282 or 34-283 of this article, or to knowingly submit false information on a site plan or application for a land disturbance permit. 
                  (i)  No activity prior to permit issuance. It shall be unlawful to commence any land disturbance activity for the construction of any building; to commence construction of any building; to commence the moving or alteration of any building; or to commence the development of land for a use not requiring a building, until all necessary permits for such work have been issued. All land development or construction shall comply with the codes and ordinances in effect in the county at the time the permit is issued. 
                  (j)  Predesign meeting. Engineers and developers are required to schedule a predesign meeting with representatives of the development review committee for a consultation meeting at the time of the preliminary plan of subdivision or other early step in the development process. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss and assess constraints, opportunities and potential ideas for erosion control designs before the formal site design engineering is commenced. 
                  (k)  Preconstruction conference. Once the construction plans are approved, no permit for land disturbing activity will be issued to an applicant without the applicant first attending an on-site mandatory preconstruction conference with a representative from the county. 
                  (l)  Erosion and sediment control inspection permit. The county requires all new residential home sites and additions to obtain an erosion and sediment control inspection permit. This permit approval is required prior to undertaking any clearing activity as may be deemed necessary prior to the issuance of an approved residential drainage plan or building permit as outlined in the county development regulations (Appendix B to this Code). The requirements of said EandS inspection permit shall be met prior to recording of final plat, final as-built or release of a certificate of occupancy. Fees for this permit shall be as established by resolution of the county commissioner. 
                  (m)  Additional land disturbance permit requirements. In addition to the requirements of this article, the county requires all new development or redevelopment projects creating or replacing more than 5,000 square feet of impervious surface to obtain a stormwater management permit as required by the county stormwater management ordinance (section 34-551 et seq.). This permit is required prior to undertaking any clearing or grading activity for projects exceeding the above listed requirements. All stormwater management permits will be required to follow the construction erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan submitted and approved by the district (district approval required only on projects disturbing more than one acre) and county engineer. 
                  (n)  Properly displaying permits. Permits for all development must be displayed prior to beginning any clearing or grading for any residential or non-residential development project. All building permits must be displayed prior to beginning any building construction. Such permits must be placed on a post or other structure at least three feet off the ground and no more than two feet back from the right-of-way, so as to be easily visible to the inspectors and passers-by. Such permits must be encased in a waterproof container to protect them from the elements, and must be legible. The permittee shall be responsible for ensuring a clear and legible permit is on display at all times. In the event of damage or loss, a replacement permit shall be immediately obtained and displayed. Failure to comply with this provision shall result in an administrative fine of $250.00, and the permit and all subsequent inspections shall be suspended until such fine is paid. 
                  (o)  Monthly EandS report. Upon the issuance of the land disturbance permit, the operator shall ensure that a monthly erosion and sedimentation report outlining the status of the project is delivered to the county on or before the first business day of each month. The report will be prepared by a qualified professional engineer/architect/landscape architect/certified professional in erosion and sediment control (CPESC) or an individual meeting the education and certification requirements of section 34-312 of this article. At minimum, individuals involved in development inspections should be certified as Level 1B. All initial inspections and proposed modifications to structural practices (BMPs) shall be certified by a Level 2 design professional. Should this report not be received by 5:00 p.m. on the said dates, a stop work order along with an administrative fine of $250.00 may be issued for the project. The permit and all subsequent inspections shall be suspended until such fine is paid. Should the monthly project report fail to meet the requirements of this article, a five-day write up will be issued for the project and a follow up inspection may be required within five days of said report to ensure site is brought into compliance with the requirements of this article. Monthly reports are required to be submitted for the project or each phase of the project until proof of the notice of termination, as defined as "accepted" by the NPDES general permit, as filed with the Georgia EPD is submitted to the county. 
                  (p)  Residential drainage plan. A residential drainage plan (RDP) accepted by the county shall be required prior to issuance of a building permit on those lots subject to periodic or nuisance flooding or as labeled "RDP" on a final plat. The residential drainage plan shall meet the requirements as outlined in the county development regulations (Appendix B to this Code).

                  DIVISION 4. - INSPECTIONS, ENFORCEMENT, PENALTIES, VARIANCES, AND APPEALS 

                  Sec. 34-295. - Inspection. 
                  (a)  Generally. The county enforcement personnel will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the county shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a notice of violation (NOV) which may include a stop-work order, citation, civil fine, and/or a written notice to comply shall be served upon the that person(s) conducting the land-disturbing activity, in addition to any other remedy allowed under this article. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  Right of entry. The county engineering department and code enforcement personnel shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out the duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. The act of seeking a land disturbance permit shall act as consent for inspections on private property to observe whether the property is in compliance with this article. 
                  (d)  Refusal of access. No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
                  (g)  Re-inspection fees. For each compliance re-inspection made under this article, a re-inspection fee shall be paid by the permit holder. No building permits or any other necessary approvals shall be issued to or on behalf of the permit holder for any project until all violations have been corrected and approved and all outstanding fees are paid in full. Failure to pay the re-inspection fee constitutes a violation of this article. Fees for re-inspections as required by this subsection shall be as established by the commissioner of the county from time to time by resolution of the commissioner. 
                  ( Ord. of 12-7-2016 ) 
                  Sec. 34-296. - Enforcement. 
                  Enforcement of this article may be through notice to comply, criminal prosecution, civil administrative fines or other civil proceedings. Each day during which the violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall constitute a separate violation, subjecting the offender to a new civil administrative fine, or other civil or criminal proceeding. 
                  (1)  Criminal prosecution. The county engineer or his or her authorized representatives, including code enforcement personnel, may issue criminal citations for violations of this article or any stop-work order, or for any other violation of this article. 
                  a.  Criminal prosecutions for violation of this article upon citation shall be commenced by the completion, signing, and service of a citation by an authorized officer of the county planning and engineering department. The original of the citation shall be personally served upon the accused, his or her authorized representative or, if a corporation, an officer of the corporation or its on-site representative or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property; a copy shall be promptly filed with the magistrate court. 
                  b.  Each citation shall state the time and place at which the accused is to appear for trial in magistrate court, shall identify the offense with which the accused is charged, shall have an identifying number by which it shall be filed with the court, shall indicate the identity of the accused and the date of service, and shall be signed by the deputy sheriff or other authorized officer who completes and serves it. 
                  c.  Any defendant who fails to appear for trial shall thereafter be arrested on the warrant of the magistrate and required to post a bond for his or her future appearance. 
                  d.  The district attorney, county attorney, or another attorney designated by the county may act as prosecuting attorney for violations of this article. 
                  (2)  Civil administrative fine. 
                  a.  In lieu of proceeding with a criminal citation, the county engineer or an authorized officer of the county engineering department may issue a civil administrative fine. A civil administrative fine may be assessed for any violation of this article. Civil administrative fines for violation of this article shall be made by the completion, signing, and service of a civil violation form by an authorized officer of the county planning and engineering department. The original of the civil violation form shall be personally served upon the accused, his or her authorized representative or, if a corporation, an officer of the corporation or its on-site representative or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property; a copy shall be promptly filed with the engineering department. A stop-work order may be issued in conjunction with the civil administrative fine. 
                  b.  Any stop-work order issued in conjunction with a civil administrative fine shall not be lifted until the civil administrative fine is paid and the violation is corrected, if necessary to achieve compliance with the article. No land disturbance permit, building permit, or other permit under any county ordinance shall be granted until the fine is paid. 
                  c.  Fines shall be assessed in the amounts specified in subsection 34-297(d). 
                  d.  Civil administrative fines may be appealed pursuant to section 34-299. Payment of the fine at any time shall moot the appeal. 
                  (3)  Other civil proceedings; actions in superior court. In addition to or in lieu of any other remedy, any appropriate county authority, or any person who is an aggrieved person, or is or would be damaged by such violation, may seek injunctive, mandamus or other appropriate relief in superior court to enjoin or prevent a violation of any provision of this article. Such action may also seek civil fines at the rates specified in subsection 34-297(d) of this article for violation of this article, and may additionally seek any other costs associated with the action to enjoin or prevent any violation of any provision of this article. The county shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney's fees and costs for bringing an action in superior court against any operator, permit applicant, or permit holder wherein any relief is granted or fine assessed. 
                  (4)  Stop-work orders. 
                  a.  Notice. Upon notice from the county engineer or a duly authorized agent, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this article, or work done in a dangerous or unsafe manner, shall be immediately stopped. A stop-work order may be issued in conjunction with a criminal citation, a civil fine, or other judicial proceeding. 
                  b.  First and second violations; emergency situation. Except as otherwise noted below, for the first and second violations of any of the provisions of this article by the same violator (no matter whether on the same or different property or under the same or different permit), the director or the county shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected in five days, the director or the county shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until the necessary corrective actions or mitigation has occurred. provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  c.  For a third and each subsequent violation the director or the county shall issue an immediate stop-work order. 
                  d.  Emergency situation. Any violation of this article that (i) creates an emergency situation or (ii) poses an imminent threat to the public health or waters of the state, or (iii) any land-disturbing activities being conducted without a permit, shall be immediately subject to an emergency stop-work order, regardless of whether it is a first, second or subsequent violation. Such notice may be given verbally or in writing to the owner of the property, the operator, and/or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. A written version shall be provided as soon as practicable. 
                  e.  Additional immediate issuance circumstances. In addition to the circumstances described above, when a violation of this article occurs in the form of (i) taking action without a permit; (ii) failure to maintain a stream buffer; or (iii) significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the county or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been property designed installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be immediately issued by the county or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls and work to ensure the project site is left in a safe condition so as not to endanger life or damage adjacent properties. The county may erect a sign notifying all persons of the stop-work order, and removal of the sign shall be a violation of this article. 
                  (5)  Notice to comply; forfeiture of letter of credit. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply may be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his surety required under subsection 34-281(f). The county engineer may thereafter draw on the letter of credit or any part thereof and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  ( Ord. of 12-7-2016 ) 
                  Sec. 34-297. - Penalties. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county. Such action may be taken by the commissioner of the county, upon recommendation of the county engineer. 
                  (b)  Revocation, suspension, or modification of permit; other penalties. If any person commences any activity requiring a development permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said development permit, or if any person is found in violation of this article, or for any other reason given in subsection 34-283(e) of this article, the person shall be subject to revocation, suspension or modification of his development permit, in addition to other penalties provided herein. Such actions may be taken by the county engineer, who shall provide written notice to the permit holder. All actions of revocation, suspension or modification of permits, business licenses, work permits and other authorization pursuant to this section may be appealed pursuant to section 34-299 of this article. 
                  (c)  Withholding of certificates of occupancy. 
                  (1)  The county may refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or being constructed on the site where any violation of this article exists, until such time as the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures as set forth in the notice to comply or has otherwise cured the violation. 
                  (2)  When a particular applicant, property owner, or operator is in violation of any provision of this article on any site in the county, the county may withhold certificates of occupancy on all other sites where that applicant, property owner, or operator is seeking a certificate of occupancy, until all violations by said person are corrected. 
                  (3)  No certificates of occupancy shall be issued on any project or property where violations of this article are ongoing. This shall prevent issuance of a certificate of occupancy to an individual builder when the general subdivision development land disturbance permit is being violated. However, violations by other builders in that subdivision shall not prevent builders in compliance from receiving certificates of occupancy. 
                  (4)  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until final stabilization measures are in place, unless measures cannot be emplaced because of extenuating circumstances (i.e. extreme drought). In such instances a variance should be sought under section 34-298. In no event shall temporary vegetation be counted as permanent vegetation. Prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy, a plan shall be filed detailing the remaining final stabilization measures to be installed, and the timetable for installation (which in no event shall be longer than six months). Failure to finish installation and complete final stabilization by this timetable shall be a violation of this article for the builder/developer, and for the property owner. In the event of a variance granted to complete final stabilization after a certificate of occupancy is issued or other transfer of ownership occurs, or in the event final stabilization is not complete at such time for any reason, the builder/developer shall retain responsibility for compliance and final stabilization, in addition to the new owner of the property. 
                  (d)  Fines. Fines assessed under this article shall be assessed according to the following mandatory schedule, whether assessed as a civil administrative fine, or assessed as a criminal penalty upon conviction. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-15, notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violations. Each day during which the violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation. 
                  (1)  Maximum fines. Any person violating any provisions of this article, any permitting conditions, or any stop-work order shall be liable for a penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation, which may be assessed as a civil administrative fine or criminal penalty. In no event shall a fine be reduced below the mandatory minimum, as set in subsection (2) below. 
                  (2)  Mandatory minimum fines. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the following penalties are mandatory and shall be assessed for any land-disturbing activity performed in violation of any provision of this article or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article: 
                  a.  For any violation involving land-disturbing activities under this article, the minimum required fine shall be $1,000.00 per day for each violation. 
                  b.  For any violation of a stop-work order issued under this article, the minimum required fine shall be $2,000.00 per day for each violation. 
                  (3)  Repeat violator fines. As a deterrent to violation, third and subsequent violations by the same offender of any provision of this article, whether violations of the same or different provisions of this article as the initial violation, and whether involving the same or different property, shall increase the fine owing. However, repeated citations for the same violation on a second and subsequent days shall not count as a subsequent violation, but shall rather be assessed at the same rate as the initial violation. Multiple violations on the same day shall also be assessed at the same level. This same schedule shall apply to criminal penalties and civil administrative fines. 
                  a.  For the third or subsequent violation by any person involving land-disturbing activities under this article, the minimum required fine shall be $2,000.00 per day for each violation. 
                  b.  For the third or subsequent violation by any person of a stop-work order issued under this article, the minimum required fine shall be $2,500.00 per day for each violation. 
                  (e)  Additional criminal penalties. Persons cited criminally are also subject to the following criminal penalties: 
                  (1)  Incarceration. In addition to monetary penalties, any person cited with a criminal violation, and found guilty in magistrate court, may be punished by a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding 60 days in jail in addition to the minimum fine. 
                  (2)  Community service. In lieu of, or in addition to, any fine or incarceration, community service may be ordered by the magistrate court as punishment for a violation of this article. Said community service shall be not less than 20 hours but not more than 250 hours, which must be performed within a period set by the magistrate court, not to exceed one year from the date of conviction for a violation of this article. 
                  (3)  Any person placed on community service or otherwise placed on probation for a violation of this article shall pay such supervisory fees as may be authorized by law. 
                  ( Ord. of 12-7-2016 ) 
                  Sec. 34-298. - Variances. 
                  (a)  Process. Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be heard initially by the county engineer. Variances defined as available only from the EPD director cannot be granted by the county engineer. Any variance given by the director may also be required an additional variance approval by the county engineer, considering the criteria in this section, prior to implementation. See the county stream buffer protection ordinance. 
                  (b)  Criteria. In reviewing application for variances, the county engineer shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. A variance shall only be granted upon (i) a determination that the variance is the result of topography or other hardship beyond the applicant's control, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased erosion, stormwater run-off, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances; (iv) a determination that the variance will not have a negative impact based on the criteria in subsection (c) below; and (v) a determination the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief. A variance to allow permanent vegetation to be installed after issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall have a duration of no longer than six months. 
                  (c)  Specific negative impact factors. The specific negative impact factors to be considered are as follows: 
                  (1)  The possibility that, given the variance, erosion, sedimentation or stormwater run-off will affect or injure the lands of others; 
                  (2)  The danger to life and property due to erosion damage; 
                  (3)  The availability of alternative options, reconfigurations, and other measures that would achieve erosion and sedimentation control without a variance; 
                  (4)  The potential for increased maintenance costs subsequent to completion of the development; 
                  (5)  The negative impacts that the proposed variance would create; 
                  (6)  The purposes of the requirement and this article. 
                  (d)  Conditions. Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of this article, the county engineer may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as he deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
                  (e)  Appeals. Appeals of denial or grant of a variance may proceed according to section 34-299 of this article. 
                  ( Ord. of 12-7-2016 ) 
                  Sec. 34-299. - Administrative and judicial appeals. 
                  The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the county upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the zoning appeals board within as outlined in this section after receipt by the county of written notice of appeal. 
                  (1)  Appeals of decisions of the county engineer. The board of zoning appeals as established by the county pursuant to the county zoning ordinance shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the county engineer under this article, including any determination granting or denying a variance. Any aggrieved person as defined below shall be entitled to bring an appeal. 
                  (2)  Appeal process. Unless otherwise stated in the specific provision of this article, an appeal shall be initiated within 30 days of the decision by filing a written notice of appeal with the county engineer. The board of zoning appeals shall hold a hearing on the appeal within 35 days of the filing of the notice of appeal.

                  --- (5) --- 
                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted May 9, 2007, deleted Art. II, §§ 34-521—34-533, in its entirety and enacted a new art. II, §§ 34-521—34-528, to read as set out herein. Former Art. II, §§ 34-521—34-533, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an ordinance adopted on Dec. 7, 2005, §§ 34-500—34-508. 

                  Sec. 34-521. - Introduction and overview. 
                  (a)  General purpose. An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to a municipal or county separate storm sewer system (stormwater drainage system) that is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff (except for discharges allowed under an NPDES permit or non-polluting flows). These non-stormwater discharges occur due to illegal dumping or illegal connections to the stormwater drainage system. This article provides the county with the authority to deal with illicit discharges and establishes enforcement actions for those persons or entities found to be in noncompliance or that refuse to allow access to their facilities. 
                  (b)  Overview. It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Discharges to the county separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (2)  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the county separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments; 
                  (3)  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters; 
                  (4)  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (5)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the county separate storm sewer system; 
                  (6)  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system. 
                  (c)  Therefore, Bartow County, Georgia adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the county separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
                  (Ord. of 5-9-2007, § 34-500) 
                  Sec 34-522. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the Bartow County separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the county separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the Bartow County separate storm sewer system by any person; 
                  (2)  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the Bartow County separate storm sewer system; 
                  (3)  Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the Bartow County separate storm sewer system; and, 
                  (4)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
                  (b)  Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the unincorporated area of Bartow County. 
                  (c)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (d)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
                  (e)  Responsibility for administration. The county engineer shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article, by and through its inspections division of the engineering department.

                  Sec. 34-552. - Description. 
                  This article addresses post-development stormwater management requirements for new development and redevelopment in the county. The article defines requirements for a post-development stormwater management plan, which is required in order to undertake land development activities. This plan contains the details of how the development will address post-development stormwater runoff quality and quantity impacts resulting from the permanent alteration of the character and hydrology of the land surface as well as the nonpoint source pollution from land use activities. This article also outlines the water quantity and quality performance criteria for managing this runoff and specifies the county's requirements for the use of structural stormwater controls and nonstructural practices, in order to protect public health and safety, protection of public and private property and infrastructure, and environmental protection. Ongoing long-term inspection and maintenance provisions are provided. The majority of technical criteria and standards are adopted by reference through the use of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM). 
                  (Ord. of 12-7-2005(2), § 9.1.2) 
                  Sec. 34-553. - Introduction. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of the county's watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  (2)  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (3)  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (4)  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  (5)  The county is required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require the county to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
                  (6)  Therefore, the county has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting our local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  (Ord. of 12-7-2005(2), § 9.1.3) 
                  Sec. 34-554. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and, 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  (Ord. of 12-7-2005(2), § 9.8) 
                  Sec. 34-682. - Notice of violation. 
                  (a)  If the department determines that an applicant or other responsible person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, an approved stormwater management plan or the provisions of this article, it may issue a written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person, or may take such other actions as are authorized below. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by this article without having first secured a permit therefore, the notice of violation may be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of the activity being conducted on the site. Persons actually conducting the activity may also be served with a notice of violation. 
                  (b)  The notice of violation shall contain: 
                  (1)  The name and address of the owner or the applicant or the responsible person; 
                  (2)  The address or other description of the site upon which the violation is occurring; and

                  (3)  A requirement for payment of civil fines. 
                  (Ord. of 12-7-2005(2), § 9.8.1) 
                  Sec. 34-683. - Additional enforcement actions; penalties. 
                  In the event the remedial measures described in the notice of violation have not been completed by the date set forth for such completion in the notice of violation, any one or more of the following actions or penalties may be taken or assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation was directed. The following actions may be taken after a notice of violation has been issued, or may be taken without a notice of violation first being issued, as is appropriate in the judgment of the officials of the engineering department to achieve the purposes of this article and protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
                  (1)  Stop-work order. The department may issue a stop-work order which shall be served on the applicant or other responsible person. A stop-work order may be issued after a notice of violation or may be issued in conjunction with a notice of violation. The stop-work order shall remain in effect until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth indicated in the order or notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violation or violations described therein. 
                  a.  Stop-work orders shall affect all work being done on a project or development (including work done on other lots in the subdivision owned by the same violator). Stop-work orders stop not only the work in violation, but all other work by contractors or sub-contractors on the same property. Only work to remedy the deficiency shall be allowed until the stop-work order is lifted. 
                  b.  A stop-work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency or other exigent circumstances exist, no written notice shall be required, and a verbal stop-work order may be issued, with a written order to be provided within three working days. 
                  c.  Stop-work orders may be issued on their own, or in conjunction with criminal citations, or civil proceedings in superior court. 
                  (2)  Withhold building permits or certificate of occupancy. The engineering department may advise the building inspections department to refuse to issue building permits or certificates of occupancy for the buildings or other improvements constructed or being constructed on the site until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein. 
                  (3)  Suspension, revocation or modification of permit. The department may suspend, revoke or modify the permit authorizing the land development project. A suspended, revoked or modified permit may be reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated [upon such conditions as the department may deem necessary] to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations. 
                  (4)  Civil penalties. In the event the applicant or other responsible person fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within ten days, or such shorter or longer period as the department shall deem appropriate depending on the severity of the situation (at a minimum 24 hours unless the situation is a severe emergency), the department may impose a penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. If unpaid, the county may seek enforcement of such penalties in superior or magistrate court. Civil fines may also be sought in actions filed in superior court for injunctive relief, whether or not a notice of violation was issued. 
                  (5)  Criminal penalties. In addition to, or in lieu of, any of the above actions, the department may issue a citation to the applicant or other responsible person, requiring such person to appear in magistrate or superior court to answer charges for such violation. Upon conviction, such person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 or imprisonment for 60 days or both. Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The minimum fine for a violation of this article shall be $500.00. Such fines may be sough in connection with an action for injunctive relief in superior court. All persons involved in the violation, including land owners, developers, responsible parties, and persons actually conducting the activity, may be cited with violations of this article. Citations may be issued in conjunction with notices of violation and/or stop-work orders, but a notice of violation need not be issued prior to issuance of a citation. 
                  (6)  Emergency enforcement. In the event an emergency is of such immediacy and danger that giving a 24 hours' notice of violation would threaten the public health, safety and welfare, the county is authorized to enter upon the subject private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and correct the situation. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. The county shall be authorized to recover costs of the abatement from the property owner or responsible parties. 
                  (7)  Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this article are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and the county may seek cumulative remedies. 
                  In any action brought in magistrate or superior court to enforce this article, the county shall be entitled to recover attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement of this article, including sampling and monitoring expenses. 
                  Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the county by reason of such violation.

It is the purpose of this article to regulate peddling in the county, to protect the public health, safety and welfare. To achieve this end, this article requires peddlers seek licenses, have background checks, and peddle under certain limitations.

Neither is it the intent of this article to infringe free speech rights or require licensing for persons going door-to-door for political campaigns, religious proselytizing, or other free speech reasons.

                  (11)  Violate any criminal law of this state while acting in the course of business as an owner or employee of a regulated business.

                  (d)  Any person properly identifying himself and presenting a pawn ticket to the pawnbroker shall be presumed to be the pledger or seller and shall be entitled to redeem the pledged goods described in such ticket. In the event such pledged goods are lost or damaged while in the possession of the pawnbroker, it shall be the responsibility of the pawnbroker to replace the lost or damaged goods with like kinds of merchandise and proof of replacement shall be a defense to prosecution. For the purposes of this subsection, "lost" includes destroyed or having disappeared because of any cause, whether known or unknown, that results in the pledged goods being unavailable for return to the pledger.

                  (a)  Commencement of prosecution by citation. 
                  (1)  Prosecutions for violation of this article upon citation shall be commenced by the completion, signing, and service of a citation by a deputy sheriff or other authorized officer. The original of the citation shall be personally served upon the accused; a copy shall be promptly filed with the court. 
                  (2)  Each citation shall state the time and place at which the accused is to appear for trial, shall identify the offense with which the accused is charged, shall have an identifying number by which it shall be filed with the court, shall indicate the identity of the accused and the date of service, and shall be signed by a deputy sheriff or other authorized officer who completes and serves it. 
                  (3)  Any defendant who fails to appear for trial shall thereafter be arrested on the warrant of the magistrate and required to post a bond for his or her future appearance. 
                  (4)  The district attorney, county attorney, or another attorney designated by Bartow County may act as prosecuting attorney for violations of this article. 
                  (b)  Cash bonds. 
                  (1)  The chief magistrate shall, by written order, establish the amount of a cash bond for the personal appearance in court of any person charged with a violation of this article. 
                  (2)  The magistrate shall designate the officer or officers authorized to accept cash bonds. 
                  (3)  In no event shall any officer or agent who is authorized to issue citations, be authorized to accept a cash bond at the time of or in conjunction with the issuance of any citation. 
                  (4)  The officer accepting the cash bond shall issue a receipt for the bond of the person charged with a violation. 
                  (5)  Any person who has a case by citation but has not been arrested may, but shall not be required to, give a cash bond for his personal appearance in court for trial. If a person who has given a cash bond fails to appear for trial, failure to appear shall be deemed to constitute a guilty plea and such cash bond shall be forfeited upon the call of the case for trial. It shall not be necessary for the county to take any further action to forfeit the cash bond. Forfeiture of a cash bond shall be deemed to constitute imposition and payment of a fine, and shall be a bar to a subsequent prosecution of the accused for the same violation of this article. The court may, however, in any case enter an order pursuant to which a bond forfeiture shall not be deemed to constitute imposition of a sentence, and subsequent prosecution shall not be barred; and in any such case, the amount of the bond forfeited shall be credited against any fine subsequently imposed. 
                  (6)  It shall be the duty of the clerk of the magistrate court to furnish the officer or officers authorized under the order with a book of blank receipts consecutively numbered in triplicate and readily distinguishable and identifiable. The receipts shall be completed by the officers when accepting a cash bond so as to show the name of the person cited or arrested, the date of citation or arrest, nature of the offense, amount of cash bond given, and the name of the receiving officer. The receiving officer shall deliver a copy of the receipt to the person cited or arrested at the time the cash bond is given, and shall file the original, together with the cash bond, with the clerk of the magistrate court not later than the next succeeding business day following the date of issuance of the receipt.

                  Sec. 50-79. - Punishment. 
                  (a)  Any person who violates this article may be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 or imprisonment for 60 days or both. 
                  (b)  In lieu of, or in addition to, any fine or incarceration, community service may be ordered by the court as punishment for a violation of this article. Said community service shall be not less than 20 hours but not more than 250 hours, which must be performed within one year from the date of conviction for a violation of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person placed on community service or otherwise placed on probation for a violation of this article shall pay such supervisory fees as may be authorized by law. 
                  (d)  In addition to any other fine and fees, the court is hereby authorized to assess a supervision fee in the amount of $100.00.

                  Sec. 50-80. - Executions upon unpaid fines. 
                  (a)  Execution may issue immediately upon any fine imposed by the court and not immediately paid.

                  Sec. 55-23. - Definitions.

                  Encroachments means any building, structure, or vehicle, or other object or thing (including but not limited to mailboxes, signs, cars, gates, walls, sprinkler systems, trees, posts, etc.) which is located in the right-of-way. 
                  Encroach means to be within the right-of-way. 
                  Materially injure means damaging the pavement or right-of-way to the extent that a repair is or will be required by the community development department in order to bring the pavement or right-of-way back to county standards. It shall also mean causing more than $50.00 damage to the right-of-way or pavement, considering the labor cost and materials to repair the injury, whether or not such repair is undertaken by the community development department. 
                  Obstruct, includes without limitation, the causing of any buildup of rock, gravel, mud, dirt, chemicals, or other materials by continued ingress or egress of vehicles or of any natural waters dammed or redirected by diversion to an extent which presents a hazard to the traveling public.

                  Right-of-way means any right-of-way that has been accepted by Bartow County into the county roads, and such term includes the full width of the right-of-way, and not just width of the pavement.

                  (Ord. of 6-6-2007, § 3; Ord. of 9-11-2013, §§ I, II) 
                  Sec. 55-24. - Prohibitions.

                  (d)  The county shall owe no compensation for removal of illegal encroachments or obstructions. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-2007, § 4; Ord. of 9-11-2013, § II) 
                  Sec. 55-25. - Permitted encroachments. 
                  (a)  Driveways. Driveways (including paved, masonry, asphalt, etc.) are permitted to encroach on the right-of-way. A driveway permit shall be required and the lot owner shall secure permission for any new driveway from the community development department. Driveways must meet sight distance requirements of community development department, and must be constructed in compliance with county requirements for stormwater drainage/piping and include a hard, permanent surface (concrete or asphalt). 
                  (b)  Landscaping. Limited landscaping is permitted in the county right-of-way, including grass, flowers and shrubs not in excess of two feet in height. Trees shall not be planted in the right-of-way. Irrigation systems shall not be installed in the right-of-way. 
                  (c)  Mailbox support structures. The county permits limited encroachment of the right-of-way for mailbox support structures, which meet the following standards: 
                  (1)  The use of massive mailbox support structures that, when struck, could damage vehicles and cause serious injury to vehicle occupants are prohibited. Heavy metal posts, concrete posts, brick bases, and miscellaneous items such as farm equipment or supports filled with concrete are also prohibited and cannot be used for mailbox supports. 
                  (2)  Acceptable mailbox supports include: a) a single four-inch by four-inch or four-inch diameter wooden post; b) a metal post with strength no greater than a two-inch diameter standard strength steel hollow pipe; or c) other support of no greater strength, as approved by the road department, as in accordance with the standards of the AASHTO Roadway Design Guidelines for mailbox structures, which are incorporated herein by reference. In the event the property owner has any question as to whether the proposed mailbox support will be permitted, the community development department should be consulted. 
                  (3)  Mailbox supports must be embedded no more than 24 inches into the ground. A metal post shall not be fitted with an anchor plate, but it may have an anti-twist device that extends no more than ten inches below the ground surface. 
                  (4)  Mailboxes. The post-to-box attachment details should be of sufficient strength to prevent the box from separating from the post top if a vehicle strikes the installation. The mailbox itself should be of lightweight steel, wood, or plastic/composite construction, and meeting U.S. Postal Service regulations. 
                  (d)  Driveways. New driveways for single family residences tying into existing Bartow County roads must receive a driveway permit from the community development department prior to constructing a driveway. The applicant shall submit information on a form issued by the community development department regarding the location, proposed size and construction, and other relevant information. New driveways on commercial or industrial or other non-residential developments shall be approved through the permit process for the engineering department. If a new commercial or industrial or other non-residential development is of a type that does not require engineering department approval, the applicant shall still require a driveway permit prior to construction. 
                  (e)  Utility work. The county permits utilities to encroach in the right-of-way subject to the terms of the Bartow County Utility Accommodation Ordinance. Such work shall require issuance of surety to secure performance of the work and a warranty and maintenance period, as stated in that ordinance. 
                  (f)  Projects tying into Bartow County rights-of-way. New developments that tie into existing Bartow County road rights-of-way are permitted, with the permission of the community development department. Approval is given as a part of the approval process through the engineering department under the development regulations. If any new construction or development requires tying into a county road but does not require a land disturbance permit or any development approval from the engineering department, the applicant must submit plans to the community development department prior to beginning construction and secure a permit. In all cases, surety shall be required as stated in subsection (h) below; no work shall be permitted in a Bartow County right-of-way without a surety. 
                  (g)  Permitted improvement of existing Bartow County roads. In certain circumstances, a developer or other party may be permitted or required to improve Bartow County roads. In such circumstances, the plans typically shall be approved through the engineering department and a surety posted in accordance with the development regulations for work in an existing county right-of-way. The amount of the surety shall be sufficient to pay for the project, including associated utility relocations/installations and stormwater controls. In the event the development does not require approval through the engineering department, a permit shall be secured through the community development department. In all cases where work is performed in a Bartow County right-of-way, surety shall be required as stated in subsection (h) below; no work shall be permitted in a Bartow County right-of-way without a surety. 
                  (h)  Surety to county. Prior to issuance of an approval to work in a Bartow County right-of-way, except as otherwise approved under the utility accommodation ordinance, the party seeking to perform the work shall cause to be executed in favor of Bartow County surety in the form of a performance and maintenance bond, an irrevocable standby letter of credit, or an escrow deposit. The surety must be accepted and approved by the community development department before any permit can issue. In the event the work in the right-of-way is related to a development approved through the engineering department, the surety requirements of the Bartow County Development Regulations (which are essentially identical to the requirements below) shall control, and the surety shall be administered by the county engineer. However, if the project is not approved through the engineering department, the surety requirements below shall apply, and the surety shall be administered by the community development department. 
                  (1)  Purpose. The purpose of the surety shall be the following: 1) to ensure proper construction of any work performed in existing Bartow County rights-of-way (whether road improvement, tying into an existing right-of-way or other purpose); 2) to provide a guaranty for the warranty and maintenance period applicable to any work in any existing county right-of-way. 
                  (2)  Approval. The surety shall only be issued in a form approved by Bartow County. The language of the surety and the term of the surety must be approved by Bartow County prior to issuance. Bartow County has forms it prefers that surety companies use, and those can be provided upon request; otherwise, the form of the surety shall be approved by the community development department prior to acceptance of the surety. Any irrevocable standby letter of credit or surety bond shall be issued by a company or financial institution authorized to do business in the State of Georgia. Irrevocable standby letters of credit shall be issued in accordance with the current International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) publications governing such letters of credit, and must be issued by a bank having a physical branch in Bartow County, which shall be the place of tender of the draft on said letter of credit. Bartow County reserves the right to demand a specific form of surety from an applicant that has tendered unsatisfactory surety in the past. Bartow County reserves the right to reject a surety from a financial institution or insurance company that has provided an unsatisfactory surety in the past. Escrow shall mean deposit of good funds in a bank of Bartow County's choosing pursuant to escrow instructions issued by Bartow County. 
                  (3)  Scope. In each case, the surety guarantees that all applicable provisions of any Bartow County Ordinances are complied with, including but not limited to, the Bartow County Development Regulations, the Utility Accommodation Ordinance, Bartow County Standard Road Details, and the regulations promulgated under each of the foregoing. 
                  (4)  Amount and term. The amount of the surety depends on the project, and shall be set by the community development department relying on experience with similar projects and the applicant, knowledge of material and labor costs, and investigation of additional costs. The amount shall be sufficient to secure performance of the work and compliance with the county ordinances and regulations. For work in existing county rights-of-way (whether improving existing roads, tying into existing roads, or other purposes), the amount of surety shall be sufficient to ensure repair the roads after any planned work, including associated utility relocations/installations and stormwater controls, that are part of the project being approved; the minimum amount shall be $25,000.00. The foregoing amount is a minimum and can be increased based on a more complex or expensive project, difficult terrain or other factors that would make the remedial work more expensive. No additional separate amount of surety shall be required for maintenance purposes. The term of any surety shall extend for the period from the issuance of the permit until the project is completed, and additionally beyond that for the duration of the warranty and maintenance period. 
                  (5)  Partial release. Once a project has been inspected and completed, the county may, at the discretion of the community development department, release a portion of the surety amount; the remainder shall be kept as surety for the maintenance period. Once the applicable maintenance period has passed, the remaining surety amount shall be released. 
                  (6)  Prerequisite; calling surety. No permit or approval for work in the right-of-way shall be issued by the community development department until the surety has been furnished to the county, in a form acceptable to the county. If the developer does not comply with these regulations, other applicable Bartow County Ordinances and regulations, or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the county may call the surety, or any part thereof, to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to perform the work or hire a contractor to remedy the defects, whether that means installing soil erosion and sedimentation prevention measures, completing paving and road work, or completing other work. 
                  (7)  Waiver. The community development department shall be authorized, but not required, to reduce or waive the surety requirement for projects undertaken by a municipal government in the county. 
                  (i)  Warranty. Any permit holder working in the right-of-way shall provide a two-year warranty for any work conducted under authority of this article. The two-year warranty shall commence upon the completion of the work. The surety shall remain in effect during the warranty period. During the warranty period, the permit holder shall be responsible to repair any defects in the work or repair, or correct any deficiencies that are not up to the standards and regulations of the county ordinances. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-2007, § 5; Ord. of 9-10-2008, § I; Ord. of 9-11-2013, § I; Ord. of 11-7-2018(2) , § V) 
                  Sec. 55-26. - Non-conforming encroachments. 
                  (a)  All encroachments pre-existing the date of adoption of this article may remain as non-conforming encroachments, unless and until removal is ordered by the community development director, for utility work, road work or other work necessitating access to the right-of-way. For pre-existing encroachments, the county shall give 30 days' notice of removal (unless the encroachment presents a safety hazard). 
                  (b)  Any structure pre-existing the article which is damaged or removed shall not be replaced in kind and must be replaced in accordance with the requirements of the article. 
                  (c)  The county shall owe no compensation for removal of non-conforming encroachments. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-2007, § 6; Ord. of 9-11-2013, § II) 
                  Sec. 55-27. - Administration and enforcement. 
                  (a)  Administration. This article shall be administered by the community development director. The community development director shall have the authority to issue permits for encroachments in the rights-of-way not specified above, and any question if interpretation or administration shall be determined by that official. The appeal of any decision by the community development director shall be to the Commissioner of Bartow County. 
                  (b)  Enforcement powers. The community development director and the county sheriff, as well as county code enforcement officers, and county attorney, are empowered to enforce this article. The foregoing shall be empowered to issue citations, seek other civil relief, or issue stop work orders for violations of this article. Any person, firm, partnership, corporation or other legal entity who shall do anything prohibited by this article as the same exists or as it may hereafter be amended or which shall fail to do anything required by this article as the same exists or as it may hereafter be amended shall be subject to an enforcement action. 
                  (c)  Right of removal. The community development department shall have the authority to remove without notice any encroachment or obstruction of the right-of-way. The community development department shall also have the authority to issue a notice of removal to property owners giving them up to 30 days to remove an unpermitted encroachment. 
                  (d)  Criminal prosecution. The community development director, county sheriff, or designated code enforcement personnel, or other authorized personnel, may issue criminal citations for violations of this article, or violation of any stop-work order. 
                  (1)  Criminal prosecutions for violation of this article shall be commenced by the completion, signing, and service of a citation by an authorized county official. No warning need be issued prior to a citation being issued. The original of the citation shall be personally served upon the accused, his or her authorized representative or, if a corporation, an officer of the corporation or its on-site representative or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and a copy shall be promptly filed with the magistrate court. A stop-work order may be issued in conjunction with a citation. 
                  (2)  Each citation shall state the time and place at which the accused is to appear for trial in magistrate court, shall identify the offense with which the accused is charged, shall have an identifying number by which it shall be filed with the court, shall indicate the identity of the accused and the date of service, and shall be signed by the deputy sheriff or other authorized officer who completes and serves it. 
                  (3)  Any defendant who fails to appear for trial shall thereafter be arrested on the warrant of the magistrate and be required to post a bond for his or her future appearance. 
                  (4)  The district attorney, county attorney, or another attorney designated by Bartow County may act as prosecuting attorney for violations of this article. 
                  (5)  Minimum fines for violations of this article shall be $200.00 for the first violation, and $400.00 for subsequent violations. The maximum permissible fine shall be $1,000.00 per offense. The magistrate court may impose other penalties under its jurisdiction, including up to 60 days incarceration, probation, and restitution or reimbursement costs. 
                  (6)  Daily violations. Each day during which the violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall constitute a separate violation, subjecting the offender to a new citation, or other civil or criminal proceeding. 
                  (e)  Civil fines and proceedings. In addition to or in lieu of any other remedy, the county may seek injunctive, mandamus or other appropriate relief in superior court to enjoin or prevent a violation of any provision of this article. Such action may also seek civil fines at the mandatory rates specified in subsection (d)(6) above for violation of this article, and may additionally seek the costs of restitution, and any other costs associated with the action to enjoin or prevent any violation of any provision of this article. The county shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney's fees and costs for bringing an action in superior court wherein any relief is granted or fine assessed. 
                  (f)  Stop work orders. Upon notice from the community development director, work on any encroachment into the right-of-way that is being done contrary to the provisions of this article, or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his agent, or to the person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, the community development director shall not be required to give a written notice prior to stopping the work, with a written order to be provided within three working days. 
                  (g)  False statements.

The community development director may revoke a permit or approval, issued under the provisions of this article, upon determination by the community development director that the structure or encroachment for which the permit or approval was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of this article. 
                  (i)  Notice of removal. Where the community development director determines that an encroachment must be removed from the right-of-way for construction, maintenance or safety purposes, he may (but is not required to unless otherwise specified herein) issue a notice of removal, giving up to 30 days to remove the structure. After the deadline, the structure may be removed by the county with the costs to be charged to the property owner. The owner may also be cited, fined or have other enforcement action taken against him to secure compliance with this article and/or reimbursement.

                  (1)  Violations. Any timber operator who shall fail to comply with this article as adopted, or as hereafter amended, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, amenable to the process of the superior court of the county or the magistrate court of the county and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of at least $500.00, but not to exceed $1,000.00, as specified herein below or in the relevant section of this article.

                  (4)  Multiple violations. Each day any violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
                  (5)  Citations. Criminal prosecutions for violations of this article, upon citation, shall be commenced by the completion, signing and service of a citation by an authorized employee of the county community development department or other authorized county officer or code enforcement official. The original of the citation shall be personally served upon the accused, his authorized representative or, if a corporation, an officer of the corporation or its on-site representative or the person in charge of the activity on the property; a copy shall be promptly filed with the magistrate court. Each citation shall state the time and place at which the accused is to appear for trial in the magistrate court, shall identify the offense with which the accused is charged, shall have an identifying number by which it shall be filed with the court, shall indicate the identity of the accused and the date of service, and shall be signed by the deputy sheriff or other authorized officer who completes and serves it. 
                  (6)  Road ban order. If there is an ongoing violation of the provisions of this article, an authorized employee of the community development department or other authorized county officer or code enforcement official may issue a stop work order, requiring all use of county roads to cease until such time as the operator comes into compliance with this article. 
                  (b)  Other remedies. 
                  (1)  Civil fines; stop work orders.

                  (2)  Injunctive relief. If any provision of this article is violated, the notice shall cease to be effective. In addition to any other remedies, the county may seek injunctive, mandamus or other appropriate action to prevent or abate such violation in the magistrate or superior court, and the timber operator shall be liable for such court costs and attorney's fees incurred by the county. In addition to or in lieu of any other civil remedy, the county may seek civil fines in the county superior court up to the maximum amounts authorized by this article for any violations.

                  (1)  Violation to contaminate roads. Contamination of public roads with mud, dirt or debris from timber operations is prohibited. The tracking, spilling, dropping, washing, carrying or dumping of any materials, dirt or mud onto any public road in this county, from any vehicle or equipment exiting a timber harvesting tract, or any vehicle having previously exited a timber harvesting tract, shall be a violation of this article. The term "materials" shall include debris from harvested trees, limbs, branches, rock, gravel and other similar material originating at a timber harvesting tract. 
                  (2)  Temporary exit requirements.

Such exit must be established and maintained prior to any timber hauling vehicles or timbering equipment leaving the site, and shall be maintained until the timber hauling operation is completed, and shall meet or exceed the following specifications: 
                  a.  The exit pad shall be adequate to substantially eliminate the transport of mud from the timber site by either vehicles or equipment or from water runoff. 
                  b.  The exit pad of gravel or stone must at least be 20 feet in width by 50 feet in length with a depth of six inches, with a geo-textile pad underneath. The pad may be required to be an additional width, length and/or depth if, in the opinion of the community development department, conditions so warrant. 
                  c.  At such exit location there shall be established a cleaning station, water pump station or some other such means to rinse or clean the exiting vehicle of sediment and debris prior to its entrance onto the public right-of-way. 
                  (3)  Contamination of rights-of-way. No timber operator shall allow dirt, mud or other debris resulting from timber operations to accumulate upon the right-of-way of any public road to such an extent that it becomes a nuisance or hazard to persons traveling upon such roads, or that it creates an unsightly condition upon the public right-of-way. 
                  (4)  Interference with drainage. No timber operator shall allow dirt, mud or other debris resulting from timber operations to accumulate in ditches and drainage areas on public rights-of-way to such an extent that the usual flow of water or runoff is stopped, disturbed, changed or interrupted. 
                  (5)  Cleanup and reimbursement. Any materials or mud spilled, dropped, washed or tracked from vehicles or equipment leaving the site onto roadways or into public rights-of-way, drainage ditches or storm drains must be removed within 24 hours or the county may perform any necessary corrective work and the timber operator shall reimburse the county for any expenses incurred from the required bond or letter of credit. Any such contamination and spillage, even if cleaned up within 24 hours, constitutes a violation of this article. 
                  (6)  Fines. In addition to any cleanup costs that shall be reimbursed to the county, any timber operator failing to comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, or failing to clean up or remove any debris, dirt, mud or other material from any public road, right-of-way or drainage ditch, within 24 hours of the spill or contamination, shall be fined $500.00 upon the first citation, and $1,000.00 upon each subsequent citation. 
                  (b)  Additional requirements.

                  (3)  Soil erosion and sedimentation controls required. No timber operator will commence operation or continue to operate without first installing and maintaining soil erosion and sedimentation controls, in accordance with the best management practices of the Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia, sufficient to prevent dirt, mud or other debris from accumulating in bodies of water within the county, the county drainage ditches and on the county roads upon which the timber operator is entering and exiting. 
                  (4)  Signs. No timber operator shall commence timber operations until he has first posted or caused to be posted along the public road onto which the timber operator will enter from his timber operations at least the following signs: one sign in each direction located 500 feet from the entrance which states "Slow Trucks Entering Highway"; and one sign in each direction located 1,000 feet from the entrance stating "Warning: Logging Operation Ahead." Each such sign shall be 36 inches by 36 inches, orange in color and posted at least three feet from the road surface of such road. 
                  (5)  Reimbursement for abatement of nuisance. In addition to any other penalty provided for under the provisions of this article, or under the provisions of any state or federal law, any timber operator in violation of this section shall reimburse the county for any costs and expenses incurred in abating such nuisance. 
                  (6)  Pre-timber operation meeting. Prior to the notice becoming effective and prior to any timber operations commencing, and onsite meeting with the timber operator will be required with a representative of the community development department. The purpose of the meeting will be to verify installation of required signage (see subsection 68-6(b)(4)) and the temporary construction exit (see subsection 68-6(b)(2)) and to post a county issued timber operations permit card to allow operations to commence.

                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted May 4, 2006, §§ I—VI, deleted in effect the former Div. 2, §§ 54-371—54-373, and enacted a new Art. 2 as set out herein. The former Div. 2 was entitled "Rights-of-Way" and derived from Ord. No. 01-2, §§ I—III, adopted Dec. 4, 2002. 

                  Sec. 72-31. - Utility accommodations in rights-of-way. 
                  (a)  1988 DOT Utility Manual adopted by reference. The 1988 Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards manual, including all references contained therein to codes, rules, regulations, schedules, forms and appendix items, except Appendix B (Permit Forms and Supporting Documents), promulgated by the State of Georgia Department of Transportation, as may be amended from time to time, is adopted by reference and incorporated herein as if fully set forth herein, subject to all amendments and modifications contained in this article. A copy of the manual shall be maintained at the offices of the Bartow County Road Department and the clerk of the commissioner and open for public inspection. The manual and this article shall govern all utility work in Bartow County rights-of-way, and all utility work shall comply with same. 
                  (b)  Amendments. The 1988 Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards manual promulgated by the State of Georgia Department of Transportation, as may be amended from time to time, adopted in subsection (a) above is amended in order to equate state definitions and provisions with their appropriate and equivalent county counterparts, such that a policy shall be implemented to reflect the intent and effect of the state right-of-way policy as it would logically apply to unincorporated Bartow County's rights-of-way. Therefore, the following terms as used in the DOT manual shall be replaced as follows: 
                  (1)  Commissioner means the department director, Bartow County Community Development Department.

                  (10)  Telephone booth shall include any booth or structure, to be used by the public at large, which houses a communications link for local or long distance communications, including but not limited to data communication ports, terminals, kiosks, structures or jacks for connection with local or long distance communications. 
                  (11)  Utility (as defined in the state's policy) shall read: All privately, publicly or cooperatively owned systems for producing, transmitting or distributing communication, data, information, telecommunication, cable television, power, electricity, light, heat, gas, oil, crude products, water/sewer, steam, fire and police signals, traffic control devices, and street lighting systems, and housing or conduit for any of the foregoing, which directly or indirectly serve the public or any part thereof. The term "utility" may also be used to refer to the owner, operator, provider, servicer, or any agent thereof, of any above-described utility or utility facility. 
                  (Ord. of 5-4-2006; Ord. of 9-11-2013, §§ I, II) 
                  Sec. 72-32. - Utility locations in rights-of-way; standards; repair standards. 
                  All utilities locating their facilities in new residential and commercial developments shall locate their facilities pursuant to the Bartow County Development Regulations, and the Bartow County Development Standards and Specifications, and as those may be amended from time to time. All work authorized by any permit issued under this article shall be in accordance with all applicable Bartow County specifications and requirements. All utility work in Bartow County right-of-ways shall comply with the provisions of this article. In the event that the development regulations or development standards conflict with the Georgia Department of Transportation's Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards, Bartow County's ordinances will prevail, so long as they are not preempted by state law. Repair work shall be completed in accordance to Bartow County Community Development Department specifications, which shall be provided by the department at the time the permit is issued. 
                  (Ord. of 5-4-2006; Ord. of 9-11-2013, § I) 
                  Sec. 72-33. - Utility permits, written notification, and exempt activities. 
                  (a)  Permits; notification. Any work in a Bartow County right-of-way shall either require a utility permit, written notification in advance of the work, or shall be exempt, as specified below. Only the utility itself can obtain a permit, and the contractor(s) intended to do the work must be identified on the permit. Work in a Bartow County right-of-way without a permit, for any type of work for which a permit is required, shall be a violation of this article. Utility permits provide notice and approval for major projects, new installations, and other similar matters, and should be applied for at least two weeks before the work is scheduled to begin. Written notification provides notice for minor matters and certain repairs. Written notification must be submitted, and acknowledgment of the notice received, prior to any work beginning that requires notification, as specified below. Proceeding on work that requires a written notification, before notification is submitted, or before acknowledgment of the notice is returned, shall be a violation of this article. Exempt activities, as specified below, require neither a utility permit nor written notification. 
                  (b)  Procedures. The department has written procedures for applying for a utility permit, and for providing written notification. Such procedures are incorporated herein by reference, and are available from the department, along with necessary forms. The department may require such information as it deems necessary prior to issuance of a utility permit. 
                  (c)  Utility permits. Utility permits shall be required in the following situations: 
                  (1)  Installation of new utilities, for new commercial, residential or industrial developments, projects or subdivisions. 
                  (2)  Work involving underground burial of utilities and overhead work, unless specifically covered under written notification procedures or exempted below. 
                  (3)  Any new utility pole installation; replacements are covered by written notification, and emergency replacements are exempt (see emergency repair regulations). 
                  (4)  Utility tie-ins that require cutting any roadway more than half of the width. 
                  (5)  Linear projects involving multiple service connections or roadway crossings that are not perpendicular. 
                  (d)  Written notification. Written notification must be submitted, and acknowledgment of the notice received back from the department, prior to any work beginning that requires written notification, as specified below. If a situation arguably falls under both the written notification and the utility permit procedures, the utility permit procedures shall be used, unless otherwise determined by the department. Written notification shall be required in the following situations: 
                  (1)  Maintenance, inspection, and/or testing of utilities (including replacement of parts necessary due to damage, deterioration or obsolescence) that would: 
                  a.  Require blocking of more than one travel lane; 
                  b.  Require the blocking of one travel lane for a period of longer than two hours in a 24-hour period; or 
                  c.  Require cutting, trenching or boring in or under the roadbed. 
                  (2)  Installation of lateral service connections to serve occupants of adjacent property, if such connections:

                  c.  Require the blocking of one travel lane for a period of longer than two hours in a 24-hour period; or 
                  d.  Require cutting, trenching or boring in or under the roadbed. 
                  (3)  Installation of additional appurtenances or attachments to facilities which: 
                  a.  Affect vertical or horizontal clearances from the traveled way; 
                  b.  Change the rated capacity or transmittance of the facility for which a permit was issued; 
                  c.  Require blocking of more than one travel lane;

                  (10)  Boring, punching and directional drilling for service tie-in that is not a linear project and instead results in a perpendicular crossing of the roadway (an eight by 11-inch sketch drawing of any boring, punch or directional drilling to ascertain its location will be required); linear projects or crossings that are not perpendicular require utility permits. 
                  (e)  Exempt activities. The following activities shall not require a utility permit or written notification, provided they do not also include any activity specifically listed as requiring a utility permit or written notification: 
                  (1)  Routine or periodic maintenance, inspection, and/or testing of utilities (including replacement of parts necessary due to damage, deterioration or obsolescence) that would not:

                  (3)  Installation of additional appurtenances or attachments to facilities that would not: 
                  a.  Affect vertical or horizontal clearances from the traveled way; 
                  b.  Change the rated capacity or transmittance of the facility for which a permit was issued; 
                  c.  Require blocking of more than one travel lane;

                  (f)  Emergency repairs. Emergency repairs do not require the giving of written notification before the repair is conducted, but repairs that would otherwise require written notification (i.e., would not be exempt repairs anyway) must provide post-repair written notification as soon as possible, no later than the end of the next business day. The sole exception is repairs that would only require notification due to blockage of a lane for more than two hours, or blockage of more than one lane; post-repair notification is not required for such repairs. However, post-repair notification is required for: repairs that require mechanical excavation; repairs that require boring, cutting or trenching the roadway; repairs that affect vertical clearances; repairs that install replacement poles; and so forth. An emergency repair is defined as an emergency replacement of poles, wires, or other facilities damaged by accidents or natural causes such as wind or ice and when immediate repair is required to repair service, or in cases where there is an imminent threat to public health or safety. In the event of an emergency repair requiring the blockage of one or more travel lanes, E-911 should be notified as soon as possible by telephone. 
                  (Ord. of 5-4-2006; Ord. of 9-11-2013, § I) 
                  Sec. 72-34. - Provisions for the protection of the public. 
                  (a)  Safety procedures; securing work site. The use of the right-of-way shall be minimized to the greatest possible extent. No materials or equipment shall be stored on the right-of-way without prior written approval. No work shall restrict the sight distances for motorist exiting adjacent streets or driveways unless a flagman is provided. Minimum distances of lane closures to protect the safety of the work crews and the general public shall be provided by the Bartow County Community Development Department. Closure of lanes and traffic flow, and other relevant safety measures, shall be conducted in accordance with the current edition of the Uniform Manual on Traffic Control Devices, latest edition, as well as the DOT Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards manual, latest edition. Debris shall not be placed on the right-of-way, but will be hauled away as the excavation occurs. All trenches opened each day must be backfilled and compacted to 95 percent standard proctor using appropriate tamping or vibratory equipment unless otherwise approved by the department. The department reserves the right to require compaction testing from the utility, at the utility's expense, for any work involving cutting, trenching, or backfilling in the roadbed. Any postings must be properly posted and maintained so they are legible. All work areas must be secured at the end of each workday to protect the general public. Cover plates for gaps in the roadway must be secured at the end of each workday. Plates must be secured so that there is no possibility that the plates can move or shift due to traffic flow. No open cuts shall be allowed after work has stopped. 
                  (b)  Indemnification. The utility receiving the permit and the contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless Bartow County, the department and all county employees, and agents, from any and all liability resulting from any work performed under the permit or with written notification in a county right-of-way, as provided in the current edition of the state D.O.T.'s Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards. The utility shall also indemnify the county from any claims, suits or causes of action resulting from any work under the permit or pursuant to written notification. These terms shall become terms of and contained within the permit/permit application and/or special assurances form(s). Such indemnification shall include the costs of attorneys' fees and litigation expenses to enforce this indemnification provision. 
                  (c)  Warranty. The utility shall provide a one-year warranty for any work conducted under authority of this article including any new installation and any repair work. The one-year warranty shall commence upon the completion of the work. The warranty shall be supported by a surety in the case of a utility permit, or by the utility owner in the case of actions requiring written notification. The utility shall be responsible to repair any defects in the work or repair, or correct any deficiencies that are not up to the standards and regulations of the county ordinances. 
                  (d)  Surety. Surety shall be required for work under this article, as specified herein, to ensure performance of the repair in compliance with the standards and regulations of the county and specifically to ensure that roads are repaired properly. Surety shall be in the nature of a performance and maintenance bond, an irrevocable standby letter of credit, or an escrow deposit. 
                  (1)  Form. The surety shall only be issued in a form approved by Bartow County. The language of the surety and the term of the surety must be approved by Bartow County prior to issuance. Bartow County has forms it prefers that surety companies use, and those can be provided upon request; otherwise, the form of the surety shall be approved by the county prior to acceptance of the surety. Any irrevocable standby letter of credit or surety bond shall be issued by a company or financial institution authorized to do business in the State of Georgia. Irrevocable standby letters of credit shall be issued in accordance with the current International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) publications governing such letters of credit, and must be issued by a bank having a physical branch in Bartow County, which shall be the place of tender of the draft on said letter of credit. Bartow County reserves the right to demand a specific form of surety from a developer that has tendered unsatisfactory surety in the past. Bartow County reserves the right to reject a surety from a financial institution or insurance company that has provided an unsatisfactory surety in the past. Escrow shall mean deposit of good funds in a bank of Bartow County's choosing pursuant to escrow instructions issued by Bartow County. 
                  (2)  Amount. Surety shall be in an amount determined by the community development department based on the size of the project. The minimum surety for a utility permit shall be $25,000.00. The department may use its discretion when setting the amount of the bond and should consider potential damage to public property or facilities and the relationship to the cost of installation, as well as the factors used in determining whether a project is complex. 
                  (3)  Prerequisite; calling surety. No permit shall be issued by the community development department until the surety has been furnished to the county, in a form acceptable to the county. If the developer does not comply with these regulations, other applicable Bartow County Ordinances and regulations, or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the county may call the surety, or any part thereof, to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to perform the work or hire a contractor to remedy the defects, whether that means installing soil erosion and sedimentation prevention measures, completing paving and road work, or completing other work. 
                  (4)  Waiver. The community development department shall be authorized, but not required, to reduce or waive the surety requirement for projects undertaken by a municipal government in the county. The surety requirement may also be waived by the department head's discretion, for utilities that have demonstrated a history of compliance with this article, financial responsibility, quality work, and prompt responsiveness. 
                  (e)  Insurance. All utilities operating in county right-of-ways shall also provide proof of liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.00 in general liability coverage that shall also cover the actions of the contracts and subcontractors. In lieu of the foregoing, the utility may self-insure for the above-referenced coverages. The utility shall present valid proof of self-insurance upon the department's request. The utility shall also require equivalent insurance from their contractors or subcontractors. 
                  (Ord. of 5-4-2006; Ord. of 9-10-2008, § I; Ord. of 9-11-2013, § I) 
                  Sec. 72-35. - Administration and enforcement. 
                  (a)  Administration. The community development director shall have the authority to administer the state department of transportation's Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards, as amended from time to time by the state or county, on county roads in unincorporated Bartow County and in accordance with any procedures the Bartow County Community Development Department may establish thereunder. 
                  (b)  Fees. The Commissioner of Bartow County shall be authorized to charge fees in accordance with the state department of transportation's Utility Accommodations Policy and Standards and any other applicable laws that exist now or may be enacted in the future. Fees shall be determined by the community development director and approved by the Commissioner of Bartow County. Any fee schedule shall be posted at the offices of the community development department and open for public inspection. Fees may be waived for work conducted on behalf of municipal or governmental utilities, only for work being performed by the municipalities' or governments' own employees. For work being performed for a municipality or government by a contractor, normal fees shall be charged. 
                  (c)  Responsible party. Only the utility itself can obtain a permit. The permit shall identify the contractor responsible for the repair and any subcontractors. The utility and any and all contractors or subcontractors shall be held liable for any violations of this article. The permit shall be posted at the site at all times, and a copy of the permit shall also be kept available at all times on the job site when any work is underway. 
                  (d)  Inspection. The department reserves the right to inspect the work during such periods as the department's field inspector(s) deem necessary to check compliance with the terms of the permit, and to require the utility and/or contractor to correct all deviations from the approved permit, or any safety concerns the inspector may have. If the utility and/or contractor do not correct the deviations, the permit can be revoked and a violation cited. 
                  (e)  Notice of defect. If a utility installation or road repair is found by the Bartow County Community Development Department not to be in compliance with the specifications provided, or otherwise not in compliance with this article or the permit, the community development department shall notify the utility immediately by written notice of defect. The utility will then have 48 hours to make the necessary repairs or other work, unless longer time is granted by the department. If the necessary work is not completed within the time limit specified, then the county road department may make the repairs or conduct the necessary work, and charge the utility for the costs of the materials and labor. The utility will also be in violation of this article for failing to abide by the notice of defect. The department in such circumstances would be authorized to issue citations, stop-work orders, or seek other relief. See section 54-374. In the case of emergencies, the department shall give the utility 24-hour contact one hour to respond, and if no action is begun to correct the emergency, shall be authorized to repair the deficiency itself. In such cases, the utility shall be responsible for the costs of labor and materials for the emergency repair. In the event Bartow County incurs costs to correct a defect of a utility company, the county shall be authorized to withhold all further permits (or issue a stop-work order) until the costs incurred by the county are paid. 
                  (f)  Violations and penalties. Violations of this article, or the procedures adopted under this article, shall subject the responsible parties to citation in magistrate court. Action may also be taken in superior court to recover fines and also to obtain injunctive relief to cure defects, or for other necessary action. The county attorney or other designated attorney for the department may initiate such actions. Citations shall be served personally on any responsible party at the site of the utility work, and shall be served on the utility through its designated contact in the county, as indicated on the permit. Each day a violation exists shall be a separate violation. 
                  (1)  Responsible parties. Any violation of this article shall subject all involved parties to citation, including the utility holding the permit, the contractor identified on the permit and any subcontractor or individual actually performing the work. Any or all of the responsible parties may be cited with a violation. 
                  (2)  Minimum fines. Minimum fines for violations of this article shall be imposed as follows. For subsequent violations within a one-year period, the minimum fine shall increase as shown below. Fines shall be based on a "rolling" one-year period, as follows: 
                  a.  First violation—$500.00 fine. 
                  b.  Second violation—$750.00 fine. 
                  c.  Third violation—$1,000.00 fine. 
                  d.  The one-year period begins the day of the first violation, so that one year after the day of the first violation, it expires and is no longer counted. 
                  (g)  Stop-work orders. The department is authorized to issue stop-work orders in the event of a violation of this article. In the case of a threat to the public health, safety or welfare, or other harm to the county's property, such orders may be issued without prior issuance of a notice of defect. In the case of other violations, a notice of defect shall be issued first, and a stop-work order may be issued if the necessary repair or work is not completed by the time limit specified. Stop-work orders shall be issued in writing to any responsible party at the site of the utility work, and shall be served on the utility through its designated contact in the county, as indicated on the permit. Such stop-work orders may be issued only to stop-work at the particular location, or may be broadened to halt all work by that same utility in the county. The stop-work order shall state the reason for the issuance and the work that needs to be performed to remedy the situation. 
                  (h)  Appeals. Appeals of determinations and interpretations of the department may be taken to the county commissioner by filing a written notice of appeal within 15 days of the department's decision.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 74-1. - Reserved. 
                  Sec. 74-2. - Fire hydrant testing, maintenance and identification. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to provide a standard system for hydrant color identification and establish a practice of maintenance for fire hydrants within the service area of the Bartow County Fire Department. These provisions shall incorporate by reference the American Water Works Association (AWWA) manual M17, "Installation, Field Testing, and Maintenance of Fire Hydrants"; the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 291 latest edition, defining Fire Flow Testing and Marking Hydrants; and Insurance Service Organization (ISO) standards for fire hydrant testing, collectively referred to herein as the "Standards." 
                  (b)  Testing required. All fire hydrants within the service area of the Bartow County Fire Department shall be flowed and tested in accordance with the Standards. The testing shall determine the gallons per minute (GPM) fire flow for that hydrant. Testing shall be coordinated with the water system that operates the system upon which the hydrant is located. Proper public notice shall be issued in advance of any testing to ensure the public is aware of potential water discoloration. 
                  (c)  Color coding. After testing, each hydrant shall then be color coded in accordance with NFPA 291, as follows: 
                  Standard Hydrants 

                   
                  Disclaimer: Color coding is only descriptive of what GPM flow was at the time of the last documented test. It in no way guarantees that the hydrant will flow that GPM at the time of an incident and does not take into account any high demands, broken mains, closed valves or other events that could affect GPM flow. Color coding is only used as a general reference to what the potential flow may be at any given time and citizens and staff should be aware and prepared for GPM changes. 
                  Special Hydrants: 

                   
                  (d)  Maintenance procedures. An annual maintenance schedule and visual check program shall be established by the Bartow County Fire Department. Personnel and citizen safety shall be a high priority. All fire hydrants are to be opened and closed very slowly to prevent water hammer, line damage and equipment failure. 
                  (e)  Recording data. All test data shall be maintained in the Bartow County Fire Department records as well as the records of the relevant water system owning the hydrant. A record of malfunctions, corrections and system changes shall be recorded. Any malfunction of the system, while performing work on the system, is to be immediately reported to the battalion chief, who will in turn notify appropriate water system officials.

                  Sec. 74-33. - Interference with county property prohibited. 
                  (a)  All persons are prohibited from interfering with or disturbing in any manner or form, any water meters, switches, locks, cutoffs, corporation cocks or other appliances of the county, or to appropriate or use any water after service has been cut off or discontinued for the nonpayment of the charges therefore or for other cause. The head of household or property owner involved shall be held responsible for the violation of this section, in addition to any person observed tampering. Tampering fees of up to $500.00 shall be assessed where a meter has been disturbed, plus the fee for water used. The county reserves the right to remove a service where a meter has been tampered with and to refuse continued service to a property that has a history of violations of water service polices or ordinances. 
                  (b)  Unauthorized operation of a county-owned hydrant will result in a tampering fee of up to $500.00, plus the fee for water used. 
                  (c)  A customer's water meter may be turned off and tagged for any violation of Bartow County Water Department Rules and Regulations or Standard Operating Polices and Procedures, which are incorporated herein by reference. 
                  (1)  If the tag is tampered with then a padlock will be applied and the customer must pay a $50.00-tampering fee before service can be restored. For each subsequent tampering with any tag by the same customer (whether on the same or different property), the fee shall double, to a maximum of $400.00 for the fourth and subsequent tag tampering violation. 
                  (2)  If the padlock is removed or other means are used to gain water service, then the customer shall pay a $100.00 tampering fee plus the cost of any damage to the lock, meter or meter setter. The meter will be removed until all monies due are paid, including any overdue bills. For each subsequent tampering with any padlock by the same customer (whether on the same or different property), the fee shall double, to a maximum of $800.00 for the fourth and subsequent lock tampering violation. 
                  (3)  If, after removal of the meter, an alternative means of obtaining water service is attempted (such as a "jumper" or other means), then the water service will be removed and future service will be considered as if the tampered service never existed. The property owner shall have to apply for and pay for new service, which may or may not be granted, and shall have to pay a fee of $1,000.00 prior to new service being granted. 
                  (d)  The county reserves the right to refuse to provide service to any property that may not be in the best interest of the system, including property with a history of tampering with the meter (or other portions of the system). However, the county shall not refuse to supply water to any single or multifamily residential property to which water has been furnished through the use of a separate water meter for each residential unit on application of the owner or new resident tenant of the premises based solely on the indebtedness of a prior owner, prior occupant, or prior lessee for water previously furnished to such premises. 
                  (e)  The county reserves the right to refuse to provide service to any individual or business customer that may not be in the best interest of the system, including customers with a history of tampering with the meter (or other portions of the system) on any property; customers with a history of non-payment of bills to the water department on any account on any property; or customers having any unpaid bill on any former water department account on the same or different property.

                  (a)  Title to all waterline extensions shall vest in the county upon completion. 
                  (b)  The county shall reserve the right to refuse any extension of water service, or prescribe any additional conditions, if in its judgment the proposed extension would not promote the orderly, harmonious and efficient growth and development of the county and the urban area. 
                  (c)  The county shall reserve the right to refuse any extension of water service to any customer with outstanding balances due or outstanding fines due.

                  Sec. 74-56. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 8-2-1 through 8-2-3 is to impose water conservation restrictions; to provide definitions; to provide exemptions; to provide for penalties; to provide for related matters; to repeal any conflicting ordinances, and for other purposes.

                  Sec. 74-57. - Application. 
                  The requirements of subsection 74-58(a) below shall apply to any residential construction initiated after January 1, 2003 and to any commercial construction initiated after January 1, 2003, which involves the repair or renovation of or addition to any existing building when such repair or renovation of or addition to such existing building includes replacement of toilet or showers or both. 
                  (Ord. of 12-17-2003(1), § 10) 
                  Sec. 74-58. - Restrictions. 
                  (a)  Construction restrictions. On or after January 1, 2003 no construction may be initiated within the county for any residential building of any type which: 
                  (1)  Employs a gravity tank-type, flushometer-valve, or flushometer-tank toilet that uses more than an average of 1.6 gallons of water per flush; 
                  (2)  Employs a showerhead that allows a flow of more than an average of 2.5 gallons of water per minute at 60 pounds per square inch of pressure; 
                  (3)  Employs a urinal that uses more than an average of one gallon of water per flush; 
                  (4)  Employs a lavatory faucet or lavatory replacement aerator that allows a flow of more than 2.2 gallons of water per minute; or 
                  (5)  Employs a kitchen faucet or kitchen replacement aerator that allows a flow of more than 2.2 gallons of water per minute. 
                  (b)  Irrigation systems. All new irrigation systems, both residential and nonresidential, shall have installed a rain sensor irrigation shut-off switch to prevent operation of the system during or within six hours after an adequate rain event. "Adequate rain event" shall mean at least one-half inch of rainfall. 
                  (c)  Conservation. The county water and sewer department superintendent, with the concurrence of the commissioner, is authorized to implement special water conservation measures, on a case-by-case basis, during times of drought, low stream flows, interruptions in the raw water supply due to breaks or contamination; inability of the filter plants to meet demand; excessive losses or demands in the distribution system due to breaks, fires or other causes; restrictions imposed by suppliers or the state, contamination in the finished water; or any other purpose for which the curtailed use of water might be reasonably required in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare as determined by the commissioner. The water conservation measures may include restrictions or prohibitions on nonessential uses such as swimming pool filling; watering of lawns and gardens; washing of motor vehicles; recreational uses; and other uses which the superintendent may deem to be nonessential. The type, nature, degree, commencement and duration of restrictions or prohibitions shall be determined by the superintendent, with the concurrence of the commissioner. Notice of the restrictions or prohibitions shall be publicized in such a manner as to provide adequate notice to the water customer, including but not limited to inclusion on the customer's water bill. The violation of the restriction or prohibition shall be punished as recommended by the superintendent and approved by the commissioner. 
                  (d)  Water conservation surcharge. Effective beginning November 1, 2007, to be reflected in the bills starting with the December 2007 billing cycle, a revised water conservation surcharge will be imposed to increase the rate on higher water usage. This conservation rate structure is required by the State of Georgia to encourage water conservation due to the severe water supply crisis. The charges for the water conservation surcharge are established as multiples of the Base Rate contained in the Bartow County Water and Sewer Rate Structure and Readiness to Serve Ordinance, 2005, as adopted December 7, 2005, and amended December 6, 2006. Tiers are in 1,000 gallon increments as billing is based on that increment. 
                  Conservation Surcharge Water and Wastewater Rates  (by meter type and water volume) 

                   
                  (e)  Emergency conservation measures. During any period when a state of emergency is declared by the governor or the commissioner regarding drought in the county, the county shall be subject to EPD Level 4 drought restrictions on outdoor watering, meaning no outdoor water use is permitted except under the exemptions of the Rules of the EPD, Chapter 391-3-30-.05. Pursuant to the authority of the Rules of the EPD, Chapter 391-3-30-.06, the following additional restrictions on outdoor watering use apply during any period when a state of emergency is declared: 
                  (1)  Landscaping. New landscaping may only be watered for 15 days following installation. This exemption shall only apply to landscape installations performed by licensed landscapers. Homeowners and landscapers may water new landscape installations between the hours of midnight and 10:00 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Only newly installed vegetation may be watered. New home construction will have 15 days to water newly installed landscape, for the purposes of erosion and sedimentation control. A builder may choose to heavily mulch a property instead until water conditions improve. Only one new landscape exemption will be permitted per planting season as defined as September to March and April to August, per property. A new landscape exemption form with a receipt must be submitted to the water department to receive the exemption. Aeration and overseeding shall count as a new exemption. 
                  (2)  Pressure washing. Pressure washing of parking lots is prohibited. Pressure washing of buildings and structures for beautification is prohibited. Pressure washing will be allowed for health and safety reasons. Pressure washing will be allowed when required prior to a procedure such as painting. 
                  (3)  Fire hydrant meters. Use of portable meters associated with fire hydrants shall not be permitted, and any currently in use shall be returned and such use discontinued, except for meters required for public health and/or safety. 
                  (4)  Emergency contracts. For public works construction contracts related to expansion or improvement of the water system that directly result from a drought-related state of emergency (including, but not limited to, contracts to connect to or develop new water supply sources), the commissioner has determined that the best interests of the county necessitate suspending the requirements contained in O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20 for four weeks of advertisement for soliciting bids on such contracts. In the event the water supply situation reaches a critical stage, necessitating the extraordinary expense of an additional connection, a further four-week delay would endanger the public safety and welfare. Similarly, proceeding with an expensive expansion project prior to the absolute latest possible time risks wasting funds on an unnecessary connection. Furthermore, the suspension of such requirements is authorized in O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22. One day of advertisement of such contracts prior to opening bids shall be sufficient, for emergency projects related to expansion or improvement of the water system to cope with the drought. However, the contracts shall be subject to all other provisions of the Public Works Construction Law, except as necessitated by this change. Furthermore, the county shall wait to receive at least three bids on any proposed contract before opening bids (except in circumstances where, after one week, three bids are not received, due to lack of interest from contractors; or except in other dire emergency circumstances necessitating immediate action). 
                  (f)  Restriction on outdoor watering of landscape. Other than in times of a state of emergency (discussed in subsection (e) above), outdoor watering for purposes of planting, growing, managing or maintaining ground cover, trees, shrubs, or other plants in the unincorporated area of the county may only occur between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m.; provided; however, that this limitation shall not create any limitation upon the following outdoor water uses (as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-5-7): 
                  (1)  Commercial agricultural operations (as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3); 
                  (2)  Capture and reuse of cooling system condensate or stormwater in compliance with local ordinances and state guidelines; 
                  (3)  Reuse of gray water in compliance with O.C.G.A. § 31-3-5.2 and local board of health regulations adopted pursuant thereto; 
                  (4)  Use of reclaimed waste water by a designated user from a system permitted by the Environmental Protection Division of the DNR to provide reclaimed waste water; 
                  (5)  Irrigation of personal food gardens; 
                  (6)  Irrigation of new and replanted plant, seed, or turf in landscapes, golf courses, or sports turf fields during installation and for a period of 30 days immediately following the date of installation; 
                  (7)  Drip irrigation or irrigation using soaker hoses; 
                  (8)  Handwatering with a hose with automatic cutoff or handheld container; 
                  (9)  Use of water withdrawn from private water wells or surface water by an owner or operator of property if such well or surface water is on said property; 
                  (10)  Irrigation of horticultural crops held for sale, resale, or installation; 
                  (11)  Irrigation of athletic fields, golf courses, or public turf grass recreational areas; 
                  (12)  Installation, maintenance, or calibration of irrigation systems; or 
                  (13)  Hydroseeding. 
                  (g)  Service leaks. Water leakage creates a serious waste of water. The county water system will leave a door hanger at any address where a leak is detected. Language will be added to let customers know that a leak must be repaired within 24 hours or water service may be terminated. For any leak exceeding 1.0 gallons per minute water service will be immediately terminated until the leak is repaired, and satisfactory evidence of the repair is presented to the water department.

The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 74-352, 74-372, and 74-373 of this article. 
                  (b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d), 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the superintendent, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  (d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  (e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

                  (a)  Except as indicated in subsection (b) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
                  (b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

                  The superintendent, and other authorized representatives of state and federal regulatory agencies, shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the superintendent ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. The superintendent shall also have the right to enter all private properties through which the county holds a utility easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the wastewater facilities lying within such easement. All entry and subsequent work on such easement shall be done in full accord with the terms of the utility easement pertaining to such property. 
                  (1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
                  (2)  The superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
                  (3)  The superintendent may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated as needed to ensure accuracy. 
                  (4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
                  (5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the superintendent access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article.

                  Sec. 74-438. - Notification of violation. 
                  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within seven days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof to include specific required actions shall be submitted by the user to the superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.

                  Sec. 74-439. - Consent orders. 
                  The county may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance with a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 74-440 and 74-441 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.

If the superintendent chooses to have such a hearing, notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 30 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, device or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established or pretreatment standard or requirement, not does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  (1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
                  (2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
                  (b)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  (a)  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per day. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
                  (b)  Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 15 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of 15 percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one and one-half percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties but only in circumstances where the sewer user (or account holder) is the owner of the property. 
                  (c)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
                  (d)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.

                  (a)  The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
                  (1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings under this section are initiated against the users. 
                  (2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrences to the superintendent prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under section 74-439 and this section of this article.

                  (4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or 
                  (5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in this article. 
                  (b)  Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 74-440 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken.

The county may also enter upon property and terminate service when an account is overdue, without further notice. 
                  (b)  In the event of such termination under this section, the county shall retain all rights to collect unpaid bills or amounts owed by the terminated user according to law or other provisions of this article. Unpaid charges for a terminated service may be sought from the account holder and imposed on any other account the account holder has with Bartow County, or may be imposed if the account holder ever seeks to reestablish water or sewer service with Bartow County. 
                  (c)  Past due amounts shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month. 
                  (d)  Past due amounts shall constitute a lien upon the premises served, but only in circumstances where the sewer user (or account holder) is the owner of the property.

                  The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the county's enforcement response plan. However, the superintendent may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant; further, the superintendent is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

                  Sec. 74-501. - Upset. 
                  (a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) below are met. 
                  (c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  (1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
                  (2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with operation and maintenance procedures; and 
                  (3)  The user has submitted the following information to the superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
                  a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause; 
                  b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
                  (Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 71) 
                  Sec. 74-502. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
                  A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 74-275(a) of this article or the specific prohibitions in subsections 74-275(b)(3) through (18), excluding subsection 74-275(b)(8), of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  (1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or 
                  (2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the county was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

                  Sec. 74-503. - Bypass. 
                  (a)  For the purposes of this section: 
                  (1)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  (2)  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  (2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited and the superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  b.  There was no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment down time or preventive maintenance; and 
                  c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section 
                  (2)  The superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

                  Sec. 74-511. - Generally. 
                  (a)  A permit from the county shall be obtained before a sewer tap is made, and such permit shall indicate that the prescribed fee has been made. 
                  (b)  Any unauthorized person making a tap shall be punished upon conviction of an offense. 
                  (c)  Nonwater customers and those obtaining water from wells using the county sewer system are required to meter well pumpage and shall be charged the regular sewer service fees. The property owners shall pay the cost of the meter and installation by the water department. 
                  (d)  Fees associated with excessive discharges of conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, COD) may or may not be punitive as deemed by the county. 
                  (e)  Fines for conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, COD) can be waived, provided no harm occurred to the POTW, at the discretion of the county on a case-by-case basis. 
                  (f)  Wastewater discharges between 300 mg/L and 850 mg/L of BOD and/or TSS will be assessed a surcharge. Enforcement shall be initiated for discharges exceeding 600 mg/L. The purpose of the surcharge is to encourage treatment of wastes rather than relying on the POTW to handle excess BOD and/or TSS, and to require industries generating high strength waste to bear the cost. 
                  (g)  For samples with a difficult BOD to measure accurately, chemical oxygen demand (COD) may be substituted for BOD analysis. Wastewater discharges between 750 and 2,500 mg/L of COD will be assessed a surcharge. Enforcement shall be initiated for discharges exceeding 2,500 mg/L.

                  DIVISION 15. - WASTE TREATMENT 

                  Sec. 74-521. - Purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this division to regulate the available types of waste treatment options for individual uses in Bartow County. Bartow County has experience with individual septic systems and traditional gravity flow systems, and such systems are appropriate for the county. Under more limited circumstances, private sewage facilities may be permitted. Bartow County recognizes that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found low pressure sewer systems to have increased energy demands, higher maintenance requirements, and higher costs to the homeowner. The county has further determined that the ongoing maintenance issues created by such systems lead to greater future problems than in a conventional gravity flow sewer system. Such systems have many more mechanical and powered parts and are therefore subject to much higher failure rates. Preventative maintenance requirements are higher, and power outages can result in overflows and damage to residences. Life cycle replacement costs are higher than gravity sewers. Therefore, this division is adopted to regulate and prohibit such systems, in the interest of protecting the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Bartow County.

                  Sec. 74-522. - Definitions. 
                  As used in this division, words shall have their common meaning and significance, except for the specifically defined terms below: 
                  Effluent means the flow of liquids and solids from a structure's sewage plumbing system; e.g., human waste, waste water, etc. 
                  Low pressure sewer system means a sewer system that uses pressure to move the effluent from individual lots to the main sewer lines. Pressure sewers typically break down large solids in a pumping station located on an individual lot before they are transported through the collection system (sewer mains) to the treatment facility. Such systems include grinder pump systems and septic tank effluent pump systems. Systems which use a pump to pump waste from a septic tank to a septic field on the same lot are not included in this definition. 
                  Low pressure sewer system cluster means a pressure sewer system with a common low pressure line that connects several residences by individual pumps to a central or common pump station. 
                  Private sewage facility means a privately-owned sewage treatment facility providing sewage disposal to property owned only by a single owner. Examples would include a facility serving a single industrial site, or a facility serving a mobile home park where all lots are owned by a single owner. 
                  Public sewage facility means a sewage treatment facility providing sewage disposal to more than one property owned by different owners. Examples would include a facility serving an industrial park with several owners, or a facility serving a subdivision with separate homeowners.

                  Sec. 74-523. - Regulation of waste treatment facilities. 
                  (a)  Low pressure sewer systems (including low pressure sewer system clusters) are prohibited in Bartow County. Individual residential lots may either contain individual on-site sewage management systems (i.e., septic systems) approved by the county board of health, or may be connected to a public gravity flow sewer system. Private sewage facilities and public sewage facilities are regulated by the Bartow County Sewer Service Ordinance. 
                  (b)  Sewage treatment and handling systems for individual residential lots not otherwise covered or defined specifically by this division, or as may be invented in the future, shall only be permitted upon approval of the water superintendent. The applicant shall submit an application as required by the county, containing plans, specifications and other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the superintendent. The superintendent shall not permit systems or technologies that are unproven, that increase the risks of environmental contamination, that do not meet the standards contained in the Bartow County Sewer Service Ordinance or other applicable ordinance, that increase costs or burdens on the county's sewer system or to individual property owners, or that are found to be a threat in any way to the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of the county.

If there is a question as to the type of system proposed, or whether it is permitted or prohibited, the Superintendent shall make the final interpretation for the water department. His determination may be appealed to the county commissioner.

                  The county may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the county pretreatment program which may include: 
                  (1)  Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications; 
                  (2)  Fees for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users; 
                  (3)  Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
                  (4)  Fees for filing appeal; and 
                  (5)  Other fees as the county may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this article and are separate from all other fees, fines and penalties chargeable by the county.

                  ARTICLE IV. - WATER AND SEWER RATE STRUCTURE 

                  Sec. 74-571. - Purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to collect the fees necessary to maintain and operate the Bartow County Water and Sewer System, including to pay for the expansion of the system to handle the needs of Bartow County. The county owns and operates public water treatment and transmission/distribution facilities, as well as purchasing potable water from Cartersville and other public water systems. The county owns two wastewater (sewer) treatment facilities, collection/transmission and disposal facilities, as well as sending wastewater to Cartersville and Cobb County for treatment. The county provides water and wastewater services to both residential and nonresidential customers within the unincorporated areas of the county. 
                  As a result of recent growth, regulatory requirements, and the need to prepare for the cost of meeting future system demands, the county conducted a review of water and wastewater rates. Over the last several years, water and wastewater rates have not kept pace with increasing costs. A study was commissioned from consultants Black and Veatch that determined a recommended rate structure to meet the county's goals of full cost recovery of operating the system, including readiness to serve rates sufficient to support future financing of capital projects. In addition, the new rate structure is designed to encourage conservation. Over the next five years, the county anticipates spending approximately $52,000,000.00 on the water and wastewater system to increase capacity by expanding wastewater treatment facilities, adding new water storage tanks, and meeting increasing regulatory requirements (as detailed in the plans of the county and the Black and Veatch study). The rates and charges developed as a result of that study, are designed to both provide the necessary capital to fund expansion of the system and also to provide adequate funding for ongoing operational costs for the system. The readiness to serve fees are specifically calculated as a proportionate share of the impact on the county's capacity of each new user, and are designed to generate the funds sufficient to provide the capacity needed by that user, as well as recover capital costs already expended in providing the existing capacity to serve the user, as allowed under O.C.G.A. § 36-71-13(c), and as approved by the Court of Appeals in City of Griffin v. McDaniel, 270 Ga.App. 349, 606 S.E.2d 607 (2004).

                  Sec. 74-572. - Monthly rate schedule. 
                  The county shall bill its customers monthly for water and wastewater service, at the following rates. Water and wastewater rates shall be comprised of an availability charge, and a volume charge. The availability charge recovers various fixed costs of providing service, and increases based on the water meter size (in equivalent meter units). The availability and volume charges are billed monthly. Water and wastewater availability rates are both based on the water meter size, converted into equivalent meter units, multiplied by the base charges. The volume charge is based on usage. 
                  (1)  Water rates. 
                  Water availability charge/base charge x EMU of water meter 
                  Water availability base charge ..... $4.00 per month 
                  Water volume charge ..... 3.30 per 1,000 gallons 
                  (2)  Wastewater rates. 
                  Wastewater availability charge/base charge x EMU of water meter 
                  Wastewater availability base charge ..... $4.00 per month 
                  Wastewater volume charge ..... 3.30 per 1,000 gallons 
                  (3)  Equivalent meter units. All availability charges are based on equivalent meter units (EMU), which are shown below, based on the size of the water meter. EMUs are multiplied by the base charges shown above to arrive at the availability charge, as shown by example in subsection (4) below. 

                   
                  (4)  Examples. The following examples are in effect until December 31, 2006 as water and wastewater availability charges. After that, rates increase pursuant to section 74-579 below. 

                   
                  (5)  Water conservation surcharge. A water conservation surcharge shall be added to the above rates pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. The "base rate" as referred to in this section, shall mean both the "availability base charge" and the "volume charge" for water and wastewater rates; that is, both charges shall be modified by the percentage multiplier of the water conservation surcharge. The relevant provisions of that ordinance are incorporated herein by reference, as adopted December 6, 2006, and as amended hereinafter in the future. 
                  (Ord. of 12-7-2005(4); Ord. of 12-6-2006) 
                  Sec. 74-573. - Readiness to serve fees. 
                  The county shall collect "readiness to serve fees," which are comprised of several elements. There is both a "water capacity fee" and a "wastewater capacity fee," which fees are based on recovering a proportional cost of water or wastewater capacity provided to the user, and paying for future expansions of capacity necessitated by that user. For the water system, there is also a "distribution and transmission fee," to recover proportional costs of the distribution and transmission system as used by that user and future expansion necessitated by that user. For wastewater (i.e. sewer) there is a "collection fee," to recover the proportional costs of the wastewater collection system as used by that user and future expansion necessitated by that user. These are one-time fees, collected when a new user applies for a water and/or sewer tap. Water and wastewater readiness to serve fees are both based on the water meter size, converted into equivalent meter units, multiplied by the base charges. 
                  (1)  Water readiness to serve fees. 
                  Water capacity fee ..... base charge x EMU of water meter 
                  Water capacity base charge ..... $1,030.00 
                  Water distribution and transmission fee ..... base charge x EMU of water meter 
                  Water distribution and transmission base charge ..... 600.00 
                  (2)  Wastewater readiness to serve fees. 
                  Wastewater capacity fee ..... base charge x EMU of water meter 
                  Wastewater capacity base charge ..... $1,260.00, per equivalent meter unit 
                  Wastewater collection fee ..... base charge x EMU of water meter 
                  Wastewater collection base charge ..... 700.00, per equivalent meter unit 
                  (3)  Equivalent meter units. All readiness to serve fees (both water and wastewater) are based on equivalent meter units (EMU), which are shown below, based on the size of the water meter. EMUs are multiplied by the base charges shown above to arrive at the readiness to serve fee. 

                   
                  (4)  Examples. The following examples are in effect until December 31, 2006. After that, rates increase pursuant to section 74-576 below. The readiness to serve fee for a standard 5/8 -inch residential water meter would be $1,630.00 ($1,030.00 × 1.0, plus $600.00 × 1.0).

The readiness to serve fee for wastewater for property where the water meter is four inches would be $49,000.00 ($1,260.00 × 25.0 = $31,500.00, plus $700.00 × 25.0 = $17,500.00). 
                  (5)  Time of payment. The readiness to serve fees shall be due and payable in full at the time of initial application for service. No connections shall be made to the water or sewer system until all such fees have been accepted by the county.

No payment of any costs, submitting of any petition, or any other act to receive water or sewer service, shall guarantee water or sewer service.

                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ; Ord. of 4-11-2018(1) , § I) 
                  Sec. 4.2. - District boundaries; official zoning maps. 
                  The boundaries of each district are as shown on a series of maps which collectively are entitled "Official Zoning Maps, Bartow County, Georgia" and certified by the zoning administrator. Said maps and all explanatory matter thereon are hereby made a part of and incorporated into this ordinance by reference. Said maps shall be retained in the office of the county's zoning administrator and are available for public inspection during the business hours of the zoning office, which is located in the Frank Moore Administrative and Judicial Center, 135 W. Cherokee Avenue, Cartersville. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 4.3. - Rules for determining boundaries. 
                  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as shown on the zoning maps or future land use map, the following rules shall apply: 
                  4.3.1 Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets or highways, street lines, or highway rights-of-way lines, such center lines, street lines, or highway rights-of-way lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  4.3.2 Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries. 
                  4.3.3 Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the center lines of streets, highways, railroads, or rights-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on said map. 
                  4.3.4 Where a district boundary line, as appearing on a map, divides a lot in single ownership at the time of this enactment into two or more classifications, the district requirements for the larger portion shall apply to the entire lot. 
                  4.3.5 It is recognized that discrepancies or conflicts can occur between the official zoning maps and the official county clerk's records (minutes) of actions taken by the commissioner with respect to a specific parcel, either because of scriveners' errors or in amendment of the official maps. In the event such a discrepancy or conflict, the official county clerk's records shall prevail. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 4.4. - Future land use map. 
                  By this section, the future land use map adopted by resolution of the commissioner on December 6, 2006 and as thereafter amended, is established as the official policy of the county concerning proposed land uses, under which the unincorporated areas of the county are divided into land use categories. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 4.5. - Future land use map distinguished from zoning. 
                  The future land use map does not alter or affect the existing zoning districts in the county, does not effectuate an amendment to the official zoning map, and does not itself permit or prohibit any existing land uses. However, it is the policy of the county to make every effort to keep zoning districts consistent with the future land use map classifications. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 4.6. - Land use districts. 
                  The boundaries of the various land use districts are shown upon the future land use map and shall be used as a guide for decision making by the county. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 4.7. - Interpretation of land use district boundaries. 
                  Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any land use districts shown on the future land use map, the rules set forth in section 4.3 shall apply. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 4.8. - Relationship between land use categories and zoning districts. 
                  It is the goal of the county that the land use categories established by the future land use map are to be implemented with appropriate zoning classifications, and that rezonings should be kept consistent with the future land use map wherever possible. If a zoning district is not listed as permitted in a land use district, application should first be made to change the land use district prior to amending the zoning district. Such applications can proceed simultaneously, but it is the goal of the county that no property should be zoned to a classification inconsistent with its land use district. However, the county commissioner has the power to grant rezonings inconsistent with the future land use map, which is only a policy guideline. 
                  The land use categories established by the future land use map are to be implemented by the establishment of appropriate zoning districts within each category. The following zoning districts are considered most compatible with the listed land use district: 
                  (A)  Low density residential: R-1, R-2, R-4, RE-1, and RE-2. 
                  (B)  Medium/high density residential: R-3, R-6. 
                  (C)  Rural estate: RE-1, RE-2; also R-1 and R-4, excluding R-1 or R-4 subdivisions of three or more lots.

                  (E)  Commercial: C-1, C-N, O/I. 
                  (F)  Commercial/mixed use: Predominantly C-1, C-N, O/I; also allows R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-6, PUD. 
                  (G)  Industrial: I-1, I-2, BP. 
                  (H)  Mining: M-1. 
                  (I)  Agriculture: A-1; also R-1, R-4, RE-1, RE-2, excluding any R-1, R-4, or RE subdivisions of three or more lots. 
                  (J)  Public/institutional: A-1, RE-1, RE-2, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-6, O/I, C-N, C-1, I-1, I-2, M-1. 
                  (K)  Park/recreation/conservation: A-1, RE-1, RE-2, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-6. 
                  (L)  Forestry: A-1; also R-1, R-4, RE-1, RE-2, excluding R-1, R-4 or RE subdivisions of three or more lots.

                  Sec. 5.5. - Lots; creation of illegal lots. 
                  5.5.1 Lot reduction. It is not permitted to reduce an existing lot below minimum standards. Specifically, no lot shall be reduced in size so that the mandatory lot frontage or depth; front, side or rear yard; width at building line; or lot area are not maintained. Lots of record that do not meet existing standards may not be reduced. This section shall not apply when a portion of a lot is acquired for public purposes. 
                  5.5.2 Illegal Lots. It is not permitted to split or subdivide any lot if any of the resultant lots are under the minimum size lot allowed in the zoning district. Creation of a new lot under the minimum size requirement of the relevant zoning district is not permitted, nor is leaving a remnant under the minimum size requirement. It is not permitted to reduce an existing lot's size under the minimum size requirement. Any subdivision or creation of a substandard lot is illegal, and shall not create any vested right nor permit any non-conforming use. 
                  5.5.3 Substandard single lots. Where the owner of a lot of record or his successor in title thereto does not own sufficient land to enable him to conform to the dimensional requirements of this ordinance, such lot may be used as a building site for a single-family residence in a district where residences are permitted. 
                  5.5.4 Substandard adjoining lots. If two or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage are in a single ownership at any time after September 22, 1993 (the date this provision was initially imposed) and such lots individually are too small to meet the yard, width, and area requirements of the district in which they are located, such groups of lots shall be considered as a single lot or several lots of minimum permitted size and the lot or lots in one ownership shall be subject to the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  5.5.5 The county reserves the right to take legal action to reverse illegal lot creations, illegal lot splits, or other actions in violation of this section, including creation of substandard-sized lots or remnants.

                  Sec. 5.6. - Road frontage restrictions; private driveways and easements. 
                  5.6.1 No new lot shall be created, nor shall any principal building be erected, on any lot which does not have immediate frontage, of a minimum amount as specified below, on at least one existing public road (meaning a county road or state highway) or on a newly created internal street in a development. The only exception to this requirement is detailed below in section 5.6.7. The minimum road frontage requirements are defined below based on the underlying zoning district. 
                  5.6.2 A-1. For existing tracts of land zoned A-1, and located on existing public roads, a minimum of 200 feet of road frontage is required. For new developments in A-1 with internal streets, a minimum of 100 feet of road frontage is required, 50 feet on culs-de-sac. 
                  5.6.3 R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4. For existing tracts of land zoned R-1, R-2, R-3 or R-4, and located on existing public roads, a minimum of 200 feet of road frontage is required. For new developments in R-1 and R-4 with internal streets, a minimum of 100 feet of road frontage is required, 25 feet on culs-de-sac. 
                  5.6.4 RE-1, RE-2. For existing tracts of land zoned RE-1 and RE-2, and located on existing public roads, a minimum of 200 feet of road frontage is required. For new developments in RE-1 and RE-2 with internal streets, a minimum of 100 feet of road frontage is required, 50 feet on culs-de-sac. 
                  5.6.5 O/I, C-N, C-1, I-1, I-2. Any new lot zoned O/I, C-N, C-1, I-1 and I-2, or any tract of land rezoned to O/I, C-N, C-1, I-1 or I-2, must have at least 100 feet of road frontage. 
                  5.6.6 The zoning administrator has authority to administratively vary the requirements in this section under the procedures of section 14.1, except that the maximum reduction granted may be up to 50 percent. 
                  5.6.7 No more than two lots or dwellings sharing one private easement or driveway shall be allowed. No further subdivision will be allowed unless a street is constructed to county standards, whether it remains private or dedicated to the county. Only one private easement is allowed per parent tract.

                  Sec. 5.7. - Lot splits; recording of plats. 
                  No lot shall be split nor shall any plat be recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county without a signature of approval on the following signature block: 
                  This plat meets the requirements of the Bartow County Zoning Ordinance and Development Regulations and is authorized to be recorded. 
                  ___________  Signature 
                  ___________  Date 
                  Such signature block shall only be signed by the community development director or his or her designee, upon review that the lots shown on the proposed plat meet the requirements for road frontage, minimum lot size, and all other applicable requirements of the Bartow County Code of Ordinances, appendix A (zoning ordinance) and appendix B (development regulations). Any plat recorded after the effective date of this amendment without such signature block shall be an illegal plat and shall vest no rights in the property owner. The county reserves the right to take legal action to reverse illegal lot creations, illegal lot splits, or other actions in violation of this section, including creation of substandard-sized lots or remnants. 
                  ARTICLE VI. - REGULATION OF PROPERTY 

                  Sec. 6.1. - Continuance of a non-conforming use. 
                  Any pre-existing lawful non-conforming use of or vested right to use any building, structure or land existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance (September 22, 1993), or the adoption of any amendment hereto, may be continued subject to the restrictions contained in this ordinance, even though such use does not conform with the regulations of this ordinance, except that: 
                  6.1.1 A non-conforming use or structure shall not be changed to another non-conforming use. 
                  6.1.2 A non-conforming use or structure shall not be expanded, extended, or enlarged beyond the area of use, size of operation, and/or the size of the structures existing at the time the use became non-conforming. A non-conforming use cannot be expanded onto another parcel or tract of land. A non-conforming use on a portion of a single lot or tract of land may not be expanded even within that lot or tract of land to portions that were not in use at the time the use became non-conforming. For example, if a non-conforming junk yard (including all offices, junk cars, equipment and other piles of junk) was occupying ten acres of a fifty-acre tract of land when it became non-conforming, the use may not be expanded onto the other 40 acres. Similarly, no building containing a non-conforming use can be expanded or enlarged. 
                  6.1.3 A non-conforming use or structure shall not be re-established after discontinuance for one year regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon. 
                  6.1.4 A non-conforming use or structure shall not be rebuilt, altered, or repaired except as provided herein: 
                  (A)  If the structure is altered or repaired, said alterations or repairs shall be in conformity with the building codes in force at the time of said alteration or repair; provided, however, that said alteration or repair shall not extend or enlarge the structure being altered or repaired; 
                  (B)  If the structure is totally rebuilt, the replacement structure shall conform to all the requirements of this ordinance, except as to the district; provided, however, said replacement structure may not occupy an area greater than the replaced structure. However, the replacement of a single-family home (including site-built and manufactured homes) must meet all current requirements of section X of the zoning ordinance. 
                  6.1.5 Uses and structures made non-conforming by new provisions in this ordinance shall be limited to the area of use, size of operation, height, and/or size of structures as existing on the date of adoption of this ordinance. 
                  6.1.6 Uses and structures made non-conforming by prior versions of this ordinance shall be limited to the area of use, size of operation, height and/or size of structures as existing on the date of adoption of the relevant provision by the prior ordinance. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 6.2. - Operation of business from residential district prohibited. 
                  Unless specifically permitted as a use under the applicable provision of article VII, no business or commercial enterprise may operate in a residentially-zoned district, including A-1 and any R district. Operation of a business or commercial enterprise shall include, but not be limited to, such activities as: having employees report to work at the property; storing commercial vehicles at the property; parking commercial vehicles at the property (other than as specifically permitted by section 6.8); conducting any manufacturing or assembly at the property; retail or wholesale sales of any sort; providing any service, maintenance or repair at the property (other than permitted home occupations); and storage of any materials, supplies, products, or components at the property. Home offices and home occupations are permitted as shown in sections 6.3 and 6.4. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 6.3. - Home offices. 
                  Home offices are permitted in any home, allowing the occupant to work from home, or to manage a business licensed as a "mobile business." No customers, suppliers or vendors shall be permitted at a home office. Employees are not permitted to report to work, receive assignments, or pick up vehicles at a home office. No non-resident of the home may work in the home office (i.e., no outside employees may work in the office). See also section 6.2. Home occupations are permitted as stated in section 6.4. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 6.4. - Home occupations. 
                  Home occupations are permitted in zoning districts as listed in article VII. No home occupation shall occupy more than 30 percent of the heated floor space of the principal use building. No separate building or structure may be constructed to house a home occupation. A home occupation must be a use that is clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling as a residence and that does not change the character thereof or reveal from the exterior that the dwelling is being used in part for other than a residence. No non-resident of the home may work in the home occupation (i.e., no non-resident employees). There shall be no display, stock in trade, or commodity sold on the premises, and no mechanical equipment used except such as is commonly used for purely domestic household purposes. Such permissible occupations include, in general, such personal services such as are furnished by a musician, artist, seamstress, cook, or laundress, consultant, telecommuter, or other occupation which does not generate non-residential traffic nor has non-occupant employees, but shall not include such uses as barbershops, beauty parlors, tea rooms, animal hospitals, animal grooming, or a wholesale, retail or manufacturing business. No signs related to the home occupation are allowed. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 6.5. - Residential living only permitted in permanent structures. 
                  No lot may be used for temporary or permanent residential living quarters unless a permanent dwelling unit has been lawfully erected on the lot, pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance and applicable building and safety codes. Indications that a property is being used as temporary or permanent residential living quarters include actions such as spending significant time at the location on more than one day, repeated eating and sleeping at the location, and performing other life activities at the location repeatedly. 
                  Tents, boats, RVs and other structures that are not permitted permanent dwelling units cannot be occupied either on a permanent or temporary basis on a residential lot, except that tents may be occupied for no more than three days in any two-month period when erected in the rear yard of a permanent dwelling unit. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 6.6. - Occupancy of recreational vehicles.

                  Recreational vehicles can be occupied as temporary dwellings as a temporary accessory use, for no more than ten days in any two-month period, only if there is a permanent dwelling unit as a principal use on the lot, and only if the vehicle is parked in conformance with this ordinance. No more than one recreational vehicle can be so occupied on the same lot.

                  Sec. 6.7. - Recreational vehicle parking. 
                  Recreational vehicles parked in any residential zone or residentially-used area shall not be permitted to be parked in any required set-back or buffer area, nor in any front-yard area. Recreational vehicles on residential property shall only be parked in the side or rear yard, within setbacks, although the zoning administrator may administratively vary this requirement if there is not sufficient room in or access to the rear or side yards. No more than two recreational vehicles shall be parked on any single residential lot. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 6.8. - Commercial vehicle parking. 
                  6.8.1 No more than two commercial vehicles (trailers counted separately if separated from a tractor) shall be parked on any single residential lot, or on any lot in any residentially-zoned lot, including A-1 or any R district. Commercial vehicles may not be parked on any residential lot without an occupied single-family dwelling, and may not be parked on vacant residential lots. 
                  6.8.2 On A-1 zoned property of over five acres that contains a working agricultural business, commercial vehicles related to such business may be parked. 
                  6.8.3 Commercial vehicles parked in any residential zone (including A-1) or residentially-used area shall not be permitted to be parked in any required set-back or buffer area. Commercial vehicles on any lot under five acres must be parked in the side or rear yard area. The zoning administrator shall be permitted to grant a hardship administrative variance to allow parking in a setback or front yard if no other room exists. 
                  6.8.4 The zoning administrator shall be permitted to grant a hardship administrative variance to allow up to four commercial vehicles to park on one lot (for example, if four family members living there each drive a commercial vehicle home from work), but in no circumstance shall such variance be used to permit employees to report to a residential structure on a daily basis to pick up commercial vehicles for the company's operation. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 6.9. - Use of vehicle or trailers for storage prohibited. 
                  Neither vehicles (whether operable or inoperable) nor trailers (whether on or off their axles) may be used as storage buildings. This shall apply to all vehicles and trailers, including commercial vehicles, recreational vehicles, panel vans, tractor-trailer rigs, railroad box-cars, etc. However, tractor-trailer rigs and trailers may be used for temporary storage on property zoned C-1, I-1, I-2 or M-1, only by businesses operating on the same property. Temporary storage means no particular trailer may remain longer than three months. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 6.10. - Outside sales, yard sales, open air markets. 
                  Outside sales are not permitted on any residentially-zoned or -used lot, except as provided in this section. Yard sales and garage sales (or carport sales) shall be permitted on any residential lot, no more frequently than once per calendar quarter. Such sale may not continue for more than 72 hours. Flea markets (i.e., where vendors other than the property owner sell goods) are not permitted in any zoning district in the county.

                  Sec. 6.11. - Appearance of property. 
                  In order to preserve the aesthetic beauty of the county, and protect against nuisances, hazards, vermin and odor, among other hazards, and to preserve the property values of surrounding property, all property in the county shall be required to comply with the following provisions: 
                  6.11.1 All property (other than where explicitly permitted, such as a junk yard or salvage yard) must be free of the following: scrap metal; junked, inoperative or broken appliances (including engines and vehicles or parts of vehicles); junked, inoperative or broken equipment (such as lawn mowers, bicycles, machines); construction or demolition debris; other waste, garbage or refuse such as old tires, discarded carpet, discarded household furniture, bottles, cans, or similar; stumps, branches, dirt, and other debris from land disturbance and grading (except incident to a permit under the Bartow County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Ordinance for the subject property and/or pursuant to lawful construc tion on the subject property); and household trash (except in a trash container). Such items may be kept in an enclosed building or enclosed garage erected pursuant to a building permit or otherwise lawfully permitted, but may not be kept in the open. 
                  6.11.2 All property, whether residential, commercial or industrial, containing a grass lawn (for example fescue, rye, bluegrass, bermuda, zoysia or similar grasses), landscaping strips, or other landscaping must be maintained so that the grass is kept cut below the height of 12 inches, and so that shrubbery, weeds and other landscaping is kept cut to the point where no windows or doors in a structure are obscured or blocked. This shall include landscaping on the right-of-way. Grass fields grown for grazing or other agricultural purposes and sod farms shall be exempt, except that in no event shall the front and side yards of a residentially-used structure be exempt. In order to prevent vacant and undeveloped lots from becoming a nuisance, all grass and vegetation within 25 feet of the back of the curb or edge of pavement of any vacant or undeveloped lot (whether residential, commercial or industrial), must be kept cut below a height of 12 inches, except for trees larger than two inches DBH which may be saved. This shall include vegetation on the right-of-way. 
                  6.11.3 Storage of lumber, dumpsters, wood pallets, pipe, concrete blocks, other construction material, or other commercial material, or any commercial inventory (including products for sale, use or repair in off-site businesses), or materials associated with a commercial operation, shall be prohibited on residentially-zoned or residentially-used property, unless associated with or required by a permitted use on the property (including repair or construction of a structure that is itself a permitted use, e.g., construction of a single-family residence on said property).

                  6.12.5 This section shall not be the exclusive regulation of abandoned, discarded, dismantled, wrecked, scrapped, ruined or junk motor vehicles, or contrivances, within the unincorporated limits of the county, but shall be supplemental to and in addition to other regulations and ordinances of the county and statutes or provisions of law heretofore and hereinafter enacted by the county, state or other legal entity or agency having jurisdiction. See also, section 6.11. 
                  6.12.6 In all instances where the owner of any abandoned, inoperative, or junk motor vehicle and/or trailer cannot be determined, or when such vehicle is abandoned on public property or a non-owner's property, such junk or abandoned motor vehicle and/or trailer shall be removed under the authority and provisions of O.C.G.A chapter 40-11. If on public property, such vehicle may be removed after five days; if on private property, it may be removed after 30 days. 
                  6.12.7 In all instances where the owner of any junk, inoperative, unregistered, or abandoned motor vehicle and/or trailer refuses to remove, enclose or register (or, if requested, refuses to give consent for the county to remove) any such vehicle or trailer currently in violation of this ordinance, the county shall be empowered to seek an order from a court of competent jurisdiction authorizing the county to remove and dispose of such vehicle or trailer. In addition, if the vehicle or trailer is determined to be a health hazard or a nuisance, the county shall be empowered to seek an order from a court of competent jurisdiction authorizing the county to remove and dispose of such vehicle. Such orders shall be authorized if the vehicle has been in violation of this ordinance for more than 20 days. 
                  6.12.8 For purposes of repair or restoration, one inoperable and unregistered vehicle may be kept in the rear yard of a property, provided it is not visible from the street, is screened from all neighbors by a privacy fence in the rear yard, and is repaired or restored, removed, or placed in a fully enclosed building within six months. Such vehicle shall not be stored in any side yard or any setback or buffer area.

Mothballing is defined as a method used to protect a vacant structure from weather damage and vandals while preserving the structure for future use. Prior to mothballing the property owner(s) must register the property with the zoning administrator and receive a permit to mothball. The property will be inspected for compliance upon completion. The mothballed property shall automatically have its certificate of occupancy revoked.

                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 7.16. - Conservation subdivision (special district). 
                  7.16.1 Purpose. It is the purpose and intent of the county in enacting these regulations to provide for increased greenspace in the county, and to preserve open land in perpetuity for future generations, while not increasing the overall development levels for the county. The purpose is further to increase the aesthetic beauty of the county, improve the value of adjacent property, and generally serve to enhance the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the county. 
                  7.16.2 Procedure. A conservation subdivision allows increased residential density in conjunction with the fee simple grant of undeveloped and undisturbed greenspace to the county or to such land trust as the county may designate. The applicant seeking to develop a conservation subdivision must meet with the zoning administrator and provide a survey of the entire tract, prior to placement of lots and roads. The county and the applicant shall then agree upon the tract to be donated. Where possible, the tract to be donated should link up with other greenspace tracts or trails. A minimum of one-half of the total acreage of the parcel must be donated to qualify for a conservation subdivision. Alternative greenspace arrangements are also available. See section 7.16.9. 
                  7.16.3 Applicable districts. A conservation subdivision is permissible in the following zoning districts: R-1, R-2, R-4, RE-1, and RE-2. 
                  7.16.4 Development regulations. In a conservation subdivision, the following development standards shall apply. 
                  (A)  Minimum lot size is reduced by 50 percent from the existing minimum residential lot size under that zoning classification, if sewer is available. For example, in authorized R districts, minimum lot size reduces to 7,500 square feet. In RE districts, minimum lot size becomes 1.5 acres. If sewer is not to be used for waste disposal, the minimum lot size shall be 50 percent of the existing minimum, or the amount required by the health department, whichever is greater. 
                  (B)  The overall density of lots shall not exceed that number which would be permissible under the normal development standards; gross density shall not be increased, except as provided in subparagraph (C) below. 
                  (C)  Curb and gutter shall not be required in conservation subdivisions in RE-1 and RE-2 districts. In RE-1 and RE-2 districts only, a 20 percent density bonus shall be granted if the developer chooses to install curb and gutter, and the lot size shall be reduced sufficiently to grant this bonus; however, health department regulations shall still apply. 
                  (D)  In the R-1, R-2 and R-4 districts, front setbacks are reduced to 15 feet, and rear setbacks are reduced to 20 feet. The minimum width at the building line is reduced to 75 feet. The setbacks and minimum building line width for RE-1 and RE-2 are not changed. 
                  7.16.5 Greenspace areas. Greenspace areas shall include, but not be limited to, wetlands, river buffer zones, woodlands, wildlife corridors, pastures, meadows, and similar natural property. Greenspace areas shall be contiguous on the parcel. Greenspace shall be contiguous to other greenspace parcels, county parks, corps of engineer property, national parks, and similar preserved land where possible. Greenspace land shall be undisturbed and undeveloped. Greenspace must be accessible by a county or state road, or by easement. Hunting shall not be permitted in greenspace areas and any deed of conveyance of greenspace to the county or land trust shall contain a deed restriction to that effect. 
                  7.16.6 Standards. Approval of a conservation subdivision shall be granted or denied by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall consider the following factors: 
                  (A)  Whether the applicant has designated and offered to dedicate appropriate amounts and locations of greenspace. 
                  (B)  Whether the conservation subdivision would be detrimental to the surrounding uses. 
                  (C)  Whether the terrain or location of the property is not suitable for a conservation subdivision, or is not desirable as greenspace. 
                  (D)  Whether the area remaining after dedication of greenspace is suitable for development at the proposed density. 
                  7.16.7 Approval, post-approval procedure. The zoning administrator shall issue written approval or denial of the conservation subdivision. Upon approval of the conservation subdivision, the applicant shall cause a survey and legal description to be prepared of the greenspace. Greenspace shall be clearly identified on all preliminary plans and all development plans. Greenspace shall be dedicated to a land trust as the developer may designate, the county, or to the home owners' association prior to approval of the final plat, by fee simple deed, to be preserved in perpetuity as greenspace. Appeal of the approval of a conservation subdivision must be initiated within 30 days of written approval by the zoning administrator of the conservation subdivision. If an appeal is initiated, the applicant may withhold dedication until the appeal is completed. 
                  7.16.8 Appeal. Appeal of the zoning administrator's decision to approve or deny a conservation subdivision can be taken by the applicant or any aggrieved citizen by filing a notice of appeal within thirty days with the zoning administrator, who shall forward the appeal directly to the board of appeals. The board of appeals shall hear the appeal at the next available hearing. Appeals from the board of appeals shall be to the commissioner pursuant to article XIV. 
                  7.16.9 Alternative greenspace. In a conservation subdivision, the applicant may propose alternatives from the standard requirement. The applicant may propose purchasing an equivalent amount of greenspace adjacent and contiguous to existing county greenspace elsewhere in the county; the applicant may propose donating an equivalent amount of greenspace to an approved land trust; or the applicant may propose submitting funds to purchase an equivalent amount of greenspace, to be paid into a county greenspace bank for future purchase of greenspace at the county's discretion. Such dollar amounts would be based on appraisals approved by the zoning administrator, at pre-development values. Payment or contribution of land shall occur prior to approval of the final plat. Any alternative greenspace arrangement must be approved by the commissioner. Alternative greenspace arrangements require the voluntary cooperation of the applicant; otherwise, the standard requirement shall apply.

                  Sec. 7.17. - Etowah Valley historic district (special district). 
                  7.17.1 Purpose. It is the purpose and intent of the county in enacting these regulations to provide for the identification of and protection of historical and cultural artifacts and sacred locations of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation and the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation, which are two Native American Nations that are historically connected to the Etowah River Valley (referred to collectively as "Native American Nations"). The identification and protection of such artifacts and locations is of great benefit to the public welfare, in that it preserves and promotes understanding of the county's and the nation's history, enhances the aesthetic environment, encourages proper economic development, provides tourism opportunities, and benefits all citizens. This ordinance further honors the agreement made with the Nations by the county. Property in the Etowah Valley historic district is subject to additional procedures prior to rezoning or development, in order to achieve these purposes. 
                  7.17.2 District established. The Etowah Valley historic district is an overlay district, the boundaries of which are depicted on the map described in section 7.17.3. All provisions of the underlying zoning district shall continue to apply in addition to the requirements of this section. In cases of conflict, the stricter requirement shall control. 
                  7.17.3 District boundaries. The boundaries of the Etowah Valley historic district shall be as depicted on the map designated "Bartow County Etowah Valley Historic District," dated August 6, 2003, which map is incorporated into this ordinance by reference, and which map shall be kept in the office of the zoning administrator and shall be available for public inspection at all times.

Each Nation may submit its own survey. Any survey shall be prepared to the standards of section 7.17.6. The Nations shall submit such survey or recommendation to the applicant and the zoning administrator within thirty days of receipt of the application. If no survey is submitted, the Nations' archaeologist shall at least make a recommendation, consistent with his or her best professional judgment, as to what action should be taken on the site, e.g.: further survey, removal, avoidance, mitigation, preservation in place, data recovery, or other actions. 
                  7.17.6 Archaeological survey standards. 
                  (A)  Archaeological surveys shall be prepared by a qualified archaeologist, as defined in section 7.17.10. Archaeological surveys shall be prepared pursuant to the standards contained in the archaeological assessment report guidelines and components, produced by the state department of natural resources, historic preservation division ("HPD"). Surveys shall be "intensive level surveys" as defined in that document. Surveys shall identify any significant sites, historic sites or artifacts, or prehistoric sites or artifacts on the property. A "significant" site is a site that is listed, or potentially would be eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic Places. 
                  (B)  If any archaeological survey reveals any significant sites, historic sites or artifacts, or prehistoric sites or artifacts, the archaeologist preparing the survey shall make a recommendation, consistent with his or her best professional judgment, as to what action should be taken on the site, e.g.: further survey, removal, avoidance, mitigation, preservation in place, data recovery, or other actions. If the survey reveals no significant sites, historic sites or artifacts, or prehistoric sites or artifacts, the archaeologist shall so state. 
                  (C)  The survey shall also include a resume, CV, or other documents demonstrating that the author is a qualified archaeologist as defined in section 7.17.10. 
                  (D)  Potential applicants are advised, but not required, to commission a "reconnaissance level survey" well in advance of significant development expenditures, to identify issues as early as possible. Neither notice nor filing of that report is required. 
                  7.17.7 Survey review and decisions; referral to state historic preservation division. 
                  (A)  The "intensive level" archaeological survey shall be submitted with the application for development permits, and shall be available to the public. Comments shall be accepted from the Native American Nations and any other party wishing to comment, in written form. The Nations may also submit a survey or recommendation from a qualified archaeologist, as discussed in section 7.17.5, above. Each nation may submit its own recommendation. The zoning administrator shall have the longer of 60 days from the date of filing of the application and survey, or 30 days from the date of receipt of the last certified mail "return receipt" indicating notice to the Nations, or 30 days from the receipt of the Nations' survey or comments, for initial review of the archaeological survey. One extension of up to 60 days may be granted of this period at the discretion of the zoning administrator. 
                  (B)  In regards to whether any significant historic or prehistoric sites or artifacts exist, and what action if any should be taken with such sites or artifacts, the county shall follow the recommendation of the applicant's qualified archaeologist, unless the Nations submit a different recommendation from their own qualified archaeologist. 
                  (C)  In the event there is a dispute between the applicant's archaeologist and the Nations' archaeologist over the existence of significant historic or prehistoric sites or artifacts, or a dispute over what action should be taken with such sites or artifacts, the surveys and recommendations from both the applicant and the Nations shall be submitted to the state department of natural resources, historic preservation division ("HPD"), at 156 Trinity Avenue, SW, Suite 101, Atlanta, GA 30303-3600, with a request for technical resource assistance, and a recommendation on action to take. The HPD shall be informed in the request that if no recommendation is received within 60 days from the date the request is mailed, the recommendation of the applicant's archaeologist shall be accepted. 
                  (D)  In the event assistance is requested from the historic preservation division, the county shall await the HPD's recommendation, and shall refer to and rely upon the HPD's comments, and implement the HPD's recommendation. If no response is received from the HPD within 60 days from the date the request is mailed, the recommendation of the applicant's archaeologist shall be accepted. 
                  (E)  All other provisions of applicable county ordinances must also be satisfied prior to permits being issued.

                  Sec. 7.18. - Business park district. 
                  7.18.1 Purpose. The purpose of the business park district is to provide uniform regulations for a joint City of Cartersville-Bartow County industrial/business park, a portion of which is located in each jurisdiction. To provide consistency for property owners and future uses, and to benefit the public health, safety and welfare, the city and county have adopted identical regulations as follows. The business park district, where applied via amendment to the official zoning maps of the participating government, shall control over inconsistent regulations contained in other ordinances and the Code of Ordinances of each jurisdiction, whether or not the provisions herein are stronger or weaker restrictions. The purpose of this district is also to provide consistent development standards for other industrial and business parks located in the vicinity of the joint city-county park, so that the area is developed consistently and without incompatible uses or negative impacts on infrastructure, public health, safety or welfare. This district may also in the future be applied to other areas of the county. The provisions of this section control over inconsistent provisions in other sections of this ordinance or other portions of the County Code. 
                  7.18.2 General area, height and setback regulations. 
                  Minimum lot size: one acre. 
                  Maximum lot coverage (impervious surface limitation): 75 percent. 
                  Required lot width at street right-of-way (internal street): 40 feet (25 feet in cul-de-sac). 
                  Front setback: 40 feet. 
                  Side setback: 15 feet. 
                  Rear setback: 20 feet. 
                  Maximum building height (see below): 50 feet. 
                  Buffers (see below): 50 feet except as noted. 
                  (A)  The county or city zoning administrator, dependent upon jurisdiction, may grant an administrative variance of up to 20 percent to any of the general area, height and setback regulations listed above. Additionally, they may grant an administrative variance on the undisturbed buffer requirements, if the proposed landscaping and screening in the buffer enhances the screening of the adjacent property. 
                  (B)  Building height. With the approval of the county or city zoning administrator dependent upon jurisdiction, maximum height may be increased by variance. Building height limitations shall not apply to accessory structures such as water towers, conveyer belts, smoke stacks and other incidental and uninhabited parts of industrial uses. 
                  (C)  Buffers. A fifty-foot buffer shall apply adjacent to all land uses, except that no buffers shall be required from industrial to industrial. Further, there shall be a two hundred-foot buffer required where shown on the overlay district map adjacent to existing residential uses as of the date of adoption of the overlay district. When any of the existing residential uses are rezoned to a non-residential zoning classification, the buffer adjacent to that property shall be reduced to 50 feet, unless it is a similar zoning classification, in which case the buffer requirement shall not apply. Buffers shall be undisturbed, except that, if the buffer is adjacent to a residential use, and is insufficiently dense to be opaque to vision year round, the zoning administrator may require that the buffer shall be planted with sufficient vegetation so that it is opaque year-round, to a depth of at least twenty-five feet. Buffers may be used for perpendicular crossing by access roads and utilities, but not for lateral roads or parking. Buffers may be used for detention ponds, provided that vegetative screening remains or is planted between the pond and the property line. The county or city zoning administrator dependent on jurisdiction shall approve buffer plans and plantings. 
                  (D)  Setbacks shall be measured from the property or lot line. As setback exceptions, the following may intrude into the setback zone: unsupported roof overhangs, steps, walkways and access roads, landscaping and irrigation systems, planters, architectural fences and walls not exceeding 42 inches, and underground utilities and sewers.

Open space must be shown on the plat with notation that it is not buildable and cannot be further subdivided. 
                  The development may be proposed with rear garages accessing alleys. If alleys are two way streets, they must meet standard street widths. If one-way streets, they may be constructed with a minimum width of 14 feet. 
                  Buffers: In addition to required setbacks, a fifteen-foot wide buffer is required along all property lines which abut a single-family zoning district or use, or a non-residential zoning district, in order to provide a visual screen in accordance with subsection 8.2.5 of this appendix. 
                  Special agricultural setbacks: See subsection 8.2.3 for setbacks required for homes built adjacent to existing agricultural structures. 
                  7.20.3 Height exceptions. The height limitation does not apply to structures such as unoccupied and inaccessible architectural features on non-residential buildings (e.g., church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes), monuments, government-owned observation towers, water towers, chimneys, flag poles, aerials, and similar structures. Specific height requirements apply to signs and structures containing signs; see article XI. 
                  7.20.4 Accessory structures. Accessory buildings and structures shall maintain the same front and side yards as the main structure; however, they will not project beyond the established building line. Rear yard setbacks shall be a minimum of ten feet.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - AREA, YARD, HEIGHT AND BUFFER REQUIREMENTS 

                  Sec. 8.1. - Area, yard and height requirements. 
                  8.1.1 Table. The following table summarizes area, yard and height requirements as stated in each individual zoning district in article VII. In the event of a conflict, the requirements stated in article VII shall control. All units in feet unless otherwise indicated. See the applicable zoning district regulations for further information. See section 8.2 for transitional buffer requirements between dissimilar zoning districts. Notes: "Width at street R/W" refers to the width of the lot at the street right-of-way line; i.e., the frontage of the lot. Two values are given, one for lots on existing county roads, and one for lots in newly created developments or subdivisions. Culs-de-sac are special, see footnote 1 to the table. "Front setback from R/W" means the front setback is measured from the right-of-way line, not the street or back of curb. 

                   
                  Footnotes for table 8.1.1: 
                  1 Except on cul-de-sac lots; on such lots, the minimum width of frontage at the street right-of-way line is 50 feet in A-1, RE-1 and RE-2, 25 feet in R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4; and 25 feet in business park district. Buildings on cul-de-sac lots must meet front, side and rear setbacks. 
                  2 Specific height requirements apply to signs, see article XI. Special signage requirements apply to the business park district, see section 7.18.8. The height limitations do not apply to structures such as unoccupied and inaccessible architectural features on commercial or institutional buildings (e.g., church spires, church belfries, cupolas and domes on commercial buildings), monuments, silos (in the A-1 district), government-owned observation towers, water towers, chimneys, smokestacks (in industrial districts), conveyors (in industrial districts), flag poles, masts, aerials, and similar structures, except that none of the above shall, within a three-mile radius of the Cartersville-Bartow County Airport, exceed a height above the "clear zone" required for a safe approach to said airport as set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration. Furthermore, any said structure containing a sign shall be subject to the height requirements of article XI. 
                  3 If the lots use sewer for waste disposal; if sewer is not available, the minimum shall be 26,000 square feet or as specified by the health department, whichever is greater. 
                  4 When abutting a different district, a side and rear yard shall be provided as stated. When abutting an area zoned the same as the subject property, no side or rear yard shall be required, except that minimum fire code requirements shall in all cases be met. 
                  5 If no transitional buffers (i.e., buffers between differing zoning districts) required. If transitional buffers (see section 8.2) are required, the minimum lot size shall be an amount sufficient to accommodate all required buffers, plus one acre in business park, I-1 or I-2 properties, or plus 15,000 square feet in C-1, C-N, and O/I parcels. 
                  6 Setbacks apply to district in general; setbacks and yard areas for individual lots in R-6 governed by section 7.8. 
                  7 In conservation subdivisions (see section 7.16), minimum lot size is 50 percent of the existing minimum lot size: R-1, R-2, and R-4 reduce to 7,500 square feet; RE-1 and RE-2 reduce to 1.5 acres. However, if sewer is not used, the minimum lot size is either 50 percent of the existing minimum, or the minimum amount required by the health department, whichever is greater. 
                  8 In conservation subdivisions (see section 7.16), for "R" districts, the minimum front setback is reduced to 15 feet, the minimum rear setback is reduced to 20 feet, and the minimum width at the building line is reduced to 50 feet. 
                  9 Minimum size for development; minimum lot size governed by section 7.8 and 7.15 respectively. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 8.2. - Required buffers. 
                  8.2.1 Buffers. A buffer area shall be defined as that portion of a lot set aside for separation or screening purposes, pursuant to the applicable provisions of this ordinance, to separate different use districts and or uses on one property from uses on another property of the same use district or a different use district. Transitional buffers are buffers required between dissimilar zoning districts. 
                  8.2.2 Buffer requirements. Mandatory buffer widths are listed under each individual zoning district. 
                  8.2.3 Special agricultural provisions. In order to protect existing agricultural uses from encroachment by new development, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (A)  Major livestock facilities. When any property is rezoned from an A-1 district to any residential district and there is located on adjoining property an existing major livestock enclosure, then no dwelling constructed on the newly rezoned property shall be located less than 100 feet from the adjoining property line on which any of the above are located and less than 500 feet from the closest point of any of the above referred to activities. 
                  (B)  Minor livestock facilities. When any property is rezoned from an A-1 district to any residential district and there is located on adjoining property an existing chicken coop or minor livestock enclosure, then no dwelling constructed on the newly rezoned property shall be located less than 100 feet from the adjoining property line on which any of the above are located and less than 200 feet from the closest point of any of the above referred to activities. 
                  8.2.4 Special exemptions. The following special exceptions apply to buffers and control over general buffer provisions: 
                  (A)  When property zoned C-1, C-N or O/I is separated by a county or state road or federal highway from residentially-zoned property, no buffer shall be required. 
                  (B)  When property zoned I-1 is separated from property in a different zoning classification by a state or federal highway right-of-way of at least 100 feet in width, the required buffer for the I-1 property along such right-of-way shall be reduced to 50 feet. 
                  (C)  When property zoned C-1 or C-N is located adjacent to property zoned A-1 and containing a non-residential use, no buffer shall be required. 
                  8.2.5 Buffer standards. Buffers should be sufficient to provide some screening or protection to neighboring uses, where required by the use and nature of the surrounding area. The particular standards for a specific buffer depend on the nature of the proposed use, and the character of the surrounding area. The zoning administrator shall make a determination as to the type of buffer required, following the procedure of section 8.2.6. 
                  (A)  The zoning administrator shall have the following discretionary options regarding the standards imposed on a particular buffer, and may impose some or all of the following requirements: 
                  (i)  Buffers may be required to be left in their natural state with the preexisting vegetation intact. 
                  (ii)  Buffers may be required to be planted or vegetated with fast growing trees and shrubs (for some or all of the width of the required buffer), in species and quantities to be determined by the zoning administrator. 
                  (iii)  Open field buffers may be left as open space. 
                  (iv)  Roads, right-of-way and streams may be counted towards buffer requirements, or may be left as open space. 
                  (v)  The zoning administrator may, in addition or in lieu of other requirements, require a fence be erected. 
                  (B)  Buffers shall be undisturbed, except that buffer areas may be used for sewer and other utility easements, detention ponds, access roads and fences may be erected in buffer areas. 
                  (C)  No structures may be erected in buffers, and buffers areas shall be graded or disturbed only when absolutely necessary. Buffers shall be crossed in such a fashion to minimize incursion into the buffer (i.e., close to perpendicularly). Where possible, buffers shall be restored to an opaque standard after being crossed, and BMPs, as required by the county development regulations (and Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance), shall be followed at all times. 
                  (D)  If a fence is required by the zoning administrator, it shall be eight feet high, wooden, stone or masonry, and shall be opaque. 
                  (E)  The zoning administrator shall have the authority to administratively vary all requirements in this section. 
                  (F)  The zoning administrator's determination may be appealed to the board of appeals. See article XIV. 
                  8.2.6 Procedure. In the event a development is one that requires buffers, the developer shall inform the zoning administrator of the proposed use, and provide information about the size of the operation, dimensions of the building(s), the planned hours of operation, security lighting and other lighting issues, anticipated traffic flow of customers, suppliers and deliveries, and any other information as required by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall review the surrounding area and the uses and zoning of surrounding property. The zoning administrator shall then determine the appropriate buffering standards under section 8.2.5, considering the following criteria: 
                  (A)  The nature of the use, and all the information provided about the use and its potential nuisance impact on the neighboring and surrounding properties; 
                  (B)  The existing and adjacent uses that may already impose similar negative impacts on adjoining property; 
                  (C)  The existing dissimilar uses of surrounding property and the current zoning of the surrounding property; 
                  (D)  The location of any nearby residences; and 
                  (E)  The existence of any streams, roads or other rights-of-way, the natural terrain and the existing topography, that may provide buffering. 
                  8.2.7 County property that is adjacent to municipal property shall have a buffer requirement for the common border equal to the buffer that would be required for the most similar or closest equivalent county zoning district, based on the underlying use, setback, and density criteria of the districts. This determination shall be made by the zoning administrator comparing the ordinances. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 8.3. - Reduction of buffers. 
                  8.3.1 Policy. Buffers are designed to protect adjacent properties from negative impacts of incompatible uses. Agreement by a current owner to reduce an adjacent buffer may create problems when future owners attempt different uses of the property. Therefore, permission to reduce buffers should be given only after careful review, and determination that no other property will be negatively impacted or lose any buffer protection. In addition, the reduction shall be recorded as a public record so that future purchasers are aware of the reduction. 
                  8.3.2 Procedure. Any adjacent property owner may request a buffer reduction (i.e., allowing an adjacent property owner to reduce the buffer protecting the applicant's property) by filing a request on forms provided by the zoning administrator. Reduction in any amount, down to zero feet, may be requested. 
                  8.3.3 Restrictions. No buffer reduction may result in the buffer zone being reduced to less than the required minimum distance for any portion of any property not participating in the request (i.e., a buffer could not be reduced for the full width of a property if an adjacent property would not have a full buffer from all points on the adjoining corner). The property burdened by the buffer cannot be the applicant to reduce its own buffer. This section cannot be used to reduce a buffer imposed by a zoning condition. 
                  8.3.4 Requirements. 
                  (A)  The properties involved must be adjacent to each other. 
                  (B)  All the then-current owners of the property desiring that the buffer be reduced (i.e. the property giving up the protection of buffer) must sign said request and have the signature(s) notarized. 
                  (C)  The applicant must provide the following along with the application: 
                  (1)  The deed of the property making application. 
                  (2)  One copy of a plat, drawn to scale, showing north arrow, land lot and district, the dimensions, acreage and location of the tract and showing the reduced or eliminated buffer area and buffers remaining to protect adjacent property not participating in the request. The plat should show the zoning of all the involved and adjoining parcels. The plat must be prepared by an architect, engineer, landscape architect or land surveyor whose state registration is current and valid. The preparer's seal shall be affixed to the plat. If a new plat is prepared, the plat must be prepared in compliance with the county's GPS Control Network and Digital Enterprise GIS system (consult the engineering department for details). An additional electronic copy of the plat shall be submitted by the applicant, owner or developer to the engineering department. 
                  (3)  The names and addresses of the owners of the land and their agents, if any. 
                  (4)  The names and addresses of all adjoining property owners. In determining the adjoining property owners, streams and road, street or railroad rights-of-way shall be disregarded. 
                  8.3.5 Approval. 
                  (A)  Once filed with the zoning administrator, the zoning administrator shall have 15 days to approve or deny the request or determine that the request is incomplete. 
                  (B)  In determining whether to approve the application, the zoning administrator shall consider 1) whether the application satisfies the requirements of this section, 2) whether it protects the adjoining property owners who are not participating in the request; 3) whether the reduction of the buffer would create a nuisance; 4) whether the reduction of the buffer serves the public health, safety and welfare; and 5) whether the reduction of the buffer serves the purposes of this zoning ordinance. Failure to satisfy any of these conditions will justify a denial. If the reduction of the buffer can be reasonably anticipated to create future nuisances, it may be denied. 
                  (C)  A denial may be appealed to the board of zoning appeals under subsection 14.4.1. 
                  8.3.6 Effect on property upon which buffer is waived or reduced. 
                  (A)  Once the adjoining property owner waives or reduces the buffer, it is waived or reduced hereafter unless both current adjoining property owners file a request for the buffer to be reinstated. 
                  (B)  If the request is approved, the applicant shall submit a proposed agreement, covenant or other instrument to the zoning administrator, for review and approval prior to filing in the office of the clerk of superior court, Bartow County, Georgia, in the deed records. The plat shall also be filed and referenced therein reflecting the buffer reduction. The purpose of this instrument shall be to inform all subsequent purchasers of the reduction of the buffer. The buffer reduction shall not take effect until said instrument has been reviewed and approved, and it and the plat have been recorded. 
                  (C)  A buffer that has been reduced or eliminated through this section may be increased or re-imposed by future zoning decision or zoning condition imposed by the commissioner, especially if conditions change. The reduction granted in this section by the zoning administrator shall not abridge the zoning power of the county's governing authority. However, any future zoning decision or zoning condition should respect the vested rights of the property owners.

                  Sec. 9.4. - Landfills and solid waste disposal facilities. 
                  9.4.1 Permitted landfills/disposal facilities are classified into three types: 1) inert waste landfills; 2) construction and demolition (C and D) landfills; and 3) municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. Each type of landfill is defined below. Inert waste landfills are permitted as of right in the M-1 district, and permitted as conditional uses in the A-1, I-1 and I-2 districts. C and D and MSW landfills are only permitted as conditional uses in the I-2 district. Landfills that are not permitted in any district include hazardous waste landfills. In the event a solid waste disposal facility is sought to be constructed that is not covered specifically herein, the zoning administrator shall make a determination as to what use it is most closely related to and apply the relevant regulations. This Section incorporates by reference the definitions contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-8-22 and DNR Rule 391-3-4-.01. 
                  Types of disposal facilities: 
                  (A)  "Inert waste landfill" means a disposal facility accepting only wastes that will not or are not likely to cause production of leachate of environmental concern. Such wastes are limited to earth and earth-like products, concrete, cured asphalt, rocks, bricks, yard trimmings, stumps, limbs, and leaves. This definition excludes industrial and demolition waste not specifically listed above. 
                  (B)  "Construction/demolition waste landfill" means a disposal facility accepting only waste building materials and rubble resulting from construction, remodeling, repair, and demolition operations on pavements, houses, commercial buildings and other structures. Such wastes include, but are not limited to, wood, bricks, metal, concrete, wall board, paper, cardboard, inert waste landfill material, and other nonputrescible wastes which have a low potential for groundwater contamination. 
                  (C)  "Municipal solid waste landfill" means any facility or location where the final deposition of any amount of municipal solid waste occurs, whether or not mixed with or including commercial or industrial solid waste, and includes, but is not limited to, municipal solid waste landfills and municipal solid waste thermal treatment technology facilities. "Municipal solid waste" means any solid waste derived from households, including garbage, trash, and sanitary waste in septic tanks and means solid waste from single-family and multifamily residences, hotels and motels, bunkhouses, campgrounds, picnic grounds, and day use recreation areas. The term includes yard trimmings, construction or demolition waste, and commercial solid waste but does not include solid waste from mining, agricultural, or silvicultural operations or industrial processes or operations. 
                  (D)  "Hazardous waste disposal facility." Hazardous waste landfills are prohibited, and hazardous waste (which means any solid waste which has been defined as hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the board of natural resources, chapter 391-3-11.) may not be disposed of in inert, construction/demolition, or solid waste landfills. 
                  9.4.2 Regulations applying to C and D and MSW landfills/disposal facilities. 
                  (A)  Any C and D or MSW landfill/disposal facility must be located on a minimum of 250 acres. The landfill "cell" area (that is, holding actual waste) may not exceed 30 percent of the total acreage, with landfill operations areas (i.e., "cells" plus scales, offices, storage, other buildings, etc.) not exceeding 40 percent. No landfill cell may exceed 60 feet in height from the original grade, when fully filled, covered and vegetated. No more than ten acres of the property can be active landfill cell at any one time. 
                  (B)  All landfill cell areas and landfill operations areas must be surrounded by a chain link fence at least six feet high and topped with anti-climbing devices. The boundary of the landfill property (either inside or outside the vegetated buffer) must be surrounded by a wooden privacy fence, at least eight feet high. 
                  (C)  All C and D and MSW landfills must be surrounded by a buffer at least 1,000 feet thick, located on the landfill property. The buffer must be sufficiently vegetated to be completely opaque and prevent viewing of any landfill cell at all times of the year. At least 500 feet of the buffer must be vegetated, even if plantings are required; the planting plan shall be approved by the zoning administrator. The buffer must also comply with all requirements and specifications of section 8.2.5 which do not conflict with these requirements. 
                  (D)  No landfill cell may be located within 2,000 feet of any residential dwelling (so used at the time of application for the permit). No landfill cell may be located within 250 feet of a wetland, groundwater recharge area, lake or other body of water, floodplain, stream or river. 
                  9.4.3 Regulations applying to inert landfills. 
                  (A)  Any inert landfill must be located on a minimum of 50 acres. The landfill "cell" area (actual waste disposal area) may not approach within 100 feet of the property line. No landfill cell may exceed 30 feet in height from the original grade, when fully filled, covered and vegetated. 
                  (B)  All landfill cell areas and landfill operations areas must be surrounded by a chain link fence at least six feet high and topped with anti-climbing devices. 
                  (C)  All inert landfills must be surrounded by a vegetated buffer at least 100 feet thick, located on the landfill property. The buffer must be sufficiently vegetated to be completely opaque and prevent viewing of any landfill cell at all times of the year. If plantings are required to meet this standard, the planting plan shall be approved by the zoning administrator. The buffer must also comply with all requirements and specifications of section 8.2.5 which do not conflict with these requirements. 
                  9.4.4 Regulations applying to all landfills and disposal facilities. 
                  (A)  All lights at landfill/disposal facilities shall be downward firing and shielded. Hours of operation of any landfill shall be no greater than 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday to Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Saturday. No operation allowed on Sunday. 
                  (B)  A landfill/disposal facility shall only be permitted where all county roads used for access have been built to a standard sufficient to withstand the projected number of trips per day at maximum weight for the vehicles expected. If a landfill is proposed adjacent to county roads that are not sufficient, according to the county engineer, to withstand the loads, or were not designed for such loads, the landfill owner may pay to bring such roads up to standard from the entrance(s) of the landfill to the nearest county or state road of sufficient strength; or the landfill shall be denied. Truck traffic shall be restricted to roads of sufficient strength. 
                  9.4.5 An application for a conditional use permit for a landfill shall also submit the following information, in addition to other conditional use requirements: 
                  (A)  A topographic site plan showing the proposed landfill, all surrounding uses in a ½-mile radius, the zoning on all adjacent parcels, the location of the landfill cells, all buffers and fences, highlighting land sloping 25 percent or more, and showing such other information as may be required by the zoning administrator. 
                  (B)  Proximity to airports, sailports, private airstrips and similar uses within ten miles shall be indicated. Proximity to national historic sites within five miles shall be indicated. 
                  (C)  A report from a geologist of the soil conditions on the landfill, discussing the topography (especially any steep slopes), the substrata, and any geologic hazards or relevant conditions on the property, as well as giving an opinion as to the property's suitability for the type of landfill proposed. 
                  (D)  A site plan prepared by a qualified engineer depicting all floodplains, streams and rivers, watershed areas, wetlands, and groundwater recharge areas within ½ mile of the subject property (including on the subject property), as well as showing the location of the landfill and the landfill cells to those features, showing all buffers and setbacks. The plan shall also depict all water wells within ½ mile of the landfill cells. 
                  (E)  A plan showing access, ingress and egress, including mechanisms to keep dust down and dirt off county roads. All access roads to landfill cells must be paved, and a truck cleaning station must be used at any exit. An estimate of daily truck traffic shall be provided, and entrances shall be located to minimize traffic hazards, with accel/decel lanes provided. 
                  (F)  A traffic plan showing ingress and egress, number of trips per day, vehicle type, and maximum weight of vehicles expected. 
                  (G)  A determination of plan consistency obtained under the county joint solid waste management plan showing that the landfill is consistent with the JSWMP. This should be obtained prior to seeking a conditional use permit.

                  9.5.2 "Recovered materials processing facility" means a facility engaged solely in the storage, processing, and resale or reuse of recovered materials; also known as a "recycling facility." Such definition shall not include a solid waste handling facility; provided, however, any solid waste generated by such facility shall be subject to all applicable laws and regulations relating to such solid waste. "Solid waste handling facility" means any facility (including a composting facility), the primary purpose of which is the storage, collection, transportation, treatment, utilization, processing, or disposal, or any combination thereof, of solid waste. "Recovered materials" means those materials which have known use, reuse, or recycling potential; can be feasibly used, reused or recycled; and have been diverted or removed from the solid waste stream for sale, use, reuse, or recycling, whether or not requiring subsequent separation and processing. "Recycling" means any process by which materials which would otherwise become solid waste are collected, separated, or processed and reused or returned to use in the form of raw materials or products. 
                  9.5.3 Any facility must be located on a minimum of 250 acres. The active waste handling area (that is, an area for handling, storing, collecting, processing, treating, etc. waste) may not exceed 40 percent of that acreage. 
                  9.5.4 The boundary of the facility property (either inside or outside the vegetated buffer) must be surrounded by a wooden privacy fence, at least eight feet high. Any active waste handling area must be surrounded by a chain-link fence at least six feet high and topped with anti-climbing devices. 
                  9.5.5 All facilities must be surrounded by a vegetated buffer at least 1,000 feet thick, located on the property. The buffer must be sufficiently vegetated to be completely opaque and prevent viewing of any waste handling area at all times of the year. At least 500 feet of the buffer must be vegetated, even if plantings are required; the planting plan shall be approved by the zoning administrator. The buffer must also comply with all requirements and specifications of section 8.2.5 which do not conflict with these requirements. 
                  9.5.6 No waste handling area (as measured from the chain link fence boundary) may be located within 2,000 feet of any residential dwelling (so used at the time of the application). Waste handling areas may not be located within 250 feet of a wetland, groundwater recharge area, lake or other body of water, floodplain, stream or river. 
                  9.5.7 All lights at a facility shall be downward firing and shielded. Hours of operation of any facility shall be no greater than 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday to Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Saturday. No operation allowed on Sunday.

                  11.2.1 Permits and registration. 
                  (A)  Sign registration. No permit is required from the zoning administrator prior to erection of a sign. However, all parties are advised to consult with the zoning administrator to avoid erecting signs that violate this ordinance, and it is suggested that a sign registration be filed prior to construction to ensure the sign is in compliance with the ordinance. Zoning registration and compliance with this ordinance does not constitute full approval of a sign. Approval from other departments or agencies may be required for a sign to be lawful. (See paragraphs B and C, below). Sign registration is required for signs in the O/I, C-N, C-1, I-1, I-2, M-1 or commercial areas of PUD districts. Sign registration is not required for signs in A-1, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, RE-1 or RE-2 districts, or residential lots in PUD districts. 
                  (B)  Building permits. Signs using electrical wiring and connections (i.e. illuminated signs) may require a building permit, and the county building official should be contacted regarding such signs. However, issuance of a building permit should not be considered the only approval necessary to erect a sign; approvals from other departments or state agencies may be required (see paragraph C, below). 
                  (C)  Other permits or approvals. Other county ordinances (e.g., county development regulations) or state laws and regulations (e.g., MUTCD, DOT regulations) may be applicable to a sign. A party seeking to erect a sign should consult with the department of transportation (if on state road), the county engineering department, and the county road department prior to construction of a new sign to ensure that all applicable regulations are observed. 
                  (D)  Time for sign registration. Within 60 days of the erection of any permanent sign in the O/I, C-N, C-1, I-1, I-2, M-1 or commercial areas of PUD zoning districts, the sign or property owner is required to file a registration form regarding the sign. Sign registration is not required for signs in A-1, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, RE-1 or RE-2 districts or for signs on residential lots in PUD districts. 
                  (E)  Information required. The sign registration shall be on forms provided by the zoning administrator, and shall provide the following information, as well as any additional information required by the zoning administrator: 
                  (i)  the name and address of the property owner and sign owner, if different; 
                  (ii)  the address of the sign, and description of the parcel upon which the sign is located;

                  (v)  elevation drawing showing the height and dimensions of sign face, and height of sign structure; 
                  (vi)  square foot area per sign face and the aggregate square foot area if there is more than one sign face; and 
                  (vii)  the registration must be signed by either the property owner or sign owner. 
                  11.2.2 Enforcement. The county reserves the right to take legal action to remove signs erected in violation of this ordinance. Failure to file a sign registration in a timely fashion shall be a violation of this ordinance.

                  11.4.4 Internal signs. Any sign not visible from the outside of a structure or to passing members of the public is not restricted or regulated by this ordinance. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 11.5. - Regulations for signs. 
                  11.5.1 Location and set back. 
                  (A)  The property owner must give permission for all sign placement on the owner's property. Signs are not permitted in county road right-of-way without permission of the county road department director. 
                  (B)  All signs must comply with all side and rear set backss of the underlying zoning ordinance. 
                  (C)  Signs can be located in front setback areas, but all signs and sign structures, except as noted below, must be set back at least five feet from the road right-of-way. No portion of a sign or sign structure erected on private property shall encroach on or overhang the public right-of-way or any other person's property. Furthermore, for safety reasons, no sign erected on private property shall be located closer than ten feet from the back of the curb of a public roadway, or if there is no curb, from the edge of the pavement. See also section 11.6.3 and 11.6.4. The engineering department and road department must review and approve placement of signs located within 20 feet of the right-of-way for compliance with the manual on uniform traffic control devices, latest edition (MUTCD) and applicable county ordinances. 
                  (D)  Entrance signs must be set back from the right-of-way a distance equal to their height plus one foot for sight distance requirements, and must comply with any applicable provision in the MUTCD. The engineering department and road department must review and approve placement of entrance signs for compliance with MUTCD and applicable county ordinances. 
                  (E)  No sign on private property can be erected closer than 50 feet to the right-of-way of interstate highway 75. 
                  (F)  Distances are measured from the closest portion of the sign (whether that be the base, sign face, or the sign structure) to the right-of-way, curb or pavement. 
                  11.5.2 Height limits. Height limitations in this ordinance control over the general height limitations of this ordinance, and apply to any structure that contains a sign. For example, a church spire or radio antenna with a sign would be subject to the height limitations of this ordinance, rather than general height limitations. Height limitations apply to both the sign and the sign structure, whichever is the tallest. 
                  11.5.3 Number. For the purpose of determining the number of signs, ground signs shall be equal to the number of sign structures. All other non-ground signs shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device containing elements organized, related and composed to form a unit. Where matter is displayed in random manner without organized relationship of elements, such elements shall be considered to be a single sign. 
                  11.5.4 Illumination. 
                  (A)  Ground signs cannot be internally illuminated in any residential or agricultural zoning district. All signs may be externally illuminated. External illumination of any sign in any district shall be positioned and shielded so that the light source cannot be seen directly by any passing motorists nor from adjacent dwellings or businesses. 
                  (B)  Flashing, blinking or otherwise varying illumination is not permitted, except as specified below. No external or internal illumination that causes confusion with or distraction from any traffic signal or safety device shall be permitted. L.E.D. signs, LCD signs, digital signs, "TV" type signs, or similar signs with changing images or displaying moving pictures (collectively referred to as "electronic variable message center (EVMC) signs") are not permitted, except under the special exception in paragraph (F) below. 
                  (C)  All externally illuminated signs shall utilize low wattage luminaries, mounted in fixtures designed to direct the light and eliminate light trespass, such as light shining into residences or other neighboring structures. 
                  (D)  All internally illuminated signs shall utilize low wattage luminaries designed to reduce light glow. 
                  (E)  All signs over ten feet in height shall be internally illuminated or illuminated by external lighting fixtures located above the sign area, firing downward, and not visible to passing motorists. 
                  (F)  EVMC sign exception. Limited EVMC signage (as defined in paragraph (B) above) is allowed in the C-1, C-N, I-1, I-2 and BPD district as follows. No more than 70 square feet of any ground sign face area may be used as an EVMC sign. The sign may be two-faced, with 70 square feet of EVMC sign per face. This amount is not in addition to sign face limits, but rather subtracts from the limits. Example: if a C-1 lot is permitted to have a single ground sign with 100 square feet per sign face on a double-sided sign, 70 square feet of the 100 square feet may be converted to EVMC, and the remaining 30 be kept conventional sign, for each side (provided the other requirements herein are obeyed). No more than one ground sign on any lot may contain an EVMC. 
                  (G)  Electronic illumination standards. No EVMC nor other electronic sign may change message more than once per ten seconds. "Motion picture" type images (multiple frames per second) are not permitted. Electronic displays shall be equipped with automatic dimming technology which adjusts the sign's illumination level based on ambient light conditions. The maximum illumination level of an electronic display shall be 0.3 foot candles above ambient light levels, to be measured as follows: at least 30 minutes past sunset, and with the electronic display either turned off, showing all black copy, or blocked, a foot candle meter will be used to record the area ambient light level. An ambient reading will be taken with the meter aimed directly at the electronic display and at the following distance: 

                   
                  To establish the illumination level, the electronic display will be turned on to show all white copy and a second reading taken. The difference between the two readings shall be the electronic sign's illumination level. In no event shall daylight illumination levels exceed 7,500 nits nor nighttime exceed 250 nits. 
                  11.5.5 Calculation of area. The area of a sign is calculated by determining the area of the sign face, and shall be determined by the zoning administrator. Signs of unusual shape, design, or supporting elements may have their area calculated by calculating the area of the smallest rectangle that will completely enclose all elements of the sign face and sign structure supporting the face. Parties seeking to erect an unconventional sign should check with the zoning administrator for compliance issues. 
                  11.5.6 Projecting signs. Any sign with an element that would project more than five feet outside the main body of the sign area, in any direction, requires an administrative variance from the zoning administrator. A sign that is attached at an angle to the wall may extend outward no more than five feet, and requires an administrative variance from the zoning administrator. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ; Ord. of 9-19-2018(4) , §§ II, III) 
                  Sec. 11.6. - Safety and construction standards. 
                  11.6.1 Official confusion. Signs which contain or are in imitation of an official traffic sign or signal, or can be confused with an official traffic sign, are prohibited. 
                  11.6.2 Fire safety. No sign or sign structure may be erected or maintained which obstructs any fire escape, ventilation, or door; nor shall any sign or sign structure be attached to a fire escape. 
                  11.6.3 Corner visibility. No sign or sign structure above a height of three feet shall be maintained within 15 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two streets, or of a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way. 
                  11.6.4 Traffic visibility and safety. No sign shall obstruct the traffic sight line, or the view of vehicles entering the roadway (i.e., the view of oncoming traffic by vehicles attempting to enter the road, or vice versa). No sign shall be erected on any traffic island. No sign shall create a traffic hazard. Sign locations shall be approved by the road department if a safety question is raised by the zoning administrator. 
                  11.6.5 Good repair. All signs, together with all their supports, braces, guys, and anchors shall be kept in good repair. 
                  11.6.6 Temporary sign standards. All temporary signs shall be made of waterproof material, and must be attached to an independent mounting device no more than 40 inches above ground level. The mounting must be secure to prevent the sign from blowing off the device. The mounting device shall bear the name and phone number of the party responsible for the device. 
                  11.6.7 Removal of unsafe signs and safety hazards. The county may remove a sign in violation of this ordinance, without giving notice to any party, if said sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property; or said sign poses an immediate safety threat to the life or health of any members of the public. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 11.7. - Prohibited signs. 
                  The following types of signs are prohibited, as stated: 
                  11.7.1 Roof signs (which means signs mounted above a roof or projecting above the roof-line of a structure). 
                  11.7.2 Rotating signs. 
                  11.7.3 Portable signs (which means signs which are attached to vehicles, trailers, movable structures, or attached to sign structures which are not permanently anchored into the ground, or any sign which may be transported or is designed to be transported). Such signs include, but are not limited to, printed banners or billboards attached to vehicles and trailers. Inflatable figures and objects (e.g., creatures, beer cans) fall into this category. 
                  11.7.4 Swinging or projecting signs, unless an administrative variance is granted by the zoning administrator. No such sign can project more than five feet, and in no case shall this type of sign exceed ten square feet in sign area. See section 11.5.6. 
                  11.7.5 Mechanical signs, or signs with moving parts. This includes signs with mechanized or moving elements; "trivision"-type signs; signs with waiving elements, whether motorized or wind-powered; "multiple message signs" as defined in O.C.G.A. § 32-6-71; or similar moving signs. However, signs that do not move or change more than six times per day are permitted. 
                  11.7.6 Signs with flashing or blinking lights. This includes, but is not limited to, signs of varying light intensity, and signs containing exposed neon tubing. Signs with reflective elements that sparkle in the sunlight or that contain luminous paint that glows in the dark are not allowed. 
                  11.7.7 LED and electronic signs. This includes, but is not limited to, signs displaying moving pictures, images or animation; LED (light emitting diode) signs; LCD (liquid crystal display) signs; digital signs; "TV" type signs; EVMC (electronic variable message center) signs; signs that spell words or create images with numerous small lights or other internal illumination; and similar electronic or digital signs. A limited exception to this prohibition is permitted under section 11.5.4 above. Externally illuminated, electronically controlled, segmented sign display elements are not prohibited. 
                  11.7.8 Courtesy benches, trash cans, and similar devices displaying signs. 
                  11.7.9 Trailer signs (which means signs mounted on trailers, exceeding two square feet). 
                  11.7.10 Sidewalk, A-type, sandwich or curb-type signs placed on sidewalks. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 11.8. - Purposes; intent; studies considered; cases considered. 
                  11.8.1 Purposes. It is the purpose of the county in enacting article XI to provide standards to safeguard life, public health, property and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, erection, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs. More specifically, signs have a powerful impact on the aesthetic environment of the community, and it is the purpose of this ordinance to encourage an aesthetically attractive environment, allowing sufficient opportunities for communications to serve business, interest groups and the public, while complying with the federal and state constitutions and laws. Signs create visual clutter and therefore should be regulated in their size, location, construction and illumination. Signs can detract from the beauty of the neighborhood and lower property values. In seeking to comply with federal and state law, the county has determined the following: large signs are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, an aesthetic harm; the Georgia Supreme Court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of environment; and, the Eleventh Circuit has recognized portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard. These holdings show that the county's ordinance is within the law and constitutional, which is a goal of the county. The goal of this ordinance is to avoid being an impermissible content-based regulation, and instead to be a permissible time, place and manner restriction. 
                  Many signs can also be a hazard and negatively impact traffic safety, by distracting drivers and blocking views of other vehicles and dangers, by making intersections more treacherous, and by making it difficult to see oncoming traffic when entering a roadway. The county finds that especially distracting to drivers are moving signs, digital signs and electronic signs that resemble televisions or computer screens. Therefore, it is also the purpose of this ordinance to prevent those harms by regulating signs to safe locations, safe sizes, with proper and safe illumination and construction, or to prohibit signs that are too distracting. 
                  Finally, it is the belief of the county that more communication is desirable during the election cycle, so that all citizens may freely express their viewpoints during the election campaigns, and therefore the ordinance allows increased opportunities to erect signs during these periods, without limiting content or favoring content in any fashion. At all times, any sign permitted under this regulation can carry any message, political or non-political, commercial or non-commercial. 
                  11.8.2 Intent. In adopting article XI, it is the intent of the county to: 
                  (A)  Balance the right of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; and 
                  (B)  Further the objectives of the county's future land use map and sound planning principles and objectives; and 
                  (C)  Protect the public health, safety and welfare; and 
                  (D)  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; and 
                  (E)  Maintain the historical and cultural heritage and image of the county; and 
                  (F)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; and 
                  (G)  Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs; and 
                  (H)  Promote economic development and tourism; and 
                  (I)  Protect private property values; and 
                  (J)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
                  11.8.3 Studies considered. Having considered the following studies, which the county commissioner finds to be relevant, useful and applicable to the county, the county finds that the size, location and quantity of sign structures within the county must be regulated in order to achieve the above-stated intents and purposes:

                  Such studies, which were considered by the commissioner prior to adoption of this provision, are part of the official record of the adoption of this ordinance. 
                  11.8.4 Cases considered. In adopting these sign regulations, the county commissioner especially recognizes the vast number of court decisions, coming from state courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the above-stated intents and purposes, and that such intents and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests, which include the following: 
                  Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., 193 Fed.Appx. 900 (C.A.11 th 2006)(finding that the stated goals within a sign ordinance of protecting against traffic hazards and the adverse impact on the county's aesthetic qualities are substantial government interests); Gregory v. Clive, 2007 WL 2914515 (Ga. S.Ct. 2007)(recognizing as within a local government's police power to enact legislation governing billboards and signs, as such legislation clearly addresses the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community); H and H Operations, Inc. v. City of Peachtree City, Ga., 248 Ga. 500 (1981)(holding that, under its police power, a municipality can enact and enforce reasonable regulations governing the erection and maintenance of signs within its jurisdiction); Harnish v. Manatee County, Florida, 783 F.2d 1535 (C.A. 11 th 1986)(finding that aesthetics is a substantial governmental goal which is entitled to and should be accorded weighty respect, and that the governmental entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment must be given discretion in determining how much protection is necessary and the best method of achieving that protection); Lamar Advertising Company v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 254 F.Supp.2d 1321 (N.D.Ga. 2003)(finding that where a sign ordinance asserts the goals of public safety, traffic safety, health, welfare and aesthetics, a municipality has shown an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech); Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981)(holding that the goals of traffic safety and aesthetics advanced by a municipality as justification for regulating signs is a substantial governmental interest); St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269 (1919)(finding that billboards may be prohibited in the residential districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community); Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984)(finding that a government entity can regulate signs and billboards when necessary to advance a significant and legitimate state interest, such as the protection of the aesthetics and quality of life within its jurisdiction); City of Doraville v. Turner Communications, Corp., 236 Ga. 385 (1976)(finding that under its police power authority, a municipality can regulate the location and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within their territorial jurisdiction); Spratlin Outdoor Media, Inc. v. City of Douglasville, 2006 WL 826077 (N.D.Ga. 2006)(upholding sign ordinance where the ordinance's height and setback restrictions were rationally related to its stated goals of promoting the health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, promoting the orderly and beneficial development of the city, promoting adequate access to natural light and air, improving the aesthetic appearance of the city, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan). 
                  Such cases, which were considered by the commissioner prior to adoption of this provision, are part of the official record of the adoption of this ordinance. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  ARTICLE XII. - TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND ANTENNAS. 

                  Sec. 12.1. - Purposes. 
                  The purpose of this ordinance is to provide zoning classification requirements for the siting of all wireless, cellular, television and radio telecommunications towers and antennas; to encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas; to minimize the total number of towers within the community necessary to provide adequate personal wireless services to residents of the county; to encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites among service providers; to locate telecommunications towers and antennas in areas where adverse impacts on the community are minimized; to encourage the design and construction of towers and antennas to minimize adverse visual impacts; and to enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to deliver such services to the community effectively and efficiently. 
                  Sec. 12.2. - Definitions. 
                  For the purpose of this ordinance, certain terms used herein shall be defined as follows. The general definitions and interpretative rules of the zoning ordinance shall also be used. To the extent those general rules or definitions conflict with these specific definitions, these definitions shall control. 
                  Alternative tower structure: Clock towers, bell towers, church steeples, light/power poles, electric transmission towers, on premises signs, outdoor advertising signs, water storage tanks, and similar natural or man-made alternative-design mounting structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers. 
                  Antenna: Any exterior apparatus designed for wireless telecommunication, radio, or television communications through the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves. 
                  Co-location: The placement of the antennas of two or more service providers upon a single tower or alternative tower structure. 
                  Department: The county planning, zoning and development department. 
                  FAA: The Federal Aviation Administration. 
                  FCC: The Federal Communications Commission. 
                  Geographic antenna placement area: The general vicinity within which the placement of an antenna is necessary to meet the engineering requirements of an applicant's cellular network or other broadcasting need. 
                  Height: When referring to a tower or other structure, "height" means the distance measured from ground level to the highest point on the tower structure or appurtenance. 
                  Preexisting tower and antennas: Structures as set forth in section 12.3.4 of this ordinance. 
                  Scenic views: Those geographic areas containing visually significant or unique natural features, as identified in the county comprehensive plan. 
                  Tower: Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telecommunication towers, man-made trees (with accessory buildings/structures) and other similar structures. 
                  Visual quality: The appropriate design, arrangement and location of tower structures in relation to the built or natural environment to avoid abrupt or severe differences. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 12.3. - Applicability. 
                  12.3.1 General application. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions, requirements and limitations of this ordinance shall govern the location of all wireless telecommunication, cellular telecommunication, television, microwave or radio transmission tower or antenna installed within unincorporated Bartow County. In the event of any conflict between any other provision of the zoning ordinance and this ordinance, this ordinance shall control. 
                  12.3.2 Governmental exemption. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this ordinance, the provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to the county's properties, facilities or structures. Private facilities and structures placed upon county property shall be governed by a lease agreement between the county and the provider. 
                  12.3.3 Amateur radio; receive-only antennas. This ordinance shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is 75 feet or less in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator from the operator's residence, or is used exclusively as a receive-only antenna; provided, however, only one such tower or antenna per residence shall be excluded from this ordinance. 
                  12.3.4 Pre-existing towers and antennas. Towers and antennas permitted and erected as of September 7, 2001 shall be deemed pre-existing, and shall not be subject to the requirements of this ordinance. The placement of additional antennas on any nonconforming structure shall not create a vested right for the continued use of the structures should the nonconforming use cease. If an additional antenna is co-located on a preexisting tower after September 7, 2001, the requirement of this ordinance shall be met. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 12.4. - General provisions. 
                  12.4.1 Conditional use required. A conditional use permit shall be required for the placement of any tower or alternative tower structure, except as otherwise permitted herein. Procedures for conditional use permits sought under this ordinance are contained in section 12.5. 
                  12.4.2 Principal or accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structures. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including but not limited to set-back, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use of structure. 
                  12.4.3 Co-location of antennas required. Applicants for the erection of a tower or antenna, except amateur radio operators, shall be required to co-locate upon an existing tower structure, if possible. An exception to co-location shall only be made if the applicant submits a report from an engineer demonstrating that an existing tower suitable for co-location does not exist in the geographic antenna placement area, and that no suitable alternative tower structure is available, or if the applicant submits an affidavit from an employee that while a suitable tower may exist, no space is available thereon. Co-location is permissible provided the new antenna will add no more than ten feet to the height of the tower and related equipment or appurtenances. Increasing the antenna height more than ten feet requires a conditional use permit. Co-location requires only a building permit, and the information described in section 12.7.2. 
                  12.4.4 Variances. The county may grant variances from the strict enforcement of this ordinance where it finds that a substantial justification exists, where the goals of this ordinance can be met without strict compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and where such variance will not unduly prejudice any other property. 
                  12.4.5 Time limits. Except where delay is caused by the applicant, the county shall make a final decision on applications for a conditional use permit for a new tower within 150 days of the filing of a complete application; the County shall make a final decision on co-location requests within 90 days of the filing of a complete application. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 12.5. - Conditional use permit required. 
                  12.5.1 General. 
                  (A)  A conditional use permit shall be required for the construction of a tower in any zoning district. All such uses shall comply with requirements set forth in this ordinance and all other applicable codes and ordinances, unless the applicant can show that the denial of a permit in such a location will cause a significantly harmful and permanent degradation of service which cannot be overcome by any other means including planned or potential locations which would provide the same or similar coverage or capacity. 
                  (B)  In granting a conditional use permit, the county may impose conditions to the extent that it concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize adverse effects from the proposed tower on adjoining or nearby properties as set out in section 12.5.6. 
                  12.5.2 Application; contents; fee. All applications for conditional use permits shall be submitted to the county planning, zoning and development department. Each application shall contain as a part thereof detailed plans and specifications as set forth in section 12.7. An application for a conditional use permit shall not be accepted for processing without the information required in section 12.7. An application fee shall be charged by the department in the amount stated in section 12.8. 
                  12.5.3 Independent expert review. The county may engage a licensed professional engineer as an independent expert to review any of the materials submitted by an applicant for a conditional use permit and render an opinion regarding any concerns about the proposal, including but not limited to, structural integrity and the feasibility of alternative sites or co-location. Following the review of an independent expert, the county shall convey its concerns to the applicant in writing and shall allow the applicant a reasonable opportunity to address those concerns. If the applicant is unable to satisfactorily address those concerns, the applicant shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days, following the receipt of the letter, in which to modify the application to alleviate the county's concerns or withdraw the application altogether. The expert's opinion shall be considered determinative, unless the applicant agrees to pay the expenses of submitting both opinions for a peer review, which review shall then be considered final. If the independent third-party expert supports the applicant's expert, then the department shall pay the expenses of said third-party expert. If the independent third-party expert supports the position of the department, then the applicant shall pay the expenses of said third-party expert. 
                  12.5.4 Public hearing. Before taking action upon the proposed conditional use permit, the county shall hold a public hearing on the matter. At least 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing, the county shall cause the following notice requirements to be instituted by the department: 
                  (A)  A sign shall be erected, in a conspicuous location, on or adjacent to the property under consideration. The sign shall state the time, place, location, and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  (B)  A letter shall be sent by first class mail, with proof of mailing obtained from the post office, to all property owners of record of abutting parcels, and to all property owners of residentially-used parcels lying in whole or in part within a distance of two times the height of the proposed tower as measured from its base, giving notice of the public hearing. The letter shall state the same information as required for the sign. Proof of mailing means either a "certification of mailing" or a "certified mail" receipt; a "return receipt" showing delivery is not required. Only owners reflected on the records of the tax assessors as of the date of the application shall be entitled to notice. The letter shall be mailed at least 15 days before the hearing. Proof of mailing shall be filed with the zoning administrator prior to any hearing. 
                  (C)  A public notice shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements appear once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the date of the hearing. 
                  (D)  Subsections (B) and (C) above shall be the responsibility of, and at the expense of, the applicant. Failing to comply with the requirements shall render the application out-of-order, and it shall be tabled for one month. If the application is still out-of-order at the next meeting, it shall be considered withdrawn, and the applicant shall have to wait six months to reapply. 
                  12.5.5 Considerations in approval or denial of conditional use permits. Any denial of a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications facility shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. The following factors may be taken into consideration in acting upon a conditional use permit application under the provisions of this ordinance: 
                  (A)  The height and setbacks of the proposed tower or antenna(s); 
                  (B)  The proximity of the tower or antenna(s) to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
                  (C)  The nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (D)  The surrounding topography; 
                  (E)  The surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
                  (F)  The design of the tower or antenna(s), with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
                  (G)  The proposed ingress and egress; 
                  (H)  The availability of suitable existing towers or other structures for antenna co-location; 
                  (I)  The impact of the proposed tower or antenna(s) upon scenic views and visual quality of the surrounding area; 
                  (J)  The needs of the applicant as balanced against the detrimental effects on surrounding properties; and 
                  (K)  The impact of the proposed tower or antenna(s) on adjacent and nearby properties. 
                  12.5.6 Requirements for issuance of conditional use permit. The conditional use permit may be issued by the county only upon satisfaction of the following requirements: 
                  (A)  A proper application filed in accordance with the requirements of section 12.7; 
                  (B)  The application is otherwise in compliance with or otherwise is satisfactory in considering the standards contained in section 12.5.5; 
                  (C)  The applicant complies with the conditions proposed by the county for the purpose of reducing the harmful effects of the use on surrounding uses and ensuring compatibility with surrounding uses; 
                  (D)  The county determines that the benefits and need for the proposed conditional use are greater than any possible depreciating effects or damages to neighboring or nearby properties; and 
                  (E)  All fees, including expert fees, have been paid in full. 
                  12.5.7 Resubmittal of conditional use application. An application for a conditional use permit which has been denied shall not be resubmitted for a period of 12 months and then only if the applicant can document a substantial change in need for a tower or antenna at the same location. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 12.6. - General requirements for towers. 
                  12.6.1 Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers. 
                  (A)  Towers shall be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from its base to any public right-of-way or occupied structure, or property line of the lot or parcel containing the tower, except when a property owner or adjoining property owner consents in writing to waive the setback and the applicant clearly demonstrates that the tower will collapse within the parent parcel. 
                  (B)  Guy-wires and accessory buildings and facilities shall meet the minimum accessory use location and setback requirements. 
                  (C)  In zoning districts other than I-2 and M-1, towers shall not be located closer than 500 feet from any existing tower. This requirement shall not apply to amateur radio towers. 
                  (D)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, no tower or antenna shall be permitted in a residential neighborhood or within 1,000 feet of any residential dwelling unless the applicant can show that the denial of a permit in such a location will cause a significantly harmful and permanent degradation of service which cannot be overcome by any other means including planned or potential locations which would provide the same or similar coverage or capacity. 
                  (E)  The requirement of section 12.6.1(D) (above) may be waived by the adjacent property owner(s). In such cases, the applicant shall submit a notarized affidavit from the adjacent owner(s), identifying the property owned, and affirming that he or she agrees that the tower can be erected at the proposed location, which shall be specifically described, including its distance from that owner's residential dwelling. The affidavit shall further specifically state that the affiant understands that he or she is waiving his or her rights under section 12.6.1 of the Bartow County Zoning Ordinance. Waivers shall be required of all property owners whose dwellings are located within 1,000 feet of the proposed tower. 
                  12.6.2 Aesthetics. The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the design and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this ordinance and shall be approved by the administrator. 
                  (A)  Towers and/or antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (B)  At all tower sites, the design of all buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment. Any equipment or cabinet that supports telecommunication facilities must be concealed from public view and made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
                  (C)  For antennas installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical ground equipment shall be of a neutral color so as to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive. 
                  (D)  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the county may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. The lighting shall be dimmed or changed to red lights from the sunset to sunrise. 
                  (E)  No signage or other identifying markings of a commercial nature shall be permitted upon any tower or alternative tower structure within the county. 
                  (F)  To the extent practical, telecommunication facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  (G)  Access to the tower site shall be restricted so as to minimize visibility of the access. Where possible, existing roads shall be used. Where no roads exist, access shall follow the existing contours of the land. 
                  (H)  Such other additional requirements as the administrator shall reasonably require to minimize the visual impact of the site on the surrounding area. 
                  12.6.3 Security fencing/anti-climbing devices. All towers and supporting equipment shall be enclosed by fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices. Fencing shall be of chain link, wood or other approved alternative. 
                  12.6.4 Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern landscaping surrounding all towers. 
                  (A)  Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. 
                  (B)  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  (C)  Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the administrator to assure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance. 
                  (D)  Amateur radio towers and antennas, or receive-only antennas shall not be subject to the provision of this section unless required by the county through the conditional use permit process. 
                  12.6.5 Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street, utilizing existing access to the property on which such facility is to be located, where possible. 
                  12.6.6 Review of tower and antenna erection by the airport authority. If, upon receipt of an application for the erection of any tower or alternative tower structure governed by this ordinance, the department deems that the proposed structure may interfere with or affect the use of the airways of the county by the public or interfere with or affect the operation of existing or proposed airport facilities, a copy of the application shall be submitted by the department to the Cartersville-Bartow County Airport Authority for review and recommendation. 
                  12.6.7 Federal requirements; removal of towers. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the permittee or the lessee of the tower and antenna governed by this ordinance shall bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall be deemed to be a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's, permittee's, or lessee's expense. Any such removal by the county shall be in the manner provided in the Bartow County Unfit Property Ordinance then in effect. 
                  12.6.8 Building codes; safety standards; removal of towers. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable standard building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the electronic industries association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the department concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, said party shall have 15 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within 15 days shall be deemed a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for removal of the tower as provided in the Bartow County Unfit Property Ordinance. Prior to the removal of any tower, the department may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above-referenced compliance period. Abandoned towers or towers deemed unsafe may also be removed under the Bartow County Unfit Property Ordinance procedures. 
                  12.6.9 Change of ownership notification. Upon the transfer of ownership of an interest in any tower, alternative tower structure, or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the department of the transaction in writing within 30 days.

                  (B)  A stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency or other exigent circumstances exist, no written notice shall be required, and a verbal stop work order may be issued, with a written order to be provided within three working days. 
                  (C)  Stop work orders may be issued on their own, or in conjunction with criminal citations, or civil proceedings in superior court.

                  Sec. 14.1. - Administrative variances. 
                  If in the judgment of the zoning administrator, the application of any particular numeric criteria, standard or requirement of this ordinance causes undue hardship on the applicant, the zoning administrator shall be empowered to grant an administrative variance to alter said requirement by up to 20 percent, if in doing so, the purposes of the ordinance are not impaired, and there is not a negative impact on the surrounding uses, properties, or neighbors. In granting an administrative variance, the zoning administrator may attach such conditions as the zoning administrator may deem advisable so that the purpose of this ordinance will be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. The zoning administrator shall not be authorized to grant a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited. An administrative variance shall be granted or denied in writing. Notice of the grant of an administrative variance shall be sent to all adjoining property owners via first class mail by the applicant. The notice shall describe the variance granted and state that interested parties have 30 days in which to file an appeal of the variance. Only owners reflected on the records of the tax assessors as of the date of the application shall be entitled to notice. Proof of mailing, as described in section 14.5.3, shall be submitted to the zoning department within ten days of grant of the variance. The 30 days shall be counted from the date of mailing of the notice.

                  Sec. 14.2. - Establishment of board of appeals. 
                  14.2.1 The board of zoning appeals, also referred to as the board of appeals, was established by previous version of this ordinance, and remains authorized under this ordinance. Existing board members shall continue in their current terms unaffected by the adoption of this ordinance. The board consists of five members appointed by the county commissioner for staggered terms of three years. Each successive appointment shall be for three years. 
                  14.2.2 Members shall be paid per meeting at a rate established by the commissioner and may be reimbursed for any expenses incurred while representing the board. Any vacancy in the membership of the board of appeals shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the initial appointment. Members shall be removable for cause by the county commissioner upon written charges and after public hearing. The board of appeals previously appointed under the authority of the prior zoning ordinance shall continue without change as if appointed under this ordinance.

                  Sec. 14.3. - Proceedings of the board of appeals. 
                  14.3.1 The board of appeals shall elect a chair-person and a vice chair-person from its members who shall serve for three years or until re-elected or until their successors are elected.

                  14.3.2 Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chair-person and at such other times as the board may determine. The chair-person, or in his absence, the vice chair-person, may administer oaths to witnesses. 
                  14.3.3 The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and may be a public record. 
                  14.3.4 All meetings of the board of appeals shall be open to the public. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 14.4. - Powers and duties of the board of appeals. 
                  The board of appeals shall have the following powers and duties: 
                  14.4.1 Appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement of this ordinance. Appeals to the board of appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the county affected by any decision of the zoning administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days of said decision by filing with the zoning administrator a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. Decisions on appeals shall be issued in writing within ten days of the appeal. 
                  14.4.2 Variances. The board of appeals has the power to hear requests for variances from the provisions of this ordinance. Variance may be granted only if the board finds all of the following to exist: 
                  (A)  That one of the following is true, through no action or fault of the property owner or predecessor: 
                  (i)  The property is exceptionally narrow, shallow or unusually shaped, 
                  (ii)  The property contains exceptional topographic conditions, 
                  (iii)  The property contains other extraordinary or exceptional conditions, or 
                  (iv)  There are existing other extraordinary or exceptional circumstances; and 
                  (B)  That the strict application of the requirements of this ordinance would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the owner of this property; and 
                  (C)  That the requested variance relief may be granted without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this ordinance. 
                  Variance decisions shall be issued in writing within ten days of the hearing. 
                  14.4.3 Conditions. In granting a variance, the board of appeals may attach such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable so that the purpose of this ordinance will be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. 
                  14.4.4 Limitations on variances; improper variance requests. 
                  (A)  Variances cannot be given to totally remove a requirement or to exempt a property or applicant entirely from a requirement. If a variance is being sought that is, in the judgment of the zoning administrator, a request that would constitute a text amendment, then the application shall not be accepted. For example, a request to be exempted from the Etowah Valley historic district requirements would not be the subject of a variance. The applicant shall instead be directed to file for a text amendment. Variances can only be given to alter a numeric value, such as a setback, height limit, area limit, and so forth. 
                  (B)  The board of appeals shall not be authorized to grant a density variance or a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance seeks something that cannot be varied. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance is contradictory to the ordinance (such as reducing a requirement to zero or totally eliminating a requirement). A variance shall not be granted to increase the maximum area of signs as permitted in a zoning district, nor the maximum number of signs. A variance shall not be granted to approve a billboard nor to convert an existing sign to electronic signage. 
                  14.4.5 Self-inflicted hardship. The board shall not grant variances when the hardship was created by the property owner or his predecessor, and shall not grant hardship variances based on shape or topography for lots of record not existing prior to February 21, 1996. Configuring a subdivision to create lots that are difficult to build is an example of a hardship created by the property owner or processor, that do not justify a variance. 
                  14.4.6 Place of worship. In compliance with Federal law, if the variance is requested by a place of worship or church, in connection with the exercise of religion, the board shall additionally consider whether the regulation imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion, whether the regulation serves a compelling governmental interest, whether the denial is the least restrictive means to serve that interest, or whether the variance can be granted without harming that interest. 
                  14.4.7 Group homes. If the variance is related to a group home for persons with a disability, the board shall additionally consider what reasonable accommodations in this ordinance can be made to provide persons with a disability equal opportunities to use and enjoy dwellings, while not abrogating the purposes of this ordinance. Any reasonable accommodation should only relate to the disability.

                  14.5.2 Published notice. Due notice of the public hearings pursuant to this ordinance shall be published in the newspaper of general circulation within the county. Notice advertising the hearing on the appeal or variance and indicating date, time, place and purpose of the public hearing shall be published at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing. The cost of the advertisement shall be borne by the applicant.

                  14.5.3 Letters to adjacent property owners.

Said notice shall be given to each adjoining property owner by first class mail, with proof of mailing obtained from the post office. Proof of mailing means either a first class "certificate of mailing" or a first class "certified mail" receipt; a proof of delivery is not required.

                  (D)  The variance requested or the subject matter of the appeal and the reason for the requested variance or the appeal; and 
                  (E)  The date, time and place of the public hearing on said requested appeal or variance. 
                  14.5.5 Recording hearing. The applicant may arrange for and provide a certified court reporter to transcribe the hearing before the board of appeals, at the expense of the applicant.

                  Sec. 14.6. - Stay of proceedings. 
                  An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board of appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a stay granted by the board of appeals or by a restraining order issued by a court of record on application, on notice to the zoning administrator, and for due cause shown.

                  14.8.2 Matter presented; out of order applications. The secretary of the board of appeals will read the proposed appeal or variance under consideration in the order determined by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator, or his designee, shall then present the basis of the appeal or variance, along with the pertinent departmental reviews, if any, prior to receiving public input on the proposed appeal or variance. Any appeal or variance that has not complied with all notice and other requirements of this ordinance shall be deemed out of order and shall not be considered at that hearing. It shall be postponed until the next meeting, and if it is still out of order at the next meeting, the application shall be deemed denied. 
                  14.8.3 Speakers. The secretary of the board of appeals shall call each person who has signed up to speak on the appeal or variance then before the board of appeals in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except the applicant who will always speak first. Prior to speaking, the speaker will identify himself or herself and state his/her current address. Only those persons who signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless a majority of the members of the board of appeals present at the hearing allow the person to speak to the appeal or variance, notwithstanding the failure of the person to sign up prior to the hearing. 
                  14.8.4 Time limits. The applicant or appellant and those in favor of the variance or appeal shall have 15 minutes to speak, total. Those opposed to the application or appeal shall have 15 minutes to speak, total. The board may extend these times upon majority vote.

                  14.8.6 Decorum and order. Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed appeal or variance under consideration and shall address his/her remarks only to the members of the board of appeals. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or the discussion of facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed appeal under consideration. The chair may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the chair from conducting the hearing in an orderly and decorous manner to assure that the public hearing on the appeal or variance is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.

                  14.9.1 Appeal to commissioner. Recourse from a decision by the board of appeals shall be to the commissioner of the county, by filing a written notice of appeal within 30 days of the board of appeal's decision.

The commissioner's hearing shall be noticed according to the requirements of 14.5.2, 14.5.3 and 14.5.4, including published notice, sign, and letters to adjacent property owners. The hearing shall be open to the public, but public comment shall not be taken. At the hearing, the commissioner shall review the evidence presented below, which shall automatically include the zoning ordinance, official zoning map, the county's file on the application, and any other county ordinance relevant to the dispute.

                  ARTICLE XV. - AMENDMENTS 

                  Sec. 15.1. - Initiation of amendments. 
                  15.1.1 Text amendment. An application to amend the text of this ordinance may be initiated by the planning commission or be submitted to the planning commission by the commissioner, zoning staff, or by any person having an interest in the county. 
                  15.1.2 Map amendment. An application to amend the future land use map or the official zoning maps may be initiated by the planning commission or be submitted to the planning commission by the commissioner or zoning staff, property owner or agent of the owner. Unless initiated by the commissioner, the planning commission or zoning staff, all applications to amend the future land use map or official zoning maps must be submitted by an owner of the affected property or an authorized agent of an owner, following procedures set forth in sections 15.2 and 15.3. If submitted by an agent of the owner, such authorization shall be notarized and attached to the application. If a property has multiple owners, only one owner need file the application, and it will be assumed that the other owners consent; however, if any owner does not consent to the application (or otherwise objects), the rezoning application will not go forward. If owned by a corporation or other entity, the application must be filed by a person with proper corporate or entity authority, and the zoning administrator may require documentation to support a claim of authority. In the event there are separate owners of the surface rights and the mineral rights, both will be treated as an independent owner and be allowed to file for rezoning, regardless if the other party objects. 
                  15.1.3 Resubmission after denial. In the event an application for an amendment to the zoning map has been denied, another rezoning application affecting the same property shall not be submitted nor accepted until 12 months have passed from the date of the final decision by the commissioner. In the event an application for an amendment to the future land use map has been denied, another land use map application affecting the same property shall not be submitted nor accepted until 12 months have passed from the date of the final decision by the commissioner. The commissioner may reduce either twelve-month time interval by resolution, to a minimum of six months. 
                  15.1.4 Alter conditions. An application to alter conditions of rezoning may be submitted at any time after the final decision of the commissioner. The applicant must show a change in circumstances or additional information not available to the applicant at the time of the original decision by the commissioner to impose the condition. Another application to alter the same condition shall not be submitted more than once every 12 months, such interval to begin on the date of the final decision by the commissioner on said application to amend the condition. 
                  15.1.5 Withdrawal. An application may be withdrawn without prejudice at any time prior to 6:00 p.m. on the day of the planning commission hearing. The planning commission may give permission for a withdrawal without prejudice at its hearing. Withdrawal after the planning commission's hearing shall mean such application may not be resubmitted for consideration for a period of six months, counting from the date of withdrawal to the date of renewed application. Unless withdrawn at the hearing, the withdrawal must be in writing, signed and dated by the applicant. 
                  15.1.6 Reduced requirements for county applications. The requirements of section 15.2 (including limitation as to number accepted) do not apply to any application for amendment initiated by the zoning department staff, the planning commission or the commissioner, and such applications shall only contain such information as is required by the zoning administrator. County initiated map changes do not require that the county send letters to property owners or post signs on properties affected. Such notice is not required under the zoning procedures law and is not practical when the county changes large numbers of parcels at one time. 
                  15.1.7 Simultaneous applications. If multiple amendments are submitted on one parcel, the are considered in the following order: 1) text amendments; 2) future land use map amendment; 3) zoning map amendment; 4) conditional use permit; 5) zoning condition amendment. Each application shall be voted on separately, in the above-stated order. If a rezoning change is denied and the proposed conditional use is not permitted in the original zoning district, that application shall be denied. 
                  15.1.8 Campaign contribution disclosures. Applicants and opponents to rezoning actions that change the zoning district on a parcel are requested to consult the Conflict of Interest in Zoning Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-1, which requires disclosure of campaign contributions, made within two years of the rezoning application, and aggregating $250.00 or more, to any planning commission member or the commissioner. Such disclosures should be filed at least five calendar days prior to the planning commission's hearing on forms available at the zoning office. Violation of this act shall not affect the validity of the rezoning, but such action may be a misdemeanor under O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-4.

                  15.4.1 A planning commission was established by previous version of this ordinance, and remains authorized under this ordinance. Existing commission members shall continue in their current terms unaffected by the adoption of this ordinance. The planning commission of the county consists of seven members appointed by the commissioner for staggered terms of three years. The commission shall meet every other month or on such other schedule as it chooses to adopt, but in no event less than four times per year. If there are no agenda items, the regularly scheduled meeting shall be cancelled. 
                  15.4.2 Members. Members shall be paid per meeting at a rate established by the commissioner and may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred while representing the commission. Appointments shall be made by resolution of the commissioner. Any vacancy in the membership of the commission shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the initial appointment. Members shall be removable for cause by the county commissioner upon written charges and after a public hearing; provided, however, that any member who fails to attend three consecutive meetings, without cause, may be removed without a public hearing. The commission may adopt such by-laws as it deems necessary to provide for the orderly conduct of its business. The commission previously appointed by the commissioner shall continue to serve without change as if appointed under this ordinance. 
                  15.4.3 Public hearing. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on each application for an amendment pursuant to this ordinance in accordance with a schedule adopted by the commission. As to each application, the planning Commission shall make a recommendation for approval, approval with conditions, or denial. A tie vote on any motion shall equate to denial.

The zoning administrator, or his designee, shall then present the amendment, along with the pertinent departmental reviews, if any, prior to receiving public input on the proposed amendment. If an application is not complete, or all requirements of this ordinance have not been complied with, the application is out of order and may be taken off the agenda. It shall be postponed until the next meeting of the planning commission. If the application has already been advertised and persons wishing to speak have appeared for the hearing, the commission may chose to hear from them, but an additional hearing shall be required. If the application is still incomplete or out of order at the next meeting, it shall be deemed withdrawn. The applicant shall have to wait six months to reapply. 
                  15.5.3 Speakers. The secretary of the planning commission will then call each person who has signed up to speak on the amendment in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except the applicant, who will always speak first. Prior to speaking, the speaker will identify himself or herself and state his or her current address. Only those persons who signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless a majority of the commission, in its discretion, allows the person to speak to the amendment, notwithstanding the failure of the person to sign up prior to the hearing. 
                  15.5.4 Time limits. Each speaker shall be allowed five minutes to address the planning commission concerning the amendment then under consideration, unless the planning commission, by majority vote of the members present, votes to allow additional time for a particular speaker to address the commission on said proposed amendment. The applicant shall have a minimum of ten minutes for his presentation (including all related witnesses or experts). The applicant may initially use all of the time allotted to him to speak, or he may speak and reserve a portion of his allotted time for rebuttal.

In all circumstances, in order to comply with state law, the proponent(s) and opponent(s) of each amendment shall have no less than ten minutes per side for presentation of data, evidence, and opinion thereon; if there is only one applicant or opponent, such person shall have the full ten minutes if desired. In the event the opponents collectively take more than ten minutes, the applicant's time shall be extended similarly if desired. One member of the planning commission shall be designated as the time keeper to record the time expended by each speaker. 
                  15.5.5 Decorum and order. Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed amendment under consideration and shall address his remarks only to the members of the planning commission. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or the discussion of facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed amendment under consideration. The chair may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the chair from conducting the hearing in an orderly and decorous manner to assure that the public hearing on a proposed amendment is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.

So that the purpose of this ordinance will be served, health, public safety and general welfare secured, the commissioner may approve or deny the application, reduce the land area for which the application is made, change the district or land use category requested, or add or delete conditions of the application. The commissioner shall have the power to impose a different zoning classification from the classification requested, and impose any zoning conditions which ameliorate the impact of the zoning, or serve other lawful purposes of this ordinance. The submission of an application for a rezoning shall be deemed notice of this power and consent to any such action. The commissioner may also remand the application, if it has been changed or for any reason, to the planning commission for further review and recommendation. 
                  15.6.3 Tabling application. The commissioner shall have the power to table incomplete applications, or to seek more time for further information to be submitted. The action by the commissioner to table the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application will be considered, which statement shall constitute public notice of the hearing on the application; and no further notice, such as that required by section 15.3, is required.

The grant or denial of a conditional use permit is a zoning decision and such decision shall follow the procedures for a rezoning, as specified in sections 15.3 through 15.7, unless modified by the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  16.1.2 Any use which may be authorized by a conditional use permit may be approved by the county commissioner only if, in the exercise of the commissioner's legislative discretion, he finds that: 
                  (A)  A proper application has been filed in accordance with the requirements of the ordinance; 
                  (B)  A recommendation has been received from the planning commission in accordance with the provisions of article XV; 
                  (C)  The applicant is in compliance with the particular conditions for the proposed conditional use that are required by this ordinance; 
                  (D)  The use is consistent with the purposes and intent of this ordinance; and 
                  (E)  After considering the application and the facts, and the standards for making a zoning decision contained in section 15.9 of this ordinance, the commissioner determines that the standards are satisfied such that the benefits of and need for the proposed conditional use outweigh any possible harmful effects, negative impacts, or damages to the neighboring properties or the county in general. 
                  16.1.3 In compliance with federal law, if the conditional use is requested by a place of worship or church, in connection with the exercise of religion, the planning commission and commissioner shall additionally consider whether the regulation imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion, whether the regulation serves a compelling governmental interest, whether the denial is the least restrictive means to serve that interest, or whether the conditional use can be granted without harming that interest. 
                  16.1.4 If the conditional use is related to a group home for persons with a disability, the board shall additionally consider what reasonable accommodations in this ordinance can be made to provide persons with a disability equal opportunities to use and enjoy dwellings, while not abrogating the purposes of this ordinance. Any reasonable accommodation should only relate to the disability.

                  The commissioner shall consider all evidence in the record in making his decision. This ordinance is automatically a part of the record in each case, as is the entire application file. The commissioner shall have the power to table the application for further information to be presented, or to remand the application to the planning commission if new information has been presented that they have not considered. The commissioner shall have the power to grant, deny, or grant with further specific conditions imposed. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 )

                  16.3.1 The applicant shall have up to 15 minutes to present his case, and submit all evidence and witnesses for the record, and opponents shall have equal opportunity to present their case. The applicant can request additional time if voluminous evidence is to be submitted, and may be granted at the discretion of the commissioner. Equal time shall be allowed to the opponent. The county, as represented by the zoning administrator or his designee, or the county attorney or his designee, shall have the right and equal time to present any witnesses and evidence into the record it chooses. 
                  16.3.2 The applicant or his attorney shall have a right to cross-examine any witnesses in opposition to the application, and one representative or attorney of the opponents shall have a similar opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses. The county shall also have a similar opportunity to cross-examine all witnesses. 
                  16.3.3 The commissioner may question any witness, or request further information and table a decision for one month to await additional information or evidence. The commissioner may also request expert reports or studies relating to the request, and shall similarly table the application in such cases. An application may only be tabled one time without the consent of the applicant. 
                  16.3.4 The hearing shall be recorded in some fashion and that recording preserved for 60 days after the decision, or during the pendency of any appeal that is filed in superior court.

Such appeal shall be reviewed on the record presented before the planning commission and commissioner, as held by the Supreme Court of Georgia in City of Roswell v. Fellowship Christian Sch., Inc., 281 Ga. 767, 768, 642 S.E.2d 824, 825 (2007).

It is the intent that any provision declared unconstitutional shall be severed from the ordinance, and the remainder of the ordinance remain in effect. 
                  (Ord. of 2-7-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 17.3. - Repealer.

                  the commissioner finds: 
                  (1)  Adult establishments, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, human trafficking, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects. 
                  (2)  Adult establishments should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other adult establishments, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of adult establishments in one area. 
                  (3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the county has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the county's rationale for this appendix, exists independent of any comparative analysis between adult establishments and other businesses. Additionally, the county's interest in regulating adult establishments extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future adult establishments that may locate in the county. The county finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this appendix are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
                  The county hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of adult establishments, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

                  (7)  Status of platted streets and other public spaces and utilities. After final approval by the development review committee and the completion of all improvements required by these regulations and the expiration of the required maintenance bond period, the owner/developer may request the county to accept platted streets and other public spaces and utilities by preparing deeds to be reviewed by the community development department fully describing the streets and infrastructure to be accepted by resolution of the Bartow County Commissioner.

                  (3)  Double frontage. For double frontage lots (i.e., lots having street frontage both in front and rear) in residential subdivisions along major thoroughfares, a no-access easement of at least ten feet in width, across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting said major thoroughfare. The no-access easement shall be planted with a single line of shrubs or trees, or contain a solid or decorative fence, or contain other such screening treatment as may be proposed by the developer and approved by the development review committee. For double frontage lots in subdivisions along minor collectors or local streets, there shall also be a no-access easement as described above, except that any planting or screening of the no-access easement shall be at the sole option of the developer. 
                  (4)  Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street line.

                  (6)  Street access. Every lot hereafter established shall front or abut on a street which is to be dedicated to the public and conforms to the requirements of these regulations, unless on an approved driveway easement or as otherwise approved by the development review committee. Generally, lots shall not derive access exclusively from any street designated as an arterial or collector street on the roadway classification map. If access must be obtained from an arterial or collector street, single family residential driveways shall be designed and arranged to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic. Multiple family residential driveways and drives serving all nonresidential land uses shall be designed and arranged to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on all streets. A maximum of 150 residential dwelling units shall be allowed to be constructed with only one street outlet on an existing public street. If a second access to an existing public street is not available or, in the opinion of the development review committee, could induce non-residential traffic through the development, a single entrance may be allowed if designed to accommodate a traffic signal and/or sufficient right-of-way and improvements to provide a protected left-turn lane, subject to the approval of the Bartow County Community Development Department.

                  ARTICLE III. - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS[1] 

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Apr. 15, 2015, § III, deleted the former Art. III, §§ 3.1—3.9, and enacted a new Art. III as set out herein. The former Art. III pertained to campground standards and derived from an ordinance adopted Nov. 9, 2005(1). 

                  Sec. 3.1. - Generally. 
                  When someone desires to conduct land-disturbing activities, it is necessary to submit site construction documents for review. Bartow County generally does not require a land disturbance permit for individual residential building lots. However, all other forms of land disturbing activities do require such permits. For the purposes of determining compliance with certain provisions of these regulations, redevelopment means "a land development project on a previously developed site, but excludes ordinary maintenance activities, remodeling of existing buildings, resurfacing of paved areas, and exterior changes or improvements which do not materially increase or concentrate stormwater runoff, or cause additional nonpoint source pollution." 
                  The engineering division of the community development department coordinates the review and approval process for all site construction documents submitted to Bartow County for permitting under this section. It is important that all information requested on the application for plan review is completed. The failure to complete or provide all information may result in delays and/or the requirement of re-submittal of an application. Acceptance of plans by Bartow County shall not constitute or guarantee any rights unless such plans are prepared in accordance with the development regulation. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the plans. In the event an application is determined by staff to contain false or misleading information, any permit issued hereunder may be revoked or suspended with penalties assessed. For permitting a structure, a structural plan submittal is necessary as provided in section 18-161 of the Building Code for Bartow County. Additionally, it is advisable that an applicant obtains a water and/or sewer availability letter prior to commencing the permitting process. 
                  Approval of plans by Bartow County officials or employees shall not imply nor transfer acceptance of responsibility for the application of the principles of engineering, architecture, landscape architecture or any other profession, from the professional corporation or individual under whose hand or supervision the plans were prepared and sealed. 
                  In any development or subdivision in this county, the improvements, facilities, and utilities described in this article shall be planned for and provided by the developer, by installation and/or payment prior to the approval of the development or manufactured house park. In addition, all development or subdivision in this county must comply with the following requirements, as applicable: 
                  (1)  Relevant ordinances and construction plans. Any person wishing to develop or redevelop commercial, industrial or multi-family property, or subdivide residential, commercial, or industrial property, must submit construction plans (with hydrology), that also comply with the Bartow County Stormwater Management Ordinance, the Bartow County Floodplain Management/Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, and the Bartow County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Ordinance. 
                  (2)  Interdepartmental review and approval. The community development department shall not issue a permit for any development activities until all plats and construction plans, as applicable, have been approved by the development review committee as may have authority or jurisdiction over said activities in whole or in part. 
                  (3)  Review of plats and plans required. All preliminary plats, concept plans, construction plans and final plats must be submitted to the development review committee for review and approval prior to the commencement of land disturbance or construction activities. All information requested on plan transmittal applications for plat or plan review must be provided; incomplete applications will not be accepted. Likewise all plats and plans must contain the minimum information outlined in this article. The absence of necessary design data shall result in plats and plans being resubmitted for a future plan review date. 
                  (4)  Review by departments. The community development department shall oversee communication with reviewing departments during the two-week review period regarding review comments prior to a development control review meeting. There is the possibility of delaying approvals if the Natural Resource Conservation Service warrants an extended review period. 
                  (5)  Paved streets. The developer/subdivider of any development or redevelopment or subdivision shall provide adequate streets and shall pave said streets according to minimum requirements (including appropriate width) as provided in these regulations. No subdivision shall be permitted on an unpaved street. 
                  (6)  Public water required. All residential developments must be connected to a governmentally-owned public water system, at the expense of the developer, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bartow County Water Department, including the Water Service and Conservation Ordinance (Code section 74-31 et seq.), and the Sewer System Ordinance (Code section 75-251 et seq.), and including the Water Department Development Procedures. 
                  (7)  Street names. The developer shall submit the names of streets and developments for approval by the county in accordance with these regulations certifying that the proposed names are not confusingly similar to other existing named streets or developments. The decision of the county approving or disapproving the proposed names shall be final.

                  Sec. 3.2. - Submittal process. 
                  It shall be the policy of Bartow County to review development proposals for compliance with the standards adopted by the Bartow County Commissioner. This policy shall also include performing this review in a timely manner so as not to delay development. In order to enhance operational efficiency of this policy it is imperative that developers thoroughly familiarize themselves with all the pertinent Bartow County Subdivision and Development policies, regulations and standards. The one stop development review process provides the development community the opportunity to meet with representatives from each agency/department/division prior to the production of construction documents in order to obtain data critical to the design of the project. A pre-application conference shall be scheduled in accordance with subsection 3.2.2. 
                  (1)  General procedures. 
                  (A)  All fees for both residential and non-residential developments shall be determined by resolution of the Bartow County Commissioner.

                  (C)  A traffic management plan, prepared by a qualified professional engineer shall be submitted at the discretion of the county engineer, based on the size and intensity of the development, and traffic conditions. The traffic management plan must identify any traffic problems that will be generated by the development and present reasonable solutions to those problems. This plan must be submitted to the county engineer for approval. 
                  (2)  Pre-application conference/concept review. 
                  (A)  For the purpose of expediting applications and reducing construction plan design and development costs, the developer shall be required to consult informally with the development review committee. When residential in nature the developer should consult with a representative of the Bartow County Board of Education. The developer shall submit six copies of sketch plans showing one or more designs for the proposed development and a map of the vicinity showing the relationship between the proposed development and nearby physical features, streets, subdivisions, and/or acreage tracts. The developer shall not be bound by the determination of the pre-application conference, nor shall the development review staff be bound by any such review. 
                  (B)  A pre-application conference can be scheduled through the community development department for each Thursday. The request for a pre-application conference must be made by calling the department by 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday of the preceding week (in other words, eight days prior to the requested conference date). The following information shall be required at the time the pre-application conference is requested: 
                  (1)  A preliminary or conceptual site layout plan, if available.

The application, along with six copies of the preliminary plat along with a PDF copy on a CD or other electronic means (such as email) and the appropriate fee, shall be submitted to the department no later than 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday of two weeks prior to the week in which a preliminary plat review conference is desired (15 days prior to the requested conference date). Preliminary plats submitted after this deadline will not be reviewed and commented on by the development review committee for the desired meeting. A land disturbance permit number will be assigned to each project to assist in tracking plans during the process. 
                  (A)  A letter, email or other correspondence from the United States Postal Service indicating the type of mail delivery that will be available to the proposed development shall be provided. The correspondence should also indicate, either by description or attached drawing, that the proposed location for the cluster mailbox station(s), if applicable, is acceptable to the postal service. 
                  (2)  Review of preliminary plat. Each project submitted for review shall be allotted a 30-minute appointment for the date and time assigned for review before the development review committee. If a developer, engineer, surveyor or landscape architect has several projects for review on the same week, an effort will be made to schedule contiguous appointments for his or her convenience. However, appointment times are scheduled on a first come-first served basis. Only those projects scheduled well in advance may be so scheduled. 
                  (3)  Actions taken by community development department. After receipt of recommendations from the development review committee reviews the preliminary plat, the department shall do one of the following in writing:

Inventory information regarding Category II dams within Bartow County may be obtained through the Georgia Safe Dams Program. 
                  (J)  The maximum allowable size for construction plans shall be 24 inches by 36 inches. The preparation of construction plans shall include all the applicable information outlined in these regulations. A list of the staff members of the development review committee that assist in the review and approval of the site design plans is maintained by the community development department. Each County agency/department/division involved in the review and approval process can provide a list of data required to complete compliance with the development standards (also referred to as checklists). 
                  (K)  The applicant is responsible for submitting a set of plans to the appropriate utility department of each municipality as applicable. 
                  (3)  Construction plan review conference. Each project submitted for review shall be allotted a 30-minute appointment for the date and time assigned for review before the development review committee. If a developer, engineer, surveyor or landscape architect has several projects for review on the same week, an effort will be made to schedule contiguous appointments for his or her convenience. However, appointment times are scheduled on a first come-first served basis. Only those projects scheduled well in advance may be so scheduled. Comments and recommendations will be discussed during the scheduled meeting. Should any agency/department/division determine insufficient information, detail, or design is provided; a project may be required to be re-submitted for a later date. Once documents are re-submitted, an appointment will be scheduled. 
                  (4)  Project approval. Following completion of the construction plan review conference, an individual shall be required to incorporate all comments and recommendations into a revised set of construction plans. Bartow County offers two approval process methods by which a land disturbance permit may be obtained. These are the one stop approval conference and walk-through approval. Both of these are described below. Under either method, eight sets of amended site construction plans must be presented to the individual county agency/department/division for approval and sign-off. Additionally, two copies of the amended hydrology study must be submitted to the engineering division. The amended plans must be accompanied by the red-line "Plan Review Copy" of the plans and by the package of comments returned by each agency/department/divisions. Additionally, the agency/department/division shall evidence its approval by signature on the plans. Should these projects fall outside the jurisdictional boundaries of a Bartow County Agency/Department/Division such as water, or sewer, those jurisdictions' approval must be shown on the face of the documents. Upon receiving approval from all agencies/departments/divisions and affected outside jurisdictions, the applicant is granted a land disturbance permit. Eight sets of amended site construction plans and two copies of the stormwater management plan shall be presented for approval. 
                  (A)  One stop approval conference. The one stop development procedure provides the opportunity to obtain the signatures of all agency/department/division representatives at one location at a specified time. Requests for appointments for the resubmittal Conference may be made with the community development department no later than 12:00 p.m. on Friday of the preceding week. Appointment times will be scheduled on a first come, first serve basis. Appointments will be confirmed between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. on Monday for appointments scheduled for the following Thursday. The following information will be necessary at the time the request is made for an appointment: 
                  (1)  Project name and Bartow County project number (assigned during the review process). 
                  (2)  Name of contact and telephone number for confirmation. 
                  (3)  Name of person to attend the approval conference. 
                  Appointments will be assigned in 15-minute increments. Some waiting may be anticipated depending on the scope and scale of the projects scheduled earlier. It is important that all parties adhere to the scheduled times to minimize the time necessary to obtain the permit once the plans have begun to be processed. Applicants should make every effort to provide all pertinent information to staff as needed; otherwise this creates delays in the approval process. Cancellations or postponements may require that the plans be approved at a later date by each agency/department/division. This will require each individual agency/department/division to review and approve plans by scheduled appointments only. 
                  (B)  Walk-through approval. Projects that are large in scope, those that require specific impact studies, and those that contain environmental, historical, or archaeologically sensitive areas are not normally appropriate for the one stop approval conference. (However, these projects may be scheduled if all agencies/departments/divisions are satisfied that all requirements have been met for construction to be permitted. Every attempt will be made to ensure that no project will be scheduled for the resubmittal conference that has not met these requirements.) It is the responsibility of the party seeking final approval to ensure that these conditions have been satisfied. For walk-through approvals, appointments should be scheduled with each individual agency/department/division on any business day. 
                  (C)  The community development department will issue a conditional land disturbance permit letter for the project upon successfully obtaining the final approval of the development review committee. Once all required documentation, including bonds and/or letters of credit, preconstruction certifications, a copy of the NPDES notice of intent (NOI) ensuring compliance with the state general permit and appropriate permit fees have be submitted to the community development department, the development permit will be delivered to the project site by the department's development inspector at the time of the scheduled pre-construction meeting as required in these regulations. 
                  (D)  Construction plan approval binding one year. Approval of the site construction plans shall be effective and binding upon the county for a period not to exceed one year from the date of approval and shall thereafter expire and be null and void except to the extent that work on the project has progressed, unless a request for an extension of time has been submitted to and is subsequently approved by the community development department. Land disturbing activities under this permit must commence within 120 days after issuance of permit. Failure to begin work may be cause for the permit to be canceled. Once a permit has been canceled, it cannot be reactivated for any reason. A new set of construction plans must be submitted in accordance with these regulations when the applicant is ready to begin land disturbance. 
                  (5)  Required documentation prior to issuance of permit; sureties. No land disturbance permit shall be issued by the county to the developer until a surety or sureties have been furnished to the engineering division, in forms acceptable to the county (bond, cash deposit, or escrow account) for the various requirements of this ordinance. The county's preference shall be for irrevocable standby letters of credit. Such irrevocable letter of credit must be issued in conformant with the latest ICC Publication governing irrevocable standby letters of credit, and must be issued by a bank or other financial institution with a physical branch in Bartow County (unless this requirement is waived by the concurrence of county engineer and county attorney). Said letter of credit shall be issued by a company or financial institution authorized to do business in the State of Georgia, in a form acceptable to Bartow County. Bartow County reserves the right to reject any proffered irrevocable letter of credit and require a surety bond. Bartow County Engineering Division may, at its discretion, agree to accept surety bond in lieu of an irrevocable letter of credit. Said bond must be in a form acceptable to Bartow County. If the applicant prefers a cash escrow deposit, that will be accepted, with the proceeds being deposited in a separate Bartow County-controlled bank account for the duration of the surety. See Section 6.142 for the method to calculate the amount of surety required in this section. 
                  The purpose of the sureties shall be any or all of the following, depending on the particular development: 1) to secure performance of the erosion and sedimentation control work in compliance with county regulations; 2) to ensure proper construction of roads, stormwater facilities and other improvements that are to be dedicated to the county in new developments; 3) to ensure proper construction of any work performed in existing Bartow County rights-of-way; 4) to provide a guaranty for the warranty and maintenance period applicable to any new road or work in any existing county right-of-way. 
                  All original preconstruction certifications shall be submitted to the engineering division prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit. 
                  (A)  EandS surety. Prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit the developer shall cause to be executed in favor of Bartow County, an original irrevocable letter of credit in an amount as set forth by the Bartow County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance. Said irrevocable letter of credit is for guaranty of soil erosion and sedimentation best management practices (BMPs). The letter of credit shall remain in force until all final stabilization erosion and sedimentation control measures are in place. Once erosion and sedimentation control BMPs are complete, and the site is stabilized, the county may, at the discretion of the county engineer, authorize a release of the required letter of credit. If the developer does not comply with these regulations or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the county may call the irrevocable letter of credit or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to install soil erosion and sedimentation prevention measures. 
                  (B)  New road construction surety. Prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit the developer shall cause to be executed in favor of Bartow County an original letter of credit for the costs of completion of new roads and associated stormwater and other improvements in a development. Such surety shall also cover the cost of necessary utility relocations and installations. The amounts shall be calculated as set forth in these regulations. This surety shall be released when as-built certifications are provided and the road is accepted by the county as a public road. At that point, the two-year maintenance period begins and the maintenance surety is required. 
                  (C)  Existing right-of-way construction surety. Prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit the developer shall submit a surety bond or letter of credit for all access roads intersecting existing county roads and all work in existing rights of way, including stormwater improvements, utility relocations and installations, and other improvements. In addition, all offsite improvements required per the approved construction plans shall be covered in the existing right-of-way construction surety. Said letter of credit is for guarantee of roadway construction in conformance with Bartow County development standards and to ensure completion of improvements to existing county roads. The surety shall remain in force until all roadway entrances and construction have been completed to the satisfaction of the engineering division and in accordance with approved plans and roadway standards, including all AASHTO and MUTCD requirements. This surety may be combined and made part of the new road construction surety required above. 
                  (D)  Maintenance sureties. All work in the existing right-of-way and all new roads shall be warranted for a two-year period commencing with acceptance of the roads, in the case of new roads, or completion of the work, in the case of work in the existing right-of-way. Maintenance sureties shall be provided at or near the conclusion of the construction, as required by these regulations. 
                  (E)  Preconstruction certifications. Prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit the developer shall have the design professional submit the following certifications for the various design components of the project, as applicable:

Some minimal clearing may be required to complete the installation of these devices. 
                  (7)  Grading permit. When soil erosion/sediment control devices have been properly installed, the Development Inspector shall issue a grading permit to the applicant or his/her designee. 
                  ( Ord. of 4-15-2015, § III ) 
                  Sec. 3.5. - Reports and inspections. 
                  (1)  Development pre-construction conference. Upon completion of construction plan review and prior to beginning any land disturbing activities, the developer shall phone the community development department to schedule a pre-construction conference to be held on the site of the project. The primary purpose of this conference is to discuss policy, procedures and construction plans and to present the developer with the development permit. The following action items shall be completed prior to the developer requesting a preconstruction conference with the appropriate county officials: 
                  (A)  The land disturbance permit fee and inspection fees shall be paid along with providing all required letters of credit and bonds, as applicable. For the calculation of county permit and inspection fees, contact the community development department.

                  Sec. 3.8. - Plan revisions after permit approval. 
                  Upon approval of plans, the applicant's project will be inspected for conformance to the approved plans. Inspectors are not authorized to approve field changes that expand, relocate, or delete the construction as described on the approved construction plans. Should such changes be desired or made necessary as a result of field conditions, the design engineer should contact the development review committee to coordinate approval of the appropriate revision. A minimum of eight sets of revised sets of revised construction plans must be presented for approval. If the hydrology study has also been revised, two copies must be provided. The agency/department/division whose approval is necessary for the change must be contacted individually for an appointment or a one-stop approval conference may be scheduled, if deemed appropriate. Re-submittal of amendments or revisions must clearly identify the changes or revisions desired. Field changes by the applicant require as-builts to be submitted by the design engineer to the development review committee for approval prior to final plat approval. 
                  Drawings that are submitted for revision must specifically identify those areas that are to be considered for review and approval. The revisions should be noted in tabular form in the revision block on the drawings, similar to that shown below.

                  Sec. 3.43. - Digital data submission standards. 
                  Bartow County has adopted geographic information system (GIS) technologies to store, manage and maintain geographic/spatially-related data. The civil engineering community has evolved as well to the point where the predominant design environment is computer aided design and drafting (CAD) or GIS. It is the goal of the county to use both CAD and GIS technologies to expedite the design and review processes within the administration, by developing standards and procedures for integration of digital engineering CAD drawings in to the GIS environment, maintaining the integrity and positional accuracy of the data. 
                  Below are the requirements and options for submission of digital data as required for county construction projects. Please note that those levels shown in bold italics are required concurrent with plan submission. 
                  (1)  File format. Acceptable file formats are Autocad.DWG, Microstation.DGN, Esri Shapefile.SHP, XML Workspace Document.XML, Esri File Geodatabase.GDB or Esri Personal Geodatabase.MDB. 
                  (2)  Acceptable media formats for data submission include CDs, DVDs or email. 
                  (3)  Coordinate system. The standard coordinate system for all digital mapping in Bartow County shall be in the Georgia State Plane Coordinate System, West Zone, 1983 North American Datum. This coordinate system uses base units of U.S. Survey foot. Bartow County will accept digital data files only in this projection. 
                  (4)  Other information: 
                  (A)  Contact name. 
                  (B)  Contact phone number. 
                  (C)  Contact address. 
                  (5)  Overview of layers. Bartow County recognizes that each engineering and design firm has created their own set of standard CAD and data layers. Therefore Bartow County will accept digital files with any layering scheme as long as there is sufficient separation of categories. Listed below are the minimum layer categories for separation:

                  Sec. 5.28. - Required improvements. 
                  (a)  Reserved. 
                  (b)  Reserved. 
                  (c)  Erosion and sedimentation. The developer shall comply with the Bartow County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance (Code section 34-251 et seq.) and guidelines set forth in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, latest edition. The location of the erosion control devices may have to be altered from that shown on the approved plans due to changes in drainage patterns created during construction. It is the developer's responsibility to accomplish erosion control for all drainage patterns created at various stages during construction. Any difficulty in controlling erosion during any phase of construction shall be reported to the county immediately. Failure to properly install, operate or maintain all erosion control measures may result in all site activity being stopped, by issuance of a stop-work order, until such measures are corrected to the satisfaction of the county. 
                  (d)  Reserved. 
                  (e)  Surety to county. Prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit the developer shall cause to be executed in favor of Bartow County surety in the form of a performance and maintenance bond, an irrevocable standby letter of credit, or an escrow deposit. The surety must be accepted and approved by the county engineer before the LDP can issue. 
                  (1)  Purpose. The purpose of the surety shall be any or all of the following, depending on the particular development: 1) to secure performance of the erosion and sedimentation control work in compliance with county regulations; 2) to ensure proper construction of roads in new developments; 3) to ensure proper construction of any work performed in existing Bartow County rights-of-way; 4) to provide a guaranty for the warranty and maintenance period applicable to any new road or work in any existing county right-of-way; 5) to provide funds for repair of damage to any existing county roads, including roads contained in earlier phases of the same development, caused by construction traffic in the new development. 
                  (2)  Approval. The surety shall only be issued in a form approved by Bartow County. The language of the surety and the term of the surety must be approved by Bartow County prior to issuance. Bartow County has forms it prefers that surety companies use, and those can be provided upon request; otherwise, the form of the surety shall be approved by the county engineer prior to acceptance of the surety. Any irrevocable standby letter of credit or surety bond shall be issued by a company or financial institution authorized to do business in the State of Georgia. Irrevocable standby letters of credit shall be issued in accordance with International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Publication 590, International Standby Practices "ISP98", and must be issued by a bank having a physical branch in Bartow County, which shall be the place of tender of the draft on said letter of credit. Bartow County reserves the right to demand a specific form of surety from a developer that has tendered unsatisfactory surety in the past. Bartow County reserves the right to reject a surety from a financial institution or insurance company that has provided an unsatisfactory surety in the past. Cash is not an acceptable form of surety. 
                  (3)  Scope. In each case, the surety guarantees that all applicable provisions of any Bartow County ordinances are complied with, including but not limited to, the erosion and sedimentation control ordinance, these development regulations, the utility accommodation ordinance, Bartow County standard road details, and the regulations promulgated under each of the foregoing. 
                  (4)  Amount and term. The amount of the surety depends on the project, and shall be set by the county engineer relying on experience with similar projects and the developer, knowledge of material and labor costs, and investigation of additional costs. The amount shall be sufficient to secure performance of the work and compliance with the county ordinances and regulations. Depending on the elements of the project, the amount can include one or more of the following: 1) For security of erosion and sedimentation control work, the amount shall be sufficient to permanently stabilize the entire project, at a minimum of $3,000.00 per acre of the property to be disturbed. 2) For road work on new roads, the amount shall be sufficient to grade, base and pave all new roads called for on the plans, at a rate to be determined by Bartow County and such rate may be revised from time to time as deemed necessary by the county engineer to reflect current construction costs; the amount shall also be sufficient to pay for associated utility relocations/installations and stormwater controls. 3) For work in existing county rights-of-way, the amount shall be sufficient to ensure repair of the roads after any planned work, including associated utility relocations/installations and stormwater controls, that are part of the project being approved; the minimum amount shall be $25,000.00. 4) For multi-phased developments where construction traffic is traveling through subdivision roads already accepted by the county, the minimum amount shall be $10,000.00 per 0.1 miles (i.e, 1/10 th of a mile) of county-owned subdivision road being crossed by the construction traffic. The foregoing amounts are minimums and can be increased based on a more complex or expensive project, difficult terrain or other factors that would make the remedial work more expensive. No additional separate amount of surety shall be required for maintenance purposes. The term of any surety shall extend for the period from the issuance of the LDP until the project or development is completed, and additionally beyond that for the duration of any applicable warranty and maintenance period. 
                  (5)  Partial release. Once erosion and sedimentation control BMPs are complete, and the site is finally stabilized, the county may, at the discretion of the county engineer, authorize a release of the portion of the surety relating to E and S work. Once a new roadway or roadways have had final "as-built certificates" issued and they have been dedicated and accepted, the county may, at the discretion of the county engineer, release a portion of the surety amount relating to the new roads; the remainder shall be kept as surety for the maintenance period. Once a project within an existing county right-of-way has been completed and inspected, the county may, at the discretion of the county engineer, release a portion of the surety amount relating to the work in the existing right-of-way; the remainder shall be kept as surety for the maintenance period. Once the applicable maintenance period has passed, the remaining surety amount shall be released. In the event there are no new roads nor any work in the county right-of-way that require a warranty period, the surety shall be released upon the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
                  (6)  Prerequisite; calling surety. No land disturbance permit shall be issued by the county until the surety has been furnished to the county, in a form acceptable to the county. If the developer does not comply with these regulations, other applicable Bartow County ordinances and regulations, or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the county may call the surety, or any part thereof, to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to perform the work or hire a contractor to remedy the defects, whether that means installing soil erosion and sedimentation prevention measures, completing paving and road work, or completing other work. 
                  (7)  Waiver. The county engineer shall be authorized, but not required, to reduce or waive the surety requirement for projects undertaken by a municipal government in the county. 
                  (f)  Development plan detail. The developer must submit a set of development plans of the proposed development showing the improvements required by this section which must be approved by the county prior to commencing construction. Said plan shall include, but not be limited to, showing existing two-foot contours, adjacent areas such as streams, lakes, residential areas, etc. which might be affected by proposed development, proposed grades, 100-year flood elevations if applicable, and all improvements. Hydrological studies, engineering computations, flood records and field surveys compiled and certified by an engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia may be required for exact delineation of flood limits and elevations. In addition to the requirements contained in these regulations the developer shall comply with the Bartow County Development Checklist. 
                  (g)  Land disturbance permit. Upon approval of development plans, the property owner must obtain a land disturbance permit. Owner must obtain said permit within 120 days of approval of development plans. If not, the permit may be canceled. Land disturbing activity under the permit must begin within 120 days after issuance of permit. Failure to begin land disturbing activity may be cause for the permit to be canceled. Once a permit has been canceled or voided, it cannot be reactivated or reinstated for any reason. A new set of development plans must be submitted, reviewed and accepted when the applicant is ready to obtain a land disturbance permit. 
                  (h)  Construction exits. The developer shall comply with section 34-267(e) regarding construction exits. 
                  (i)  Utilities. All utilities shall be installed as set out in Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development. 
                  (j)  Altered conditions. If actual site conditions, grading or construction, vary from approved plans, it is the owner/developer's responsibility to inform the engineer of record and the county engineer for assessment of the varied condition. Project construction may be delayed during the assessment period. Revised plans may be required and reviewed. 
                  (k)  Flood zone property. Sites affected by FEMA flood zones shall be referenced to mean sea level vertical datum. A permanent onsite benchmark must be provided. Development shall comply with the Bartow County Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, and a certification consistent with that ordinance shall be provided at the rough inspection stage. 
                  (l)  Flood hazard areas. Sites affected by flood hazard areas not determined by FEMA shall be referenced to the best vertical datum available and acceptable to the county. A permanent onsite benchmark must be provided. Flood hazard areas shall be defined to include detention ponds, retention ponds, drainage easements, headwater pools or backwater from pipes, culverts, dams, channelizations, etc., and any other manmade areas or structures relating to flood, erosion or surface water control, whether located within the floodplain or not. 
                  (m)  Street access required. Access to each lot in said development may only be from a street designed and constructed as part of said development except A-1 district lots may be accessed from county right-of-way provided each lot has a minimum of 200 feet of road frontage. 
                  (n)  Clear-cutting and mass clearing prohibited. The property or lot to be developed shall not be cleared except that amount of land minimally necessary for the foot print of the structure, rights-of-way, required drainage or required parking. 
                  (Ord. of 11-9-2005(3), § 4.2; Ord. of 9-10-2008, § I(4.25); Ord. of 4-15-2015, § IV ; Ord. of 5-11-2016, § VIII ; Ord. of 11-7-2018(2) , § II)

                  b.  Commercial and Industrial pavement widths shall be a minimum of 26 feet wide. A cul-de-sac on any dead end road shall be graded, based and paved to provide a minimum 150 feet turnaround diameter. 
                  c.  Road beds and pavement width in curves shall be properly elevated and paved to provide safe travel. 
                  (2)  Compaction. The road or street must be graded and must achieve a minimum 95 percent modified compaction using a "sheep foot roller" or the equivalent. The community development department must inspect the graded road bed before base material may be applied. 
                  (3)  Drainage pipes. Proper road and street drainage must be installed by the developer at no expense to the county including driveway pipes. A minimum 36 feet of drain pipe shall be provided at each intersection. Pipe shall be of sufficient diameter for maximum water flow projections. The pipe shall be either concrete or pure aluminum pipe. Pipes outside the roadbed may be designed per GDOT standards for HDPE pipe. 
                  (4)  Base. Following inspection of the road bed, the minimum specified approved aggregate base must be applied. Base material and installation must be inspected by the community development department prior to the application of any hard surface (paving).

                  c.  Curb and Gutter but No Sewer. In residential subdivisions without sewer, but where curb and gutter are required, the developer shall have the option of placing the final wearing surface before recording of the final plat, or waiting to place the final wearing surface until after 80 percent build out of all lots in the subdivision, but in the latter case, a letter of credit for the road improvements (at a rate determined by the County Engineer) shall be required. See subsection 5.28(e) for requirements. 
                  d.  Five Year Limitation. In no event shall the final wearing surface be placed later than five years after the recording of the final plat. 
                  e.  For all commercial and industrial projects paving shall be completed and final wearing surface applied prior to issuance of any certificates of occupancy. Specifications for plant mix asphalt shall be as follows: 1) any plant mix asphalt must comply with GDOT guidelines for the appropriate road or street; 2) all streets shall have a minimum thickness of two inches of "B" mix and one and one half inches of "E" mix. See Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development for base requirements and complete roadway cross-section specifications. 
                  (7)  Drainage at low points. Drainage of roadway shall be provided at low points through weep holes to catch basins (see Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development). 
                  (8)  Right-of-way erosion control. Rights-of-way and road shoulders shall be graded, grassed, and/or re-grassed until sufficient ground cover is achieved. 
                  (9)  Final inspection; acceptance. After the road or street has been completed and as-built certified by the engineer of record (see subsection 5.31(14)), the county engineer must perform a final inspection of all paving, drainage and any other aspects related to future maintenance of the road or street. Provided all criteria are met, including final wearing surface having been applied, the county shall officially accept the "roadway as-built certificate." After this point, provided the roadway is to be a public street, the roadway shall be dedicated to the county. The developer shall cause to be prepared a deed of dedication to the county with a proper legal description, providing for dedication to and acceptance by the county of the roadways and associated infrastructure improvements. Upon acceptance of said road or street, the same shall be open to the general public at all times subject only to any restrictions placed upon it by the county. The county shall not be required to accept the dedication until all criteria of these regulations (including application of final wearing surface) are met. 
                  (10)  Construction warnings. The developer shall furnish and maintain all necessary barricades and warning signs in the right-of-way while roadway frontage improvements are being made. 
                  (11)  Warranty and maintenance period. Roadways (including associated infrastructure improvements) shall be warranted for a period of two years from the date of acceptance by the county of the roadways, except for roadways with sanitary sewer, in which case the warranty period shall extend two years from the date of acceptance by the county of the roadways. Work in an existing county right-of-way (for example, access for a new development) shall be warranted for a period of two years. In all cases, the warranty period begins to run on the date the commissioner accepts the deed of dedication by resolution at a public hearing. The warranty shall mean that if the road fails within the warranty period, the road shall be repaired by the permit holder, or else the county shall call the surety to pay for the repair. Road failures include dips in the surface, raveling, potholes, and any other defect that means the road does not meet the standards of county regulations, as determined solely by the county. The surety required by subsection 5.28(e) shall remain in effect the applicable warranty period to secure maintenance. See also subsection 5.31(16).

                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted May 11, 2016, § IX , amended section 5.29 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, section 5.29 pertained to base and paving of streets in non-commercial and non-industrial developments, and derived from an ordinance adopted November 9, 2005, § 4.3; an ordinance adopted September 10, 2008, § I(4.3.11), and an ordinance adopted September 11, 2013, § I. 
                  Sec. 5.30. - Special district assessments for roadway project improvements. 
                  (a)  Purpose and Authority. This section is adopted pursuant to the authority of Article IX, Section II, Paragraph IV of the Georgia Constitution of 1983, authorizing the County to create special districts by ordinance to provide local government services and to provide for assessments to pay for such services. This section is intended to address the problems created by failed subdivisions where the original developer has dissolved, gone bankrupt, or otherwise lost ownership before completing the roads and streets (and associated utility infrastructure) within the development to the required standards of these Development Regulations, or when the original developer has failed to complete the final wearing surface within five years of final plat recording. In compliance with the Development Impact Fee Act (O.C.G.A. § 36-71-1 et seq.), only Roadway Project Improvements (as defined below) shall be constructed under this section. However, in any conflict between authority exercised under the above-cited paragraph of the Constitution and the Development Impact Fee Act, the Constitution shall control. 
                  (b)  Creation. There is hereby created a special district pursuant to Article IX, Section II, Paragraph IV of the Georgia Constitution of 1983 for purposes of upgrading a particular development's internal streets and roads and related water, sewer, and storm water infrastructure, for each subdivision or development that requires Roadway Project Improvements, provided all of the following occur: 
                  (1)  The Community Development Director certifies in writing to the Bartow County Commissioner that a residential subdivision has been lawfully final platted in the unincorporated county; that more than five lots have been sold by the original developer and homes are erected and certificates of occupancy have been issued on such lots; that the original developer no longer owns the development and there is no successor developer who can provide appropriate surety for completion of the roads, or that the original developer has not placed the final wearing surface on the roads within five years of final plat recording; that all or a portion of the roads and streets (and related utility infrastructure) shown on the final plat do not comply with these Development Regulations; and that adequate funds or surety for proper completion of the roadways and associated infrastructure within the residential development was not obtained or has not been honored or otherwise received. 
                  (2)  The Community Development Director provides a cost estimate of the cost of providing all Roadway Project Improvements to bring the development into compliance with the Development Regulations, and provides a cost per vacant lot of constructing such necessary improvements. 
                  (3)  The County Commissioner adopts a resolution designating the subdivision as a special district under this section and approves the construction of the necessary street and related improvements and the implementation of the assessment to recover the costs, such assessment to be imposed only on lots meeting the definition of vacant lots as of the date of the adoption of the Commissioner's resolution. 
                  (c)  Construction and Assessment. Upon creation of the special district, the County shall be authorized to construct the necessary street improvements and impose the assessment on each vacant lot in the subdivision. The building inspections division shall collect the assessment at the time of issuance of a building permit. This fee shall be in addition to and separate from regular building permit fees, water and sewer tap fees, and any other fees required by the Code of Bartow County and regulations adopted thereunder. 
                  (d)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  (1)  Roadway Project Improvement: means site improvements required to provide all the street, road and utility improvements within the right-of-way of a specifically identified residential development that were shown on the final plat and are necessary for the use and convenience of the occupants of the development and necessary to bring the development into compliance with the standards set forth in the Bartow County Development Regulations. Such street, road and utility improvements include, but are not limited to, streets, roads, sidewalks, curb and gutter, and associated utility improvements in the right-of-way such as storm water structures, sewer manholes, water and sewer lateral connections and similar items. 
                  (2)  Vacant lot: means a lot within a residential subdivision for which no certificate of occupancy (C.O.) has been issued by the county, or for which a C.O. has been revoked. This shall include lots with foundations or partially built homes. 
                  (e)  Restrictions. 
                  (1)  Assessments collected under this section shall be spent only on the specific Roadway Project Improvements necessary for the specific development designated as a special district. 
                  (2)  Upon collection of sufficient assessments to equal the cost estimate, the county may commence construction of the improvements. However this provision does not preclude the county from commencing such construction at an earlier date and being reimbursed such expense from the assessments. 
                  (3)  Any costs of installing the Roadway Project Improvements exceeding the cost estimate approved by the Commissioner in a resolution creating the special district shall be absorbed by the County. 
                  (4)  It is not intended that this section be used to provide upgrades to a subdivision that were not called for in the original plat (for example, providing sidewalks where none were called for by the plat) but minor improvements necessitated by changing conditions or new information but not shown on the final plat (for example, an additional storm drain) can be included as a Roadway Project Improvement. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-11-2016, §§ X, XI ) 
                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted May 11, 2016, §§ X, XI , amended section 5.30 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, section 5.30 pertained to base and paving of streets in commercial and industrial developments, and derived from an ordinance adopted November 9, 2005, § 4.4; an ordinance adopted September 10, 2008, § I(4.4.11), and an ordinance adopted September 11, 2013, § I. 
                  Sec. 5.31. - Street design. 
                  The following criteria and requirements are applicable to all street design plans and street designs, in all developments and subdivisions: 
                  (1)  Road plan. Developer must provide road plan and profiles for all streets in the development design. 
                  (2)  Intersection angle. All streets must intersect with other streets at a 90 degree angle. 
                  (3)  Multiple entrances. A maximum number of 150 residential dwelling units shall be allowed with only one street outlet to an existing public road. The second entrance location and design must be approved by county engineer and community development department. If a second access to an existing public road is not available or, in the opinion of the county engineer, could induce non-residential traffic through the development, a single entrance may be allowed. However, such single entrance must be designed with a traffic signal and/or sufficient right-of-way and improvements to provide a protected left-turn lane, subject to the approval of the county engineer and community development department. In such cases, a "knockdown" gate-type second entrance (that is, a gate designed to discourage routine access but able to be knocked down by an emergency vehicle) shall be provided for emergency vehicle access, accessing at least a gravel drive connecting to an interior street. 
                  (4)  Intersection radii. The curb or pavement radii at intersections shall not be less than 25 feet. 
                  (5)  Grades. Street grades shall not be less than 1.5 percent grade nor more than 15 percent grade. 
                  (6)  Sight distance. Intersection sight distance (not to be confused with stopping sight distance) shall be measured from centerline of each proposed intersecting entrance street or driveway. See additional design criteria in Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development. Intersection sight distance is determined with an assumed height of drivers eye of 3.50 feet and an assumed height of object of 4.25 feet when measuring in the vertical plane. When measuring in the horizontal plane, the intersection sight distance is determined with an assumed driver's eye location of ten feet from edge of pavement of the main street on the centerline of the intersecting street and an object location on the centerline of the main street. When measuring in either plane, the line of sight must remain in the proposed dedicated ROW, unless the designer provides a plan showing unimpeded line of sight. Intersection sight distance for internal subdivision streets shall not be less than 200 feet. 
                  (7)  Curve radii. Horizontal curve radii at street centerline shall be not less than 200 feet for streets intersecting with county roads and 100 feet for all other streets. A minimum of 100 feet of tangent must be provided between reverse curves and a minimum of 50 feet of tangent must be provided on intersecting streets. 
                  (8)  Intersections. All intersections with existing county roads must be approved by the community development department. Acceleration and deceleration lanes shall be installed as required by the community development department or engineering department. Determination of whether such lanes are required shall be based on sound engineering principles, traffic safety considerations, and the circumstances of the site, proposed use, and development. Acceleration and deceleration lanes must conform with the details found in Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development. 
                  (9)  Driveway and access permits. A permit must be obtained from the county road department for any street or driveway entering a county road. The permit for a driveway must be obtained before a building permit will be issued except where curb and gutter has been previously installed. 
                  (10)  Right-of-way width. Any road or street in any non-commercial or non-industrial area shall have sufficient right-of-way for proper utility and drainage easements or 60 feet whichever is greater with a cul-de-sac diameter of not less than 70 feet. Right-of-way in any commercial or industrial development shall be not less than 60 feet with a cul-de-sac diameter of not less than 150 feet. 
                  (11)  Curb for non-commercial and non-industrial streets. All non-commercial and non-industrial streets shall have vertical face curb and gutter with a distance of not less than 24 feet back of curb to back of curb (except as hereafter provided). Vertical face curb shall conform to the specifications contained in the Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development. "Roll-back" curb and gutter is prohibited. If a subdivision development consists of a minimum of three acres per lot, the developer shall not be required to install curb and gutter; provided however, the developer, prior to the commencement of construction shall provide the county engineer with a copy of the recorded plat of said subdivision which shall contain a restrictive covenant, in addition to any other covenants, providing that said lots may not be re-subdivided into smaller lots and an affidavit that upon the conveyance of a lot to a third party, the deed shall specifically contain therein the provision that said lot cannot be re-subdivided into smaller lots not withstanding anything contained herein to the contrary. 
                  (12)  Sidewalks. Except in A-1 or RE Districts, sidewalks, 48 inches wide or greater, shall be constructed along both sides of all streets throughout any subdivision development with an amenity package or on public sewer. An "amenity package" means a clubhouse, swimming pool, tennis courts, playgrounds or any combination of similar facilities, that would encourage residents to walk within the subdivision. Sidewalks shall be required on one side of the street in any other subdivision. Said sidewalks shall be constructed in conformity with the details found in the Bartow County Site and Utility Details for Development. 
                  (13)  Curb for commercial and industrial streets. All commercial and industrial streets shall have six inch by 30 inch vertical face curbs with a distance of not less than 31 feet "back of curb to back of curb." 
                  (14)  As-built certification. The developer's engineer shall, upon completion of roadway construction in compliance with these regulations, cause to be prepared an as-built certification for all roads, streets, and drainage systems for design compliance. A standard form of certification will be provided by the county. 
                  (15)  Deed of dedication. The developer shall, upon completion of the above requirements, cause to be prepared a deed of dedication to Bartow County with a proper legal description, providing for dedication to and acceptance by Bartow County of the roadways and associated infrastructure improvements. Upon acceptance of said road or street, the same shall be open to the general public at all times subject only to any restrictions placed upon it by Bartow County. The county shall not be required to accept the dedication until all criteria of these regulations, including placement of final wearing surface, are met. Acceptance shall only occur by resolution of the commissioner adopted at a public hearing. 
                  (16)  Warranty and maintenance period; requirements. Commercial or industrial roadways (including associated infrastructure improvements) shall be warranted for a period of two years from date of acceptance by the county of the roadways. Non-commercial and non-industrial roadways (including associated infrastructure improvements) shall be warranted for a period of two years from acceptance by the county of the roadways, except for roadways with sanitary sewer, in which case the warranty period shall extend two years from the date of acceptance by the county of the roadways. In all cases, the warranty period begins to run on the date the commissioner accepts the deed of dedication by resolution at a public hearing. The warranty shall mean that if the road fails within the warranty period, the road shall be repaired by the permit holder, or else the county shall draw on the surety to pay for the repair. Road failures include dips in the surface, raveling, potholes, and any other defect that means the road does not meet the standards and regulations of the county, as determined solely by the county. The surety required by subsection 5.28(e) shall remain in effect the applicable warranty period to secure maintenance. Work in an existing county right-of-way (for example, to tie in a new development) shall be warranted for a period of two years. 
                  (Ord. of 11-9-2005(3), § 4.5; Ord. of 9-10-2008, §§ I(4.5.15), II(4.5.16); Ord. of 9-11-2013, § I) 
                  Sec. 5.32. - Storm water drainage facilities. 
                  The following criteria and requirements are applicable to all storm water and drainage plans and facilities, in all developments and subdivisions: 
                  (1)  Professional preparation. A registered professional engineer or landscape architect currently registered in the State of Georgia must design and provide documentation that the proposed storm drainage improvements indicated on the site development plan are adequate and will not adversely impact downstream property owners. Said documentation shall include but not be limited to, storm pipe design calculations for hydraulic design review, calculations to show adequacy of receiving ditch including effects of concentrated discharge and engineer's certificate regarding storm water runoff. 
                  (2)  Connection to existing storm drain required. If a storm drainage sewer system exists in the governmental area, then the proposed development must contain an underground storm drainage system that will be connected to the existing area system. Such system shall be indicated on the plat. 
                  (3)  Provision for stormwater facilities. If an adequate storm drainage sewer system does not exist in the governmental area, then adequate surface drainage facilities, as designed by an engineer or landscape architect and documented by a surveyor currently registered in the State of Georgia, shall be included in the site development plan and so indicated on the plat. 
                  (4)  Standards. Commercial, industrial and residential site development plans shall include storm water management facilities which limit surface water discharge to predevelopment rates for all frequencies from the two-year through the 100-year storm events. All stormwater detention facilities shall contain concrete or pure aluminum pipe. All stormwater detention facilities shall be designed and certified by a professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia. 
                  (5)  Security and access. All ponds proposed to be deeded to the county shall be contained on an "out parcel" and shall have a four-foot high security fence with a 12-foot access gate around the perimeter of the out parcel. A minimum 20-foot wide access ramp must be provided to the facility. Owner/developer shall take precautionary measures to deter children from going near detention ponds. "KEEP OUT" and other warning signs shall be posted. All private stormwater detention facilities shall have a four-foot high security fence around the perimeter of the detention pond, with a 12-foot access gate. Owner/developer shall take precautionary measures to deter children from going near detention ponds. "KEEP OUT" and other warning signs shall be posted. As-built detention pond certification (standard form provided by engineering department) shall be provided by the design engineer to ensure compliance with design. 
                  (6)  Performance standards. In all cases site development plans shall include adequate storm water management facilities which are designed and constructed to avoid any adverse impact on downstream property owners including, without limitation, recorded downstream drainage easements to the county. The "rational method" is not acceptable for stormwater detention design. See the Bartow County Development Checklist for acceptable methods. 
                  (7)  Dedication in single-family subdivisions. The developer of single-family subdivisions shall, upon completion of the above requirements for detention ponds and access easements, cause to be prepared a deed of dedication to the county with a proper legal description, providing for dedication to and acceptance by the county. Upon acceptance of said detention pond, the developer shall warrant the facility for a period of one year after acceptance. 
                  (8)  Indemnification. All developments shall provide an owner's indemnification statement. 
                  (9)  Drainage easements. Where a proposed development is traversed by a water course, drainage way, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a minimum ten feet of storm water easement or drainage right-of-way along each side of the channel or course for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting such drainage easement. Open drainage ditches shall have no greater than 4:1 side slopes and fall entirely within the easement. Proposed ditches within a development shall be maintained and protected by the individual lot owner, unless shown otherwise. Notice of same shall be included on the recorded plat of the development and on each individual deed of conveyance. 
                  (10)  Standards on structures. All drainage systems must utilize drop inlets and/or catch basins constructed to Georgia Department of Transportation standards, unless a drainage study sealed by a professional engineer or landscape architect currently registered in the State of Georgia and approved by the county, indicates the conditions require a different drainage structure. Spillways are prohibited within the right-of-way. All structures not conforming to Georgia Department of Transportation standards must be designed by a registered professional engineer or landscape architect currently registered in the State of Georgia and must be approved by the county. 
                  (11)  Street grading. Street grades must be such that drainage flows away from intersecting streets. Each street shall have low points constructed at a minimum of 12 feet from the edge of the paving on intersecting streets and a minimum of six inches below the edge of the pavement. 
                  (12)  Flood hazard area delineation. Location of 100-year flood hazard area, if any, must be delineated on the plan. FEMA procedures shall be followed in arriving at flood plain determinations and the Bartow County Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance (Code section 34-31 et seq.) shall be complied with. Where encroachment is proposed, an engineer's certificate for flood plains must be provided along with an as-built certification upon construction completion. 
                  (13)  Plat acceptance criteria. Proposed preliminary and final plats of development, both residential and commercial, located contiguous to or within flood hazard areas shall not be accepted, except in accordance with the following requirements: 
                  a.  Base flood elevation. Each plat shall contain a notation clearly stating the water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to mean sea level or as accepted by the engineering department. Any lands below this elevation shall be designated on the plat by a heavy contour-type line, depicting the base flood level and created as a drainage easement. 
                  b.  Individual lot plat and certification. A property plat of each residential lot, any portion thereof which is flooded by the base flood, shall be submitted to the engineering department for review and acceptance prior to issuance of the building permit. Said plat shall have located and noted thereon the building, driveway, setbacks, finished floor elevations (including basement) above base flood, floodplain coverage and elevations, area above base flood elevation, and all easements. All elevations shall be referenced to NGVD (mean sea level) or acceptable datum. Prior to rough inspection, certification of compliance with Bartow County Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance shall be submitted to the engineering department for acceptance. This requirement is applicable to all subdivision lots encumbered by a flood hazard area which are unbuilt and unpermitted as of the February 21, 1996. Base flood is defined in the Bartow County Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance and is to include the pool of stormwater created by the base storm resulting from manmade stormwater drainage structures or constrictions to flow including pipes, culverts, dams, channelizations, etc. 
                  (14)  Flood hazard area kept clear. All owners of any property subject to regulation under these regulations shall maintain all areas on their property within any special flood hazard area free of debris or obstructions which may be hazardous to the public welfare or safety, or which would interfere with the free flow of water in such a way as would increase the need for flood protection, raise the flood level, or increase the risk of hazardous inundation of adjacent properties or developments, as contemplated by these regulations. Where debris or obstructions have accumulated in areas within the base flood contour elevations in such a manner as to interfere with the free flow of water as would increase the need for flood protection, raise the flood level, or increase the risk of hazardous inundation of adjacent properties or jurisdictions, and the owners fail to remedy the problem, upon reasonable notice to the owner, the county is hereby authorized to enter upon such special flood hazard area and clear or remove such debris or obstructions as are hazardous to the public safety. The cost thereof may be charged to the individual or entity causing, creating, or adding to the obstruction, in the judgment of the county. 
                  (15)  Maintenance surety. In accordance with the Bartow County stormwater management ordinance, prior to approval of final plat or issuance of certificate of occupancy, the developer shall cause to be executed in favor of Bartow County surety in the form of a maintenance bond, or an irrevocable standby letter of credit. In lieu of providing a new letter of credit, the developer shall have the option of utilizing funds that would otherwise be released for satisfaction of the E and S requirements in the existing surety, providing the amount meets the requirements of the stormwater management ordinance, and provided the form of the existing surety encompasses the warranty and maintenance obligations contained therein. If the existing surety is not adequate in amount or form for these purposes, the surety must be reissued or a new surety provided. The purpose of the surety shall be for the guarantee of the stormwater management facilities if the developer intends to deed the facilities to the county and the county is agreeable to accept ownership. See subsection 9.4.5 of the stormwater management ordinance.

                  Sec. 5.62. - Off-street parking areas. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose and intent of this section is to ensure the provision of off-street parking, loading, queuing and on-site circulation facilities in proportion to the demand created by each use. By requiring such facilities, it is the intent of this section to ensure the provision of functionally adequate, aesthetically pleasing and safe off-street parking, loading, queuing and circulation areas. It is the intent of this regulation to provide standards for the layout and maintenance of display or parking areas, and to provide space for the use of landscape beautification and natural plant growth for developments where off-street parking and open-lot sales, display and service areas are provided. 
                  (b)  General requirements. The standards of this section shall apply to all new development or existing development that is modified. 
                  (1)  New buildings or a change of use. Off-street parking and loading facilities shall be provided for any new building constructed, for any new use established or any change in occupancy in an existing building. 
                  (2)  Additions and enlargements with no change of use. Off-street parking and loading facilities shall be provided for any addition to or enlargement of an existing building, existing use or existing manner of operation that would result in additional parking and loading spaces being required. The additional parking and loading spaces shall be required only in proportionate amount to the extent of the addition, enlargement, or change, not for the entire building. Renovations or additions to vehicular use areas shall provide landscape improvements in accordance with this section. Existing vegetation shall be preserved and incorporated into the landscaping for the vehicular use area. Creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious surfaces shall meet the requirements of the Bartow County Stormwater Management Ordinance, Ch. 34, Article VIII of the Code of Bartow County. 
                  (c)  Location of required parking. All buildings, structures, and uses of land shall provide, on the same lot with the principal use, off-street parking and loading spaces in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the uses of the land. The location of off-street parking spaces shall not interfere with normal traffic flow or with operation of queuing and backup areas. Loading areas shall not obstruct pedestrian pathways. Each parking space shall be accessible from a driveway and maneuvering and turning areas shall be provided so that no vehicle will be required to back into a public street. 
                  (1)  Adjacent parking lots serving nonresidential or mixed-use buildings shall provide for future interconnectivity. Future interconnectivity provisions for parking lots serving residential development are optional. 
                  (2)  Location on other property. If the required automobile parking spaces cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, such spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby property within a similar zoning district, provided a major portion lies within 400 feet of the main entrance to the principal use for which such parking is provided per the approval of the engineering department. 
                  (d)  Use of required off-street parking areas. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided for the use of residents, customers, patrons, and employees. Required parking spaces shall specifically not be used for the storage, sale or display of goods or materials or for the sale, repair, or servicing of vehicles. All vehicles parked within off-street parking areas shall be registered and operable. Delivery vehicles shall utilize loading areas and not required parking spaces. 
                  (1)  Required off-street parking and loading spaces associated with newly erected or altered buildings or newly established uses of land shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of said building or land so long as the structure or use exists or its use requiring vehicle parking or loading facilities continues. In addition, it shall be unlawful for: 1) said owner to discontinue, change or dispense with, or to cause the discontinuance, or change of the required vehicle parking or loading spaces (apart from the discontinuance, sale or transfer of the building or use) without establishing alternative vehicle parking or loading spaces which meet the requirements of and are in compliance with this ordinance, or 2) any person to use a building or lot without providing vehicle parking or loading spaces which meet the requirements of and are in compliance with this ordinance. 
                  (2)  The maximum number of off-street parking and loading spaces shall be calculated based on the schedule of standards in Table 5.1 of the Development Regulations, maximum off-street parking and loading standards. However, in an effort to reduce the amount of impervious area on developed sites, the actual number of parking and loading spaces constructed shall be determined by the owners' engineer. In any event the minimum number of parking spaces provided shall be no less than 50 percent of the maximum number as identified in Table 5.1. 
                  (3)  Reduced, shared, or off-site parking for single-family residential districts shall be prohibited. For all other districts, the applicant may request an administrative variance for a reduction of parking standards based on the following criteria: 
                  a.  Reduction of parking requirements through a shared parking arrangement may be permissible only through the permission of the engineering department provided the arrangement shall avoid conflicting parking demands and provide for safe pedestrian circulation and access. 
                  b.  Parking plan drawn to scale indicating location of proposed parking spaces shall be provided. 
                  c.  A shared or off-site parking calculation projection shall be provided that demonstrates that each use will have adequate parking provisions at all times. 
                  d.  For contiguous properties sharing parking spaces under this provision, cross easements shall be filed establishing access to the parking spaces in perpetuity. 
                  e.  A reduction in the number of parking spaces that would otherwise be required for each of the various uses on a multiple-use property must be clearly shown on the development plan. If shared or off-site parking is proposed for a combination of contiguous properties, a plan must be submitted covering all of the properties that will be sharing the parking spaces. 
                  f.  A written agreement among all owners of record shall be provided and held on file with the engineering department. 
                  (4)  For any use not listed in Table 5.1, the standards for the most similar use shall be applied. The engineering department shall determine the proper required maximum number of spaces by classifying the use among the uses specified. In making a determination, any evidence of actual parking and loading demands shall be considered as well as other reliable traffic engineering and planning information that is available to ensure sufficient parking and loading spaces are provided to meet the needs caused by the uses of the land. If the number of parking and loading spaces are less than the maximum number calculated in Table 5.1, the owner shall reserve area on the site which will provide for the installation of additional spaces up to the maximum number. The reserve area shall be accessible from the driveway serving the constructed parking area. In the interim, the reserved parking site shall remain a grassed landscaped area. Based on accident reports, traffic studies, and other information related to the development, the engineering department may require the owner to install additional parking spaces to ensure public safety. If it is deemed by the engineering department that adequate parking has not been provided to serve the particular land use, additional parking shall be installed no later than 90 days from the date of official notice from the engineering department. Enforcement procedures shall be as provided in these regulations. The cost for the installation of additional parking and/or associated traffic studies, required by the engineering department, shall be born by the owner. 
                  (5)  Stormwater quality and quantity requirements of the Bartow County Stormwater Management Ordinance, Ch. 34, Art. VIII of the Code of Bartow County, shall be satisfied for all parking areas. Additional parking spaces, which exceed the maximum number calculated in Table 5.1, shall be constructed to allow the infiltration of stormwater by utilizing a permeable typical section with a pervious surface course. The pervious typical section and surface shall be designed in accordance with the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. Striping and/or curbing may be excluded in the overflow parking area upon review and approval by the engineering department. The type of pervious material, conditions of the property, and the type of land use shall be considered in the decision to exclude the striping and/or curbing. 
                  (6)  The maximum designated parking areas, constructed parking areas, and overflow parking areas, if applicable, shall be denoted on the approved construction plan and the approved final "as-built" as shown in Figure 5-1. 
                  a.  Off street parking and loading spaces shall be provided in accordance with the following schedule of standards in Table 5.1.

                  Off-street parking associated with such uses shall be governed by such requirements within these development regulations. Landscaped areas shall be provided and maintained around the perimeter and within the area used for parking, loading or open-lot sales as set forth hereinafter; and concrete curbs of a design approved by the engineering department shall be installed around the perimeter of all landscaped areas. Consideration will be given to alternate designs when islands are used for stormwater management to assist in achieving water quality/quantity requirements. 
                  (b)  Landscape plan submission. The applicant shall submit to the engineering department five sets of construction plans depicting the layout and design of the proposed off-street parking, loading and/or open lot sale area, hereinafter identified as the "vehicular use area." Said plan depicting the layout and design of the proposed vehicular use area shall provide the information required for a predevelopment site plan as set forth in section 5.62 of the development regulations. 
                  The plan shall be submitted and approved as part of the construction plan as required by the provisions of these regulations and the Bartow County Stormwater Management Ordinance. The plan shall show lot or parcel dimensions, building dimensions, tree/landscape preservation areas, and the location and size of all tree and plant materials. All landscape plans must be prepared and stamped by a registered landscape architect licensed to practice in the State of Georgia and should follow the general landscape principles of preservation, creativity, quality and an emphasis should be placed on the use of Xeriscape. 
                  (c)  General requirements. Plan submission and required landscaping features for vehicular use areas. 
                  (1)  The areas used for the display or parking of any and all types of vehicles, boats or heavy construction equipment, whether such vehicles, boats or equipment are self-propelled or not, and all land upon which vehicles traverse the property as a function of the primary use, hereinafter referred to as "other vehicular uses," including but not limited to activities of a drive-in nature such as, but not limited to, filling stations, grocery and dairy stores, banks, restaurants, and the like, shall conform to the minimum landscaping requirements hereinafter provided, except areas used for parking or other vehicular uses under, on or within buildings, and parking areas serving single-and two-family uses as normally such residential areas are voluntarily landscaped. 
                  (d)  Landscaping requirements. All vehicular use areas shall comply with the following landscaping requirements: 
                  (1)  Perimeter landscape requirements. All building perimeters shall have a landscape area or sidewalk of not less than five feet in width. In no case shall asphalt paving areas be contiguous to the base of a building. All exterior perimeters of all vehicular use areas shall have a perimeter landscaped area with no horizontal dimension less than five feet. A minimum of one tree for every 75 linear feet of perimeter area shall be required. A decorative masonry wall, earth berm, natural landscaping screen, new plantings, or some combination of these elements shall be installed in such a manner as to partially screen the vehicular use area from adjacent properties. Such screening shall be maintained at a minimum height of three feet. In no case shall these requirements be interrupted to allow an obstruction of site distance. See corner visibility requirement in subsection (2) below. 
                  (2)  Street landscape requirements. When abutting a public street right-of-way, landscaping areas shall have a minimum dimension of ten feet from the right-of-way line to the vehicular use area. A minimum of one tree for every 30 linear feet of road frontage area (minimum two trees) shall be required. If a parcel or lot has more than one street planting area (i.e. more than one street frontage), each shall be considered separately. If a building site contains more than one parcel or lot, the entire site shall be treated as a single entity. Forty percent of the street planting area shall be comprised of shrub materials. 
                  Signs may be placed within the street planting area, monument style, and placed at least ten horizontal feet from all property lines, or one foot behind right-of-way for every foot of height, whichever is greater. No sign or planting shall be erected that obstructs sight distance at an intersection or along a public right-of-way. In all zoning districts, no sign of any type or design that obstructs vision between the heights of three feet and 15 feet above grade shall be permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of street and/or railroads. Traffic control signs and signals are exempt from this regulation. 
                  In addition, the requirements for corner visibility must be met as follows: There shall be provided an unobstructed view across the triangle formed by joining points measured 20 feet distant along the property line from the intersection of two streets or 20 feet along both the street and alley line from the intersection of a street and an alley. Within said triangle there shall be no sight-obscuring wall, fence or foliage higher than 30 inches above grade or, in the case of trees, foliage lower than eight feet. Vertical measurement shall be made at the top of the curb on the street or alley adjacent to the nearest side of the triangle, or, if no curb exists, from the edge of the nearest traveled way. See Bartow County Zoning Ordinance, Appendix A of the Code of Bartow County, for additional sign regulations. 
                  (3)  Mandatory terminal island design. Each single and double row of parking spaces shall be terminated by landscaped islands contoured as indicated in the diagram below or approved similar design. A terminal island shall be no less than nine feet in width and no less than 15 feet in length and shall include at least one tree having a clear trunk of at least five feet, with the remaining area adequately landscaped with shrubs, ground cover or other authorized landscaping material not to exceed three feet in height. Larger islands should be considered for planting of larger-maturing trees. At the discretion of the County Engineer this requirement may be varied to allow for an alternate design for large truck storage lots with additional perimeter landscaping in lieu of terminal islands with landscaping. 
                  (4)  Mandatory interior island design. Interior landscaped islands shall be provided within each row of parking spaces and contoured as indicated in the diagram below. A minimum of one interior island shall be provided for every 15 parking spaces or fraction thereof. Landscaped interior islands shall measure not less than nine feet in width. The length of the interior islands shall be no less than the minimum required depth of parking space. Landscape strips a minimum of five feet in width shall be provided for every other interior-parking isle. Larger islands should be considered for planting of larger-maturing trees. At the discretion of the County Engineer this requirement may be varied to allow for an alternate design for large truck storage lots and student parking areas with additional perimeter and/or terminal-island landscaping in lieu of interior islands with landscaping. 

                  (5)  The perimeter of terminal islands and interior islands shall be surrounded with a continuous, raised curb. Exemptions include those landscaped islands intended for stormwater retention/detention. See Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for additional requirements regarding stormwater management. Landscape island width shall be measured from the inside edge of the curb. Trees planted in vehicular use areas shall be allowed to grow to a mature height and a full canopy. Pruning shall be limited to periodic trimmings to maintain the health of the trees or shrubs. 
                  (6)  Minimum landscape installation requirements. All landscaping shall be installed in accordance with accepted good planting procedures. 
                  (7)  Tree protection. During development of any project there shall be erected and maintained suitable protective barriers around all trees to be retained so as to prevent damage thereto. All building materials, soil stockpiles or other debris shall be kept outside the barriers. There shall be no paving with any impervious materials or grading within 15 feet of any tree to be retained. 
                  (e)  New plant materials. All new living plant materials shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (a) or better as defined in the most current edition of Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants. 
                  (1)  Xeriscape requirements. All street frontage, parking lot, and side yard landscape areas shall be planted with water-conserving groundcover and vegetation. Other conservation measures are encouraged, including: 
                  a.  Irrigation systems which are electronically set for night and/or early morning irrigation; 
                  b.  Designs which collect and recycle water; and 
                  c.  The minimization of overspray onto non-landscaped areas to avoid wasting water. 
                  (2)  All separate landscaped areas shall have a minimum variety of two living plant materials. 
                  (3)  Paving (other than walks) and artificial plants shall not be permitted within landscaping areas. 
                  (4)  Trees. A tree shall attain an average crown spread over 15 feet at maturity. Trees having an average crown spread less than 15 feet may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a 15-foot crown spread. All trees shall be of a species which can be maintained with a minimum of five feet of trunk height.

                  Certificate of compliance. All landscaping for each phase of development shall be completed prior to the recording of the final plat for that phase or prior to the issuance of certificate of occupancy for that phase. Upon completion of the landscape improvements, the site shall be inspected by the engineering department for compliance with the approved landscape plan. A certificate of compliance certified by the design professional who prepared the plan must be submitted and accepted the by engineering department before a certificate of occupancy can be issued for any related structures. 
                  In the event that the requirements of this article have not been met at the time that a certificate of occupancy could otherwise be granted in the case of an undue hardship or circumstances beyond the owner/developer's control, the owner or his agent shall post a landscape performance bond, letter of credit or other county approved surety in the amount equal to 100 percent of the cost of materials, labor, and other attendant costs, incidental to the installation of the required landscaping. Said surety shall be drawn in favor of Bartow County, be in a form satisfactory to the county, and specify the time for the completion of the landscaping requirements of this article which shall not be longer than six months following the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy. 
                  (m)  Lot remnant plantings. All land surfaces other than those that are covered by buildings, structures, paving, or other required site elements shall be landscaped with well maintained grass, flowers, shrubs, or other suitable plant materials approved by the engineering department.

An undisturbed vegetative buffer is required for any watercourse, river or stream shown on a 7.5 degree quadrangle map (1:24,000 scale) United States Geological Survey map most recently published, or on any other official U.S. Geological Survey map. Such buffer is to be a minimum of 50 feet on each side of the river or stream, as measured horizontally either from the top of the stream bank, or from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, whichever provides a larger buffer. Access points to the stream for livestock watering shall be allowed, but must be constructed following best management practices (BMPs) to minimize pollution and sedimentation to the stream or river. Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) regulations should also be consulted. 
                  (b)  Setback buffer. A further 25-foot setback buffer is imposed outside the 50-foot buffer; in the setback buffer, no impervious surfaces (including driveways, walkways, patios, other paving, etc.), nor septic tanks, septic drain fields or similar disposal systems, may be placed. Grading, filling, and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback buffer. Any unauthorized disturbance of the buffer during construction must be restored to a vegetative density similar to the adjacent buffer areas, and also constitutes a violation of these regulations. Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) regulations should also be consulted. 
                  (c)  Applications. Any permit applications for property requiring buffers and setback buffers under this section must include all information requested by the county engineer to insure compliance with this section, with the following as a minimum: a site plan showing: the location of all streams on the property, the limits of required stream buffers and setbacks on the property, buffer zone topography with contour lines at no greater than five-foot contour intervals; delineation of forested and open areas in the buffer zone, and detailed plans of all proposed land development in the buffer and of all proposed impervious cover within the setback. Additionally, a description of all proposed land development within the buffer and setback is required. 
                  (d)  Variances. Variances shall be granted under Article V. Additional provisions apply to variances from stream buffers, as contained therein. Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) regulations should also be consulted.

                  Sec. 5.126. - Board of appeals. 
                  The board of appeals, as established by the Bartow County Zoning Ordinance, shall be empowered to hear appeals of interpretations of the county engineer under these regulations, and to hear applications for variances from the requirements of these regulations. Its proceedings and procedure shall follow the procedure and requirements as stated in the Bartow County Zoning Ordinance regarding notice, hearing procedure and other matters not covered herein. 
                  (Ord. of 11-9-2005(3), § 7.1) 
                  Sec. 5.127. - Appeals. 
                  The board of appeals shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the county engineer in the enforcement of these regulations. Appeals to the board of appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of Bartow County affected by any decision of the county engineer. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days of said decision by filing with the county engineer a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. Decisions on appeals shall be issued in writing within ten days of the appeal. 
                  (Ord. of 11-9-2005(3), § 7.2) 
                  Sec. 5.128. - Variances. 
                  (a)  Variances. The board of appeals has the power to hear requests for variances from the provisions of these regulations. Variance may be granted only if the board finds all of the following to exist: 
                  (1)  That one of the following is true, through no action or fault of the property owner or predecessor: 
                  a.  The property is exceptionally narrow, shallow or unusually shaped; 
                  b.  The property contains exceptional topographic conditions; 
                  c.  The property contains other extraordinary or exceptional conditions; or 
                  d.  There are existing other extraordinary or exceptional circumstances; and 
                  (2)  That the strict application of the requirements of these regulations would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the owner of this property; and 
                  (3)  That the requested variance relief may be granted without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of these regulations. 
                  Variance decisions shall be issued in writing within ten days of the hearing. 
                  (b)  Conditions. In granting a variance, the board of appeals may attach such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable so that the purpose of these regulations will be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. 
                  (c)  Limitations. The board of appeals shall not be authorized to grant a density variance or a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited. The board shall not grant variances when the hardship was created by the property owner or his predecessor, and shall not grant hardship variances based on shape or topography for lots of record not existing prior to February 21, 1996. Configuring a subdivision to create lots that are difficult to build is an example of a hardship created by the property owner or processor, that do not justify a variance. 
                  (d)  Special stream buffer provisions. If the variance is related to section 64-65 stream buffers, variances will only be considered when a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing as of April 30, 2004 prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted, or if unusual circumstances exist wherein strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirement of that section would create extreme hardship. Variances will not be considered when actions of the property owner have created the conditions of hardship on the property. Variances may be conditioned or limited to serve the purposes of this chapter, and only the minimum variance necessary shall be given. 
                  (e)  Special stream buffer application requirements. If the variance is related to section 64-65 stream buffers, the application shall contain the following information, and other information as required by the county engineer: 
                  (1)  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
                  (2)  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  (3)  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
                  (4)  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
                  (5)  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
                  (6)  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
                  (7)  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and, 
                  (8)  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
