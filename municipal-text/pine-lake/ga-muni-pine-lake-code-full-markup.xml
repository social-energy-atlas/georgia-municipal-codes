PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Pine Lake, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1986 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice President, Supplement Department and Janet Cramer, Editor, Kayla Jewell, Proofreader, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Valerie Caldwell, City Administrator, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

            <p>PART I - CHARTER[1]                   Footnotes: 
                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Part I of this volume is the Charter of the City, as adopted by 1991 Ga. Laws (Act No. 121), page 3935. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Any material in brackets has been added for purposes of clarity. At the end of each section appears a historical note reference to amendatory Acts, if any. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the base act. The editor has added section numbers and catchlines to facilitate use of this compilation and indexing; however, formal citations should be to the original act, and not to this compilation. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform, and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used.

Const. art. 1, § 2, ¶ 2. 
                  (d)  The people have a right to expect that every public official will conduct himself or herself in a manner that will tend to preserve public confidence in and respect for the government he or she represents.

                  (1)  To encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials; 
                  (2)  To establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the city;

                  Sec. 6-1. - Purpose of article. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses; the adverse affect on property values and on the public health, safety and welfare of the city; on its citizens and property; and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This chapter is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. This chapter is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. This chapter is not intended to allow or license any business establishment or activity which would otherwise be unlawful.

                  Sec. 6-4. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  Based on the concerns of several citizens within the city and surrounding community, on April 27, 2004, the mayor announced the development of a community based ordinance restricting adult theme commercial establishments. The initiative was announced in local newspapers, e-mail, and newsletters through the PLAIN newsletter in "Notes from City Hall," during a town hall meeting, and publicly discussed on April 27, May 10, May 25, and a public hearing was held on June 14 for the final discussion. 
                  (b)  Based on the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Atlanta, Georgia; Fulton County, Georgia; and DeKalb County, Georgia; which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the city, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the governing authority that adult entertainment, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called nude bars or establishments offering so-called nude entertainment or adult entertainment, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, drug trafficking and drug use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this section, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Furthermore, the public health, safety and welfare require that adult entertainment establishments and their locations, operations and employees be regulated and licensed in order to reduce the potential for harm and in order to preserve the quality of urban life in residential and business areas of the community. Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the city is in the public welfare, and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

                  Sec. 18-5. - Building permits and certificates of occupancy. 
                  (a)  No new construction, or renovations shall be made without first obtaining a building permit from the city and second, by obtaining a permit from the county development department. The city clerk will issue permits for all new construction or renovations, only after approval and signature of the mayor or the mayors' duly assigned agent using the requirements listed below. Upon completion, no person shall occupy a new construction or renovation without first obtaining an occupancy permit from the city and, second, by obtaining an additional and final occupancy permit from the county development department. The city clerk shall issue occupancy permits from the city, only after the approval and signature of the mayor or the mayors duly assigned agent. The county development department shall not issue a building permit or an occupancy permit until the city has first issued a building permit or occupancy permit. No building permit or occupancy permit shall be issued by the city unless all building ordinances as adopted by the city and the county have been fully complied with. 
                  (b)  The following regulations apply to both new construction and renovations: 
                  (1)  The basic building permit fee is $100.00 plus an administration fee, calculated as follows: 
                  a.  For replacing, improving, modifying or increasing buildings that are currently being taxed, the administration fee will be calculated as 0.4 percent of the good faith estimated costs of renovation. 
                  b.  For new buildings, the administration fee will be calculated as 0.8 percent of sold price. Said construction will require a $1,000.00 deposit per unit before construction and the balance due to the city or to the developer will be reconciled upon closing. 
                  c.  Upon approval of all final inspections, a certificate of occupancy will be issued for a fee of $75.00. Occupancy of any new or renovated structure without a certificate is prohibited. 
                  (2)  All applications for building permits must include the following: 
                  a.  To-scale site plan showing dimensions of all side boundaries and major trees six inches and over in diameter that will be removed and showing all setbacks and proposed construction; plus existing and proposed structures. 
                  b.  1.  All new business construction will include pedestrian access via sidewalks or approved trails. All builders will provide pedestrian trails in accordance with accessibility requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. 
                  2.  Sidewalks or trails will interconnect businesses. 
                  3.  Sidewalks or trails will be a minimum of 60 inches wide, will be at a grade less than eight degrees except where prohibited by topography, and will not include turns with a radius less than four feet. 
                  4.  Sidewalks or trails will allow access to the street in at least one place along the property line. 
                  c.  1.  All new construction along the corridors zoned as professional or commercial business will include proper curbing to separate the pedestrian areas from vehicular traffic. 
                  2.  Curbing will be constructed along the roadway and may include an entrance lane arc. 
                  3.  Curbing may be constructed by concrete or stone. 
                  4.  Curbing will be a minimum of four inches wide and six inches above road bed. 
                  d.  Silt control and drainage plan. Silt control and drainage measures will be in place prior to construction and maintained throughout project. On completion of project, lawn must be sodded, seeded or have other means of ground cover for erosion prevention; and 
                  e.  A signed waiver that builder is responsible for all damage to city property such as curbing, sidewalks and streets and shall be repaired to the original state. 
                  (3)  All county inspections must be made and approved by the county. 
                  (4)  Upon completion of construction a city certificate of occupancy is required after all of the above requirements have been met. No occupancy is allowed prior to the issuance of this certificate. 
                  (5)  Enforcement of regulations. The city administrator or his/her designee will inspect the property three times during the course of the project. First inspection prior to construction to verify accuracy of site plan, second visit prior to permanent installation of foundation, and third prior to issuance of city certificate of occupancy to ensure that construction is as per planned. The city administrator or designee is empowered to issue citations for violations of the above regulations. Failure to institute immediate corrective measures will result in work stoppage and citations for repeated infractions. 
                  (6)  Stormwater run-off. 
                  a.  All builders will minimize the long-term impact of stormwater run-off produced as a result of their construction. This section applies to all new construction and does not replace subsection (b)(3)d of this section. 
                  b.  The effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived was June 9, 2003. 
                  c.  New construction will not intentionally divert untreated stormwater from parking areas onto the street. 
                  d.  Construction plans will yield less than one gallon (or 0.1556 cubic feet) of surface water runoff according to engineering calculations for a peak rain event of six inches (0.5 feet) per hour. Builders will calculate the stormwater impact of all proposed new construction. The calculation will take into account the impermeability of engineered surface areas as well as the water retainability of natural and engineered retention features. The net stormwater impact is the volume of runoff water calculated by subtraction the lot's ability to absorb water by the stormwater produced by a building or paving (covering), given as: 
                  New stormwater = (lot's ability to absorb) - (construction's stormwater production) 
                  e.  The construction's stormwater impact will be calculated by multiplying the area of each covered portion by the associated impermeability factors by a rain rate of 0.51 feet an hour. Then, subtract from that subtotal the number of gallons credited for those features which absorb or retain water. 
                  f.  Proposed calculations will assume the following: 
                  1.  Each 6,000 square foot plot will be credited with the ability to retain 2,571 gallons of water; 
                  2.  Each tree less than 12 inches in width (at breast height) provides a credit of ten gallon per inch. Each tree thicker than 12 inches provides a credit of 20 gallons per inch; 
                  3.  Horizontally projected roofline (shadow) will create 3.21 gallons per square foot; 
                  4.  Concrete or asphalt surfaces will create 2.89 gallons per square foot; 
                  5.  Crush-and-run gravel will create 0.640 gallons per square foot; 
                  6.  Brick, stone or concrete pavers will create 0.963 gallons per square foot; 
                  7.  Uncovered wooden decks with spaces greater than 0.5 inches will not produce stormwater; decks of other materials and with spaces smaller that 0.5 inches will create 0.640 to 0.963 gallons per square foot; 
                  8.  Water features (like ponds) will be credited with 16.05 gallons per square foot; 
                  9.  Earthen swales with large rocks will be credited with 2.25 gallons per cubic foot; 
                  10.  Drywells or concrete stormwater retention ponds will provide a credit of 6.42 gallons per cubic foot. 
                  g.  Calculations will be done by addressing each subtotal as illustrated in the following example: 

                   
                  (7)  This section is constructed to minimize floodplain impact of stormwater by requiring design measures to retain and pretreat stormwater on site prior to its impact to city and county lakes and streams. 
                  a.  All builders will minimize the impact of their construction on and to the floodplains of the city. This section applies to all new construction and does not replace subsection (b)(3)d of this section and is intended to enhance subsection (b)(7) of this section. 
                  b.  New construction will not intentionally divert untreated stormwater from parking areas into the creeks and streams. 
                  c.  The stormwater makeup requirements will be doubled: That is, the builders will have to create twice the stormwater credits proposed in subsection (b)(7) of this section to make up for the amount of water displaced. Therefore, builders will calculate the stormwater impact of all proposed new construction as follows: Net stormwater plus a lots ability to absorb minus construction stormwater productions equals two. Therefore, the specific values outlined in subsection (b)(7) of this section that provide a credit in the lot-specific folding calculation, will only provide half the credit for those developments in the floodplain. 
                  1.  Example inside the floodplain: 
                  (i)  Single 6,000 square foot lot: -1,285.8 gallons. 
                  (ii)  Six trees at four inches (×10) plus four trees at six inches (×-10): -240 gallons. 
                  2.  Example outside the floodplain: 
                  (i)  Single 6,000 square foot lot: -2,571 gallons. 
                  (ii)  Six trees at four inches (×10) plus four inches at six inches (×10): -480 gallons. 
                  (8)  Penalties. 
                  a.  For the first infraction: stoppage of further work until the infraction is corrected. 
                  b.  For any additional infractions: stoppage of further work until the infraction is corrected and a citation to the court is issued.

For the purposes of clarity, the footnotes were relocated to this editorial note and may be referenced to their original location by the section number that appears following the relevant information. [FN1—18-5(b)e] The values listed in this ordinance reflect the ability of each feature to transmit or absorb water and further adjusted to reflect aesthetic characteristics of the feature (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(e)). [FN2—18-5(b)f.1] A property is assumed to absorb the runoff of an 800 square foot house (800 square foot x 0.5 ft/hr= 400 cubic feet = 2571 gallons)(Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)1). [FN3—18-5(b)f.2] Trees are measured at breast height (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)2). [FN4—18-5(b)f.3] Roofs have an impermeability factor of 1.0 and each 1 square feet of roof creates 0.5 cubic feet of water (1 square foot x 0.5/ feet per hour = 0.5 cubic foot (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)3). [FN5—18-5(b)f.4] Consideration to reduce this factor will be given for innovative means to create means to allow for water to percolate into the soil (as with discontinuous paving) (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)4). [FN6—18-5(b)f.4] Paved surfaces have an impermeability factor of 0.9 (or 90% of that of the roof) (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)4). [FN7—18-5(b)f.5] Grave; surfaces have an impermeability factor of 0.2 (or 20% of that of the roof) (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)5). [FN8—18-5(b)f.6] Other materials will be assigned a value by the city of agent thereof within a range of 0.8-0.4 (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)6). [FN9—18-5(b)f.6] These materials are assigned an impermeability factor of 0.3 (30% of that of the roof) (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)6). [FN10—18-5(b)f.8] Theses features are assigned an impermeability factor of -2.5 (a credit) (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)8). [FN11—18-5(b)f.9] These features are assigned an impermeability factor of -0.7 (a credit) (Code 1986, § 6-2-6(7)(f)9). [FN12—18-5(b)f.10] These features are assigned an impermeability factor of -1.0 ( a credit of volume equal to its holding capacity).

                  Sec. 22-20. - Findings. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Discharges to the city separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (2)  These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments; 
                  (3)  These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters; 
                  (4)  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (5)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city separate storm sewer system; 
                  (6)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system. 
                  Therefore, the city adopts this article to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the (municipal/county) separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the (municipal/county) separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

                  ARTICLE III. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

                  Sec. 22-54. - Findings. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  (2)  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (3)  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (4)  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The state greenspace program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  (5)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
                  (6)  Therefore, the city has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. The city has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff.

                  Sec. 22-55. - Purpose; applicability. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain or improve the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
                  (b)  Applicability. 
                  (1)  This article shall be applicable to all land development including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
                  a.  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
                  b.  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
                  c.  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the director of administration to be a hotspot land use; or 
                  d.  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in subsections (b)(1)a and b of this section if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  (2)  The following activities are exempt from this article: 
                  a.  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
                  b.  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
                  c.  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
                  d.  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the director of administration. 
                  (c)  Designation of ordinance administrator. The director of administration or his or her appointed designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
                  (d)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (e)  Stormwater design manual.

                  ARTICLE IV. - OPEN SPACE DEVELOPMENT 

                  Sec. 22-79. - Purposes. 
                  The purposes of the open space development are as follows: 
                  (1)  To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure. 
                  (2)  To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land. 
                  (3)  To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat. 
                  (4)  To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development. 
                  (5)  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development. 
                  (6)  To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community. 
                  (7)  To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions. 
                  (8)  To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood. 
                  (9)  To encourage street designs that reduces traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries. 
                  (10)  To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the city and connected to neighboring communities, businesses and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles. 
                  (11)  To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space. 
                  (l2)  To preserve important historic and archaeological sites. 
                  (Code 1986, § 6-1-14B(1)) 
                  Sec. 22-80. - General regulations. 
                  (a)  Applicability of regulations. This conservation of open space option is available on all properties zoned residential in the city as a use by right. Applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the zoning code and all other applicable laws, except those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein. 
                  (b)  Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility. 
                  (c)  Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in the subdivision shall be determined, at the discretion of the local jurisdiction, by either of the following two methods: 
                  (1)  Calculation. The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel: 
                  a.  Slopes over 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area; 
                  b.  The 100-year floodplain; 
                  c.  Bodies of open water over 5,000 square feet contiguous area; 
                  d.  Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act ("Federal Water Pollution Control Act" 33 USC 1251 et seq.); or 
                  e.  Anticipated right-of-way needs for roads and utilities. 
                  (2)  Yield plan. The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional city design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations.

A suspended, revoked or modified permit may be reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated (upon such conditions as the city may deem necessary) to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations. 
                  d.  Civil penalties. In the event the applicant or other responsible person fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within ten days, or such greater period as the city shall deem appropriate (except that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24 hours notice shall be sufficient), after the city has taken one or more of the actions described above, the city may impose a penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. 
                  e.  Criminal penalties. For intentional and flagrant violations of this article, the city may issue a citation to the applicant or other responsible person, requiring such person to appear in city magistrate court to answer charges for such violation. Upon conviction, such person shall be punished as provided by section 1-9. Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense.

                  Sec. 22-112. - Applicability. 
                  (a)  This article shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area as defined in section 22-110. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations. 
                  (1)  Grandfather provisions. This article shall not apply to the following activities: 
                  a.  Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
                  b.  Existing development and ongoing land disturbance activities including but not limited to existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements. 
                  c.  Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
                  d.  Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as for an office park or other phased development that has been previously approved within two years of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
                  (2)  Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this article. 
                  a.  Activities for the purpose of building one of the following: 
                  1.  A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line; 
                  2.  Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures; 
                  3.  Intrusions necessary to provide access to a property; 
                  4.  Public access facilities that must be on the water including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the river, fishing platforms and overlooks; 
                  5.  Unpaved foot trails and paths; 
                  6.  Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used. 
                  b.  Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least 25 feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in subsection (b)a of this section. 
                  c.  Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time this article takes effect or approved under the terms of this article. 
                  d.  Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this article takes effect or approved under the terms of this article, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve structures. 
                  e.  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the city on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the city to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area. 
                  f.  Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer. 
                  Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property. 
                  (b)  After the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, it shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities. Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to section 22-113(b). 
                  (Code 1986, § 6-1-14C(4)) 
                  Sec. 22-113. - Land development requirements. 
                  (a)  Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. 
                  (2)  An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 
                  (3)  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
                  (b)  Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the city finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the city council may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
                  (2)  Except as provided above, the city council shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the council. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
                  b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in this article would create an extreme hardship. 
                  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  (3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
                  a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
                  b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
                  d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
                  e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
                  f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
                  g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
                  h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
                  (4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
                  a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
                  c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
                  d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
                  e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
                  f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

                  Sec. 22-117. - Inspection. 
                  (a)  The city may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work. The permittee shall assist the city in making such inspections. The city shall have the authority to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land development activities within the protection area. 
                  (b)  No person shall refuse entry or access to city administrator and any authorized representative or agent who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative in the process of carrying out official duties.

                  ARTICLE VI. - LITTER CONTROL 

                  Sec. 22-151. - Findings. 
                  Litter found throughout our community often finds its way into our streams, rivers and lakes and detracts from our quality of life. Pollutants carried into our streams, rivers and lakes by litter, diminish the quality of our water and its aquatic resources. Litter control ordinances provide a prohibition against littering and provide an enforcement mechanism with penalties for dealing with those found littering.

                  Sec. 22-152. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation and prevention of litter. The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  Provide for uniform prohibition throughout the city of any and all littering on public or private property; and 
                  (2)  Prevent the desecration of the beauty and quality of life of the city and prevent harm to the public health, safety, environment and general welfare, including the degradation of water and aquatic resources caused by litter.

                  (a)  Violations. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this article. Any person who has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this article, may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or may be restrained by injunction or otherwise sentenced in a manner provided by law. 
                  (b)  Evidence. 
                  (1)  Whenever litter is thrown, deposited, dropped or dumped from any motor vehicle, boat, airplane or other conveyance in violation of this article, it shall be prima facie evidence that the operator of the conveyance has violated this article. 
                  (2)  Except as provided in subsection (b)(1) of this section, whenever any litter which is dumped, deposited, thrown or left on public or private property in violation of this article is discovered to contain any article, including but not limited to letters, bills, publications or other writing which display the name of the person thereon in such a manner as to indicate that the article belongs or belonged to such person, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that such person has violated this article. 
                  (c)  Penalties. Any person who violates this article shall be guilty of a violation and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as follows: 
                  (1)  As provided by section 1-9; 
                  (2)  In addition to the fine set out in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the violator shall reimburse the city for the reasonable cost of removing the litter when the litter is or is ordered removed by the city; and 
                  (3)  a.  In the sound discretion of the court, the person may be directed to pick up and remove from any public street or highway or public right-of-way for a distance not to exceed one mile any litter he or she has deposited and any and all litter deposited thereon by anyone else prior to the date of execution of sentence; or 
                  b.  In the sound discretion of the court, the person may be directed to pick up and remove any and all litter from any public property, private right-of-way, or with prior permission of the legal owner or tenant in lawful possession of such property, any private property upon which it can be established by competent evidence that he or she has deposited litter. Pick up and removal shall include any and all litter deposited thereon by anyone prior to the date of execution of sentence; and

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (2) --- 
                  State Law reference— Minimum standards and procedures to protect natural resources, environment, vital areas, wetlands, O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8. 

                  Sec. 22-184. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  (2)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (3)  It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (b)  Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the "Wetland Protection Ordinance of the City of Pine Lake, Georgia." The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological and economical development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
                  (Code 1986, § 6-1-17(1)) 
                  Sec. 22-185. - Wetland protection district. 
                  (a)  Generalized wetland map. The generalized wetland map of the city is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated as a part of this article as if fully set out herein. It is a general reference document and applies to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the city. The generalized wetland map shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the city clerk. 
                  (b)  Boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act ("Federal Water Pollution Control Act" 33 USC 1251 et seq.), as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (c)  Relationship to zoning. The wetland protection district is hereby established. The wetland protection district shall comprise an overlay zone that supplements and is indicated on the city zoning map, which is hereby incorporated and made part of this article by reference. When the two conflict, the more restrictive provisions shall apply.

                  Sec. 22-186. - Local development permits. 
                  (a)  Requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the city in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (b) of this section or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit.

                  1.  Surface mining, as the same is defined in O.C.G.A. 12-4-72, "The Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968". 
                  2.  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying; 
                  3.  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
                  4.  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one (1) acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the Director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the Local Issuing Authority; 
                  5.  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. 1-3-3, "definitions", to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds; 
                  6.  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in paragraphs (15) and (16) of Section 22-226.C. of this article, no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three (3) years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  7.  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  8.  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this paragraph, "State Waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Local Issuing Authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 or 10 of this section; 
                  9.  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the Department of Transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the State Road and Tollway Authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the Department of Transportation or the State Road and Tollway Authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7.1; except where the Department of Transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the State Road and Tollway Authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the Local Issuing Authority, the Local Issuing Authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  10.  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United states engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the Local Issuing Authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and

                  (04-2012, § III, 11-12-2012) 
                  Sec. 22-226. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using Best Management Practices. 
                  A.  General Provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Section 22-226.B. and C. of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit. 
                  B.  Minimum Requirements/BMPs. 
                  1.  Best management practices as set forth in Section 22-226.B.and C. of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  2.  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
                  3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  4.  The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  5.  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in C.15. and 16., in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  C.  Additional Requirements. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  1.  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  2.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  11.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  13.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  14.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section 22-226.B.2. of this article; 
                  15.  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  16.  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  D.  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any Local Issuing Authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Section 22-226.B. and C. of this article. 
                  E.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (04-2012, § IV, 11-12-2012) 
                  Sec. 22-227. - Application/permit process. 
                  A.  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The Local Issuing Authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  B.  Application Requirements. 
                  1.  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Pine Lake, GA without first obtaining a permit from the City of Pine Lake to perform such activity and providing a copy of Notice of Intent submitted to EPD, as applicable. 
                  2.  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City Manager or his/her designee and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in Section 22-227.C. of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Section 22-226.B. and C. of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by up to six copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. Additional copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans may also be submitted directly to EPD, as specified by the City of Pine Lake. 
                  3.  The City of Pine Lake assesses local permitting fees and also state-mandated fees. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. Except as otherwise provided for herein, fees for an application for a permit on a per-acre of land disturbed basis, as required by this article, shall be as established by the City of Pine Lake from time to time by resolution of the City Council. In addition to the local permitting fees, state-mandated fees shall also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), and regulations adopted thereunder by EPD, in the amount of $80.00 per disturbed acre, to be divided as follows: $40.00 per acre to Bartow County and $40.00 per acre to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. In the case of a subdivision or other larger common plan of development or sale, "per disturbed acre" includes all acreage to be disturbed in the entire development. Fees for the county shall be submitted to the county including primary and secondary permittees. Fees for the state shall be submitted to the state on EPD forms available at http://www.gaepd.org. However, any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division. 
                  4.  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the City of Pine Lake shall refer the application and plan to the District for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The District shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the District to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the District review shall be forwarded to the City of Pine Lake. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, and any variances required by Section 22-226.C. 15. and 16. has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per Section 22-227.B.6., have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the City of Pine Lake and the District enter into an agreement which allows the City to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the District. 
                  5.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the Local Issuing Authority may deny the permit application. 
                  6.  The City of Pine Lake shall require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the City may call the bond to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. The City Manager may release a portion of the letter of credit, for the land-disturbing amount, after final stabilization is complete and all permanent vegetation and stabilization measures are in place. If the permit holder believes they are not in violation of this article such that the surety should not be drawn against, the permit holder may appeal any notice to comply to the City of Pine Lake. Appeal shall be made by filing a written notice of appeal within five days of any notice to comply to with the City Manager stating the basis for the appeal. The City Council shall consider the appeal at the next scheduled public meeting. Except in emergency situations, the surety shall not be drawn against until the appeal is considered. The decision of the City Council shall be final. 
                  C.  Plan Requirements. 
                  1.  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in Section 22-226.B. and C. of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and State laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Commission and in consultation with the Division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
                  2.  Data Required for Site Plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  D.  Permits. 
                  1.  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the City of Pine Lake of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  2.  No permit shall be issued by the City of Pine Lake unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the District and the City Manager or his/her designee has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by Section 22-226.C. 15. and 16. are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per Section 22-227.B.6. are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Pine Lake are met.

                  6.  The City of Pine Lake may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (04-2012, § V, 11-12-2012) 
                  Sec. 22-228. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  A.  The City of Pine Lake is responsible for periodically inspecting all sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the City of Pine Lake shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  B.  The City of Pine Lake must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.

                  A.  Failure to Obtain a Permit for Land-disturbing Activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority. 
                  B.  Stop-Work Orders. 
                  1.  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the Director or the City of Pine Lake shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the Director or the City of Pine Lake shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the Director or the City of Pine Lake shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  2.  For a third and each subsequent violation, the Director or the City of Pine Lake shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
                  3.  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred.

                  1.  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the Local Issuing Authority or District for damage to any person or property. 
                  2.  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  3.  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any Waters of the State as defined thereby.

                  Sec. 26-21. - Introduction. 
                  (a)  Purchasing is the procurement of supplies, equipment and services at the lowest prices consistent with the quality needed for the effective operations of the departments of the City of Pine Lake. This procurement is an important function of the city, and for any purchasing department to be truly effective, there must be full cooperation between all departments. Serving the needs of each department will be the foremost consideration of the purchasing department. However, to obtain the greatest value for every dollar spent it is necessary to follow a set of procedures when purchases are made. 
                  (b)  The procedures outlined are to be used by all city employees in requesting and purchasing equipment and supplies. 
                  (c)  Changes will be issued as new procedures are approved.

                  (b)  Departments should assist the purchasing department by suggesting the names of vendors that have access to particular items being requested, especially items of a technical nature. However, the purchasing department is in no way confined to the vendors suggested.

                  (f)  Department heads will be called upon to assist in writing specifications for bids. Specifications should not be written which are considered "closed" (written around one specific brand). Brand names, model numbers, etc., may be submitted as a guideline as to the type and quality of merchandise desired. However, the wording "or approved equal" will always be added so as not to discriminate against any vendor's merchandise. Competition must be kept in mind throughout the writing of specifications.

                  (1)  If the separate business or commercial establishment elects to have commercial hand pick-up sanitation services, then the sanitary tax shall be a fee as listed in the schedule available for public examination in the city clerk's office. 
                  (2)  If the separate business or commercial establishment elects to utilize a trash container in lieu of commercial hand pick-up sanitation service, then the sanitary tax shall be based on the container sizes multiplied by the requested weekly pick-up fees as listed in the schedule available for public examination in the city clerk's office. 
                  (3)  Businesses or commercial establishments shall be allowed to use a common container for the price of one container fee; provided, however, that each business or commercial establishment shall be jointly and severally liable to the city for the sanitation tax imposed. 
                  (4)  If there is a joint use of a container, each user of the container shall notify the city in writing and it shall be designated in writing, and agreed upon by all users, as to whom the city shall bill for the sanitation tax imposed.

                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this chapter. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term includes any structure commonly referred to as a "mobile home" regardless of the date of manufacture. The term also includes parked trailers, travel trailers and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this chapter the term is synonymous with national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) and/or the north american vertical datum (NAVD) of 1988. 
                  National geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced after (* specific date) and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure.

                  Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the development project is located. 
                  Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the City of Pine Lake, or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above. 
                  (1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the City of Pine Lake. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the City of Pine Lake.

                  (4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an Historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this Section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (7)  In reviewing such requests, the City of Pine Lake and city's chosen civil engineer shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (8)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  (i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause;

                  (b)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a Historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (c)  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (d)  The city administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency upon request. 
                  (9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the City of Pine Lake and the city's chosen civil engineer shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.

                  ARTICLE V. - MEDIA PRODUCTIONS 

                  Sec. 38-81. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  It is the public policy of the State of Georgia to market the state as a location for media productions, recognizing the economic impact this industry provides, as well as the tourism it generates for local jurisdictions, such as the City of Pine Lake. The city is fortunate to have a diverse character and natural resources attractive to movie and television productions in the city. 
                  (b)  Despite the many positive benefits a media production may offer, certain inconveniences may result if the production company and city cannot work in concert to assure minimum standards are met and to assure a thoroughly planned production schedule is followed. These concerns are best addressed through a regulatory permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 03-2016, § 1, 12-12-2016) 
                  Sec. 38-82. - Scope of coverage. 
                  The permit required by this chapter shall be required for all movies, television or video series, pilots, feature films and documentaries, commercials, music videos, infomercials and public service announcements, whether the final product is intended for commercial use or not, unless the activity shall wholly occur on private property within an otherwise licensed facility (such as a film or television studio). Still photography shall by subject to the requirements of the permit required by this chapter when such photography results in obstruction of one or more streets, use of heavy equipment or use of public facilities in a manner that public access to those facilities is impaired. Any media production on public property, intended to be closed to participation by the public, or restricting access to public property or facilities normally accessible by the public, shall require a permit. For purposes of this chapter, media production activity shall include areas designated for parking of trucks and equipment on public or private property, base camps used during the production activity, and food service areas. No public highway, street or road shall have its public access restricted or limited except by a permit issued pursuant to this chapter. 
                  (Ord. No. 03-2016, § 1, 12-12-2016) 
                  Sec. 38-83. - Permit requirements; application and procedure. 
                  (a)  No media productions shall occur in the city without a permit therefor first having been obtained. The permit required by this chapter is allowed with conditions in all zoning districts. Whenever a permit is sought for activities in primarily residential neighborhoods, extra consideration shall be given to the conditions imposed to ameliorate as much as possible inconvenience to city residents. 
                  (b)  Two classifications of media production permits are allowed: 
                  (1)  Low-impact activities are generally those activities having an intended duration of no more than 14 consecutive days, with little or no disruption to normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby properties and uses; and 
                  (2)  High-impact activities are generally those activities having an intended duration of 15 or more consecutive days, and which otherwise do not comply with the low-impact standards of this chapter, and/or activities of any duration that will likely disrupt normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby properties and uses. Any filming involving automobile crashes or chases, gunfire, pyrotechnics, explosives, the use of aircraft, stunts, and similar activities are examples of high-impact activities. 
                  (c)  All applications shall be made in writing on forms provided by the city. Applications shall be submitted in duplicate originals. No application shall be deemed accepted unless accompanied by payment of the requisite application fee in US funds. 
                  (d)  Every application shall state the name and contact information of a responsible representative of the applicant, who shall be available at all times during actual production activity within the city and for a period of not less than one year thereafter. More than one point of contact may be specified. 
                  (e)  The application shall contain a detailed narrative of the scope of production activities, and include drawings, maps or plats to illustrate locations, property boundaries, existing material improvements, planned temporary improvements, curb cuts and driveways, adjoining streets, traffic patterns, and similar information helpful to assess the impact of the proposed activity. 
                  (f)  When activity is to occur in or near residential areas, personal notice of intent to secure a permit and the place, date and time of the proposed media activity shall be provided by the applicant, within five days of filing the application. To the extent feasible, written acknowledgment of the notice shall be obtained from the resident or resident's agent. For purposes of the section, all residential properties within 500 feet of the outside boundaries of the location where production activity is to occur shall be notified. 
                  (g)  A signed indemnification and hold harmless agreement, in a form acceptable to the city attorney, shall accompany the application, together with a certificate of insurance naming the city as an additional insured. The minimum limits of insurance coverage shall not be less than $1 million per occurrence. 
                  (h)  All applications shall be filed with the city administrator, or her designee, who may require such additional information as needed to assess the proposed extent and intensity of the production within the city. 
                  (i)  All applications shall be approved with specific terms and conditions, or denied, by the city administrator, or her designee, in writing. If approved, the city shall issue a permit to the applicant, in writing, with all terms and conditions clearly set forth therein. Low-impact activity applications shall be approved or denied within 10 business days of a complete application, and high-impact activity applications shall be approved or denied within 20 business days of a complete application. If the application is denied, the city Administrator, or her designee, shall state, in writing, the reasons for denial. An aggrieved applicant may appeal to the Mayor and city council at the next regular meeting occurring more than five (5) days following receipt of a written denial. 
                  (j)  Permits may be denied, in whole or in part, due to prior scheduled events or activities sanctioned or permitted by the city under other provisions of this code. In addition to denial of permits not meeting standards of this chapter, the city reserves the right to deny any permit that it deems detrimental to the peace or security of residents of the city. 
                  (k)  Any material variation from the approved scope of work permitted shall be grounds for permit revocation, unless the permit is modified in advance by the permittee.

                  (1)  Prior to making application for a permit, the applicant shall meet with the mayor, city administrator and chief of police, or their designees, to review locations and the general scope of activities planned during the production.

                  (2)  No tents, temporary sanitary facilities, trash collection or food service facilities shall be located within 100 feet of the property line of any property used for residential use, unless the owner or tenant in charge of such property gives written consent. 
                  (3)  Tents, depending on their square footage, and other temporary structures may require a separate building permit from the city; any food preparation or food service provided at the location shall require a food service permit from the county health department, or evidence of exemption. 
                  (4)  Lighting for filming shall be oriented away from adjacent or nearby properties to the extent possible and shall not interfere with the safe movement of vehicular traffic. 
                  (5)  Temporary signage shall be approved by the city administrator, or her designee, in writing, in advance, prior to erection; approval of temporary signage is conditioned upon restoration of permanent signage following completion of media activity. 
                  (6)  No regulatory traffic control signage within a public right-of-way shall be removed without the prior written consent of the chief of police. 
                  (7)  No modification to any existing traffic signage, streetlight, traffic control device or other officially installed facility or improvement shall be made without prior consent of the chief of police. 
                  (8)  No street, road, alley, or sidewalk shall be closed, barricaded or other obstruction erected within a public right-of-way, and no access shall be denied or restricted to public or private property or facilities unless the closure or restriction is approved as a condition of the permit; reasonable alternative access shall be arranged whenever possible. 
                  (9)  No trees, vegetation (including grasses), or ornamental shrubs shall be cut or removed from public property without prior written consent of the city in the permit, based upon an agreed landscape restoration plan. A land disturbance permit may be separately required, depending upon the nature and extent of the activity. 
                  (10)  The applicant shall submit to the chief of police a traffic management plan to address traffic flow in the vicinity of the location where production activity is to occur, even if normal traffic flow is not to be obstructed or interrupted. Detours shall be determined and approved by the chief of police. Temporary traffic control devices and signage as required by the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices shall be provided at the sole expense of the applicant. The city fire marshal shall also review and approve such plan. 
                  (11)  The City of Pine Lake shall be listed in the production credits for all permits issued. 
                  (12)  The city will not intervene on behalf of any permittee or negotiate access rights to private property with property owners; the permittee is expected to deal directly with private property owners for required permission and consent.

                  In addition to the general standards, the following minimal standards shall be met in order to be permitted as a low-impact activity. Due to the varying requirements of media productions and the nature of the industry, the standards are not intended to be all inclusive, and additional conditions may be reasonably imposed, as warranted, to minimize anticipated adverse effects. 
                  (1)  No permit shall be effective for more than 14 consecutive days from its date of issuance. Permits may be extended by the city administrator, for reasonable cause, provided a daily filming fee shall apply.

In the application of stormwater service charge rates, multiple dwelling unit properties shall be treated as other developed lands. 
                  Other developed land means, but shall not be limited to, multiple dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, houses of worship, public and private schools and universities, government buildings, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers and mixed use developments. 
                  Service charges means the stormwater management service charge applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the city stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. 
                  (1)  Service charges will be based on measurable parameters which influence the stormwater utility's cost of services and facilities, and may include but are not necessarily limited to the amount of impervious area on each parcel of developed land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or of grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. 
                  (2)  Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to individual customers for services or facilities related to stormwater management, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection or development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced levels of stormwater services above those normally provided by the city.

                  Sec. 46-2. - Determination and modification of stormwater service charges. 
                  Stormwater service charges may be determined and modified from time to time by the city council so that the total revenue generated by said charges and any other sources of revenue that may be made available to the stormwater utility will be sufficient to meet the cost of services and facilities, including but not limited to the payment of principal and interest on revenue bond obligations incurred for consideration and improvements to the stormwater system. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-1-3; Ord. No. 12-2005, § 5-1-3, 5-9-2005)

                  Stormwater service charges shall accrue and shall be billed periodically to customers, except as specific exemptions and credits may apply. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-1-4; Ord. No. 12-2005, § 5-1-4, 5-9-2005) 
                  Sec. 46-4. - Stormwater service charges. 
                  In order to recover the cost of providing stormwater services and facilities while fairly and reasonably apportioning the cost among developed properties throughout the city, the following stormwater rates shall apply: 
                  (1)  Detached dwelling units. Detached dwellings units shall be charged the rate applicable to one equivalent residential unit as specified below, or as amended by ordinance in the future. 
                  (2)  Other developed lands. All developed lands not classified as detached dwelling units shall be billed for one equivalent residential unit (ERU) for each 1,500 square feet of impervious surface or increment thereof. 
                  (3)  Stormwater service charge. The stormwater service charge per equivalent residential unit (ERU) shall be on a schedule that will be available for review in the clerk's office. 
                  (4)  Land devleoped after September, 2010, within the city's stream buffer will be charged an additional fee proportional to the impervious surface within that buffer. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-1-5; Ord. No. 12-2005, § 5-1-5, 5-9-2005; Ord. No. 2010-004, 8-9-2010) 
                  Sec. 46-5. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service charges. 
                  (a)  Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater utility service charges or receive a credit or offset against such service charges. No exception, credit, offset or other reduction in stormwater service charges shall be granted based on the age, tax or economic status, race or religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. 
                  (b)  A "Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual" shall be prepared by the department of public works specifying the design and performance standards of on-site systems, facilities, activities and services which qualify for application of a service charge credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. 
                  (c)  Undeveloped land as defined in this chapter shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
                  (d)  Railroad tracks shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
                  (e)  Developed land other than individual detached dwelling units, including but not limited to multiple dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs, and water and wastewater treatment plants may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the "Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual." The stormwater service charge credit may be up to 50 percent of the service charge applicable to a property, and shall be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. 
                  (f)  Groups of detached dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association providing on-site systems, facilities, services or activities which reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the "Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual." The stormwater service charge credit available to groups of detached dwellings units may be up to 50 percent of the service charge applicable to the individual properties, and shall be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the homeowners association reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. 
                  (g)  Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the "Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual" and/or upon continuing provision of the systems, facilities, services and activities provided, operated and maintained by the property owner upon which the credit is based. A credit may be revoked by the city at any time for noncompliance. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-1-6; Ord. No. 12-2005, § 5-1-6, 5-9-2005) 
                  Sec. 46-6. - Stormwater service charge billing, delinquencies, collections, etc.. 
                  A stormwater service charge will be added to the annual county ad valorem real estate tax billing and sent through the United States mail or by alternative means notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Initially, unpaid fees will be pursued from the person who incurred the fees; the owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is under billed or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency. A late charge shall be billed based on the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility service charge that becomes delinquent. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-1-7; Ord. No. 12-2005, § 5-1-7, 5-9-2005)

                  (1)  An appeal must be filed in writing with the office of the city director of administration. In the case of service charge appeals, the appeal shall include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer containing information on the total property area, the impervious surface area, and any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events. Using the information provided by the appellant, the director of administration shall conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond to the appeal in writing within 30 days. 
                  (2)  In response to an appeal the director of administration may adjust the stormwater service charge applicable to a property in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this chapter. 
                  (3)  A decision of the director of administration which is adverse to an appellant may be further appealed to the city council within 30 days of the adverse decision. Notice of the appeal shall be delivered to the city clerk by the appellant, stating the grounds for the further appeal. The city clerk shall issue a written decision on the appeal within 30 days. All decisions of the city council shall be served on the customer personally or by registered or certified mail, sent to the billing address of the customer. 
                  (4)  All decisions by the city council shall be final. 
                  (5)  The appeal process contained in this section shall be a condition precedent to an aggrieved customer seeking judicial relief. Any decision of the director of administration may be reviewed upon application for writ of certiorari before the superior court of the county, filed within 30 days of the date of service of the decision.

                  (a)  No person shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve or convert any sign or structure in the city, or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a separate permit for such a sign or structure from the director of administration or his or her representative. Each application must be accompanied by: 
                  (1)  A fee as established from time to time by resolution of the mayor and council; 
                  (2)  A sketch or drawing of the proposed sign showing size, dimensions, character height and other information as required by the city to establish compliance with this chapter;

                  (d)  Conditions of the permit. The director of administration or his or her representative shall act upon an application for a permit with plans as filed, or as amended, without unreasonable or unnecessary delay, but no action can be taken until the application requirements have been met. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of this Code, nor shall such issuance of a permit prevent the director of administration or his or her representative, from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans or in construction, or of violations of this Code. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after the time the permit is issued; provided that, for cause, one or more extensions of time, for periods not exceeding 90 days each, may be allowed, and such extensions shall be in writing by the director of administration or his or her representative.

This ordinance is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the City of Pine Lake telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the sitting of telecommunications facilities within the City of Pine Lake so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the City of Pine Lake as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this ordinance shall: 
                  A.  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the City of Pine Lake;

                  C.  Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, sitting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
                  D.  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful sitting of telecommunications tower structures and antennae; 
                  E.  Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; 
                  F.  Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and

                  C.  In office and institutional (O-I) and agricultural (A-1) zoning districts, micro and macro telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use by right following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the director. Monopole towers up to a height of 50 feet are permitted as a special use following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the director. 
                  D.  In single-family residential (R-1) and planned unit development (PUD) zoning districts, macro and micro telecommunications facilities shall not be allowed. No macro or micro telecommunications facilities shall be allowed with[in] 200 feet or twice the height of the tower, whichever is the greatest, of any residential property line, except by variance hearing. 
                  E.  Telecommunications facilities outside the guidelines listed above may only be built after approval of a variance in accordance with Title 6-3-22 of the Code of the City of Pine Lake [Zoning Appendix] as well as receipt of a building permit. 
                  V.  Preferred and disfavored location sites. 
                  A.  Preferred location sites. 
                  1.  Co-location [collocation] sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this ordinance and co-location [collocation] sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the director or the governing authority to be visually obtrusive. 
                  2.  Publicly-used structures. Publicly-used structures are preferred locations because their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly-used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly-used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches. 
                  3.  Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility. 
                  4.  Mixed use buildings in high density districts. Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other non-residential space) are also preferred location sites. 
                  B.  Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential structure or site or multi-family duplex shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities. No macro or micro telecommunication facilities shall be located within 200 feet or twice the height of the tower, whichever is the greatest, of any residential property line or multi-family duplex except by variance hearing. 
                  VI.  Requirements for telecommunications facilities. 
                  A.  General requirements for all telecommunications facilities. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance. 
                  1.  Building codes and safety standards: To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the director. 
                  2.  Regulatory compliance. 
                  a.  All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 
                  b.  Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  3.  Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. 
                  4.  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  5.  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this ordinance are met. 
                  6.  Visual impact. 
                  a.  Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background. 
                  c.  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. 
                  d.  Reserved. 
                  e.  Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  f.  Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
                  7.  Landscaping. 
                  a.  Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property. 
                  b.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  c.  The director may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the director. 
                  8.  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street. 
                  9.  Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
                  a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility. 
                  b.  Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 
                  10.  Lot size and setbacks. 
                  a.  The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities provided, however, that the director may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby. 
                  i.  Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to 200 feet or twice the height of the tower, whichever is greater, from any off-site residential property line. 
                  ii.  Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
                  iii.  Telecommunications facilities must be setback from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section VII. 
                  b.  For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten foot high antenna and supporting structure requires ten foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact. 
                  B.  Additional requirements for towers. 
                  1.  Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. 
                  2.  Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 
                  3.  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  4.  Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable. 
                  5.  When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line 200 feet or twice the height of the tower whichever is greatest. 
                  6.  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district. 
                  7.  Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter. 
                  8.  Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access. 
                  9.  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
                  VII.  Application procedures. 
                  A.  General application requirements for all building and special use permits. Application for a building permit or special use permit for any telecommunications facility shall be made to the director by the person, company or organization that will own and operate the telecommunications facility.

                  3.  Additional information requirements for towers. 
                  a.  If the proposed site is zoned R-1 through R-3, PUD, O-I or A-1, and there are alternative sites in M-1, M-2, C-2, C-3, C-4 or OBP, applicants must justify why those alternate sites have not been proposed. The director will review with special care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The director shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site. 
                  b.  Applicants must identify all existing towers and all towers for which there are applications currently on file with the director. Applicants must provide evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna. If co-location [collocation] on any such towers would result in less visual impact than the visual impact of the proposed tower, applicants must justify why such collocation is not being proposed. If co-location [collocation] on any such tower would increase negative visual impact, then the applicant must so state and demonstrate. The director will review with special care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The director shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site. 
                  c.  In all zones, applicants must demonstrate that they cannot provide personal wireless communication service without the use of a telecommunications tower. 
                  d.  The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number and types of antennae. The applicant shall provide a drawing for each tower showing existing and proposed antennae locations. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The director shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means. 
                  e.  The applicant must provide a utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power lines impacting the proposed tower site. 
                  4.  The applicant must provide any other information which may be requested by the director to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed telecommunications facility. 
                  B.  Expedited review for building permits only. When a telecommunications facility will be a use as of right pursuant to section IV of this ordinance and requires only a building permit and design review before it may be erected, the director will expedite review of the application and render a decision on the application within 30 business days after receipt of a complete application. 
                  C.  Special use permits. 
                  1.  A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the director and handled in accordance with the special use permit provision of Title 6 of the Municipal Code. The director or his/her designee may issue a special use permit under this section provided it shall have determined that all of the requirements of section VI have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties. 
                  2.  In granting a special use permit, the director or his/her designee may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties. 
                  VIII.  Co-location. [Collocation] Applicant and owner shall allow other future personal wireless service companies, including public and quasi-public agencies, using functionally equivalent personal wireless technology to co-locate [collocate] antennae, equipment and facilities on a telecommunications facility unless specific technical constraints prohibit said co-location [collocation]. Applicant and other personal wireless carriers shall provide a mechanism for the construction and maintenance of shared facilities and infrastructure and shall provide for equitable sharing of cost in accordance with industry standards. 
                  IX.  Appeals. Appeals from any decision of the director may be taken by any person aggrieved or any official of the city affected by the decision of the director. Such appeal shall be to the [planning and zoning commission/zoning appeals board] pursuant to Title 6-3 [Zoning Appendix] of the Municipal Code. Appeals from any decision of the [planning and zoning commission/zoning appeals board] may be taken by any person aggrieved or any official of the city affected by the decision of the [planning and zoning commission/zoning appeals board] and shall be to the governing body in accordance with Title 6-3 of the Municipal Code. Appeals from any decision of the governing body shall be made to the superior court within 30 days of the decision. Any decision by the director or by the [planning and zoning commission/zoning appeals board] denying a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications facility shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence in a written record. Any decision by the governing body denying or approving a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications facility shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence in a written record. 
                  X.  Nuisances. Telecommunications facilities, including, without limitation, power source, ventilation and cooling, shall be operated at all times within the limits of the City of Pine Lake Noise Ordinance, shall not be operated so as to cause the generation of heat that adversely affects a building occupant and shall not be maintained or operated in such a manner as to be a nuisance. 
                  XI.  Removal of antennae and towers. All telecommunications facilities shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such facilities. If upon inspection by the director any such telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owners shall have 30 days to bring such facility into compliance. In the event such telecommunications facility is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring the telecommunications facility to be removed. In the event such telecommunications facility is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the city may remove such facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  XII.  Abandoned towers. 
                  A.  Any telecommunications facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of it or any part of it. The owner of a telecommunications facility and the owner of the property where the facility is located shall be under a duty to remove the abandoned telecommunications facility. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  B.  If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this ordinance as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna. 
                  XIII.  Pre-existing towers/non-conforming uses. 
                  A.  All telecommunications facilities operative on May 10, 2004, shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a non-conforming use and shall be treated as a non-conforming use in accordance with section 6-3 [Zoning Appendix] of the Municipal Code. Routine maintenance, including replacement with a new tower or antenna of like construction and height, shall be permitted on such existing telecommunications facilities. New construction other than routine maintenance shall comply with the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  B.  A telecommunications facility that has received city approval as of May 10 in the form of either a building permit or special use exception, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation shall be considered an existing telecommunications facility so long as such approval is current and not expired. 
                  C.  Placement of an antenna on a nonconforming structure shall not be considered an expansion of the nonconforming structure. 
                  XIV.  Penalty for violation of ordinance. 
                  A.  Any person who attempts to erect or erects a telecommunications facility covered by this ordinance without having first obtained the necessary building permit, special use permit or variance in the manner provided in this ordinance shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance. Any responsible party or other persons convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction of violating any provision of this ordinance shall be guilty of violating a duly adopted ordinance of the city and shall be punished either by a fine not to exceed $25,000.00 or by imprisonment not to exceed six months or both. The court shall have the power and authority to place any person guilty of violation of this ordinance on probation and to suspend or modify any fine or sentence. As a condition of such suspension, the court may require payment of restitution or impose other punishment allowed by law. 
                  B.  If any structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained in violation of this ordinance or without obtaining that required permits, or if any building, structure or land is used in violation of this article, the city attorney, in addition to any other remedies, may institute proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use or to correct or abate such violations. Each and every day such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use continues may be deemed a separate offense. 
                  XV.  Coordination with federal law. Whenever the governing authority finds that the application of this ordinance would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services or prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, a conditional use permit waiving any or all of the provisions of this ordinance may be granted.

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Printed herein are the "Mixed Use Development" code provisions of the city, as codified by the City Council in the 1986 city code at Title 6, "Planning and Development," Chapter 3, "Zoning," Section 28. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. The style used for headings and catchlines has been made uniform and consistent with those appearing in the Code. The same system of capitalization and expression of numbers in text has been used as it appears in the Code of Ordinances. Additions made for clarity, such as consistent state statute citations and catchline modifications, are indicated by brackets. 

                  Sec. 6-3-28. - Mixed use development. 
                  Mixed-use development is one of the cornerstones of quality growth. Quality growth seeks to minimize automobile use, improve community design, use public infrastructure wisely, and conserve environmental resources. It allows an area to be useful for a much more significant part of the 24-hour day than single-use developments. Additionally, mixed-use developments can also make more efficient use of land and public infrastructure. The right mix of uses can be extremely efficient in using resources such as roadways, parking, and even water and sewer. 
                  Section 1. - Purpose and application. 
                  This ordinance is meant to apply to those areas within the Pine Lake commercial and professional district that have been zoned mixed use. 
                  The purpose of mixed use is to improve Pine Lake commercial and professional environments in the following ways: 
                  1)  Encourage, protect and enhance the pedestrian environment. 
                  2)  Improve the aesthetics of the commercial/professional districts. 
                  3)  Provide for parking in a way that does not diminish the pedestrian environment. 
                  4)  Encourage additional street level activity. 
                  5)  Promote opportunities for residential and commercial development.

                  a)  The proposal is a "mixed-use" development or contributes to a mixed-use district; 
                  b)  The proposal is designed in such a way that it is well integrated with adjacent land uses. "Integrated" means that uses are within a comfortable walking distance (one-eighth mile) and are connected to each other with direct, convenient and attractive sidewalks and/or pathways; or 
                  c)  The existing and planned land uses on, or in the vicinity of, the site make it impracticable to meet guideline a) or b); or 
                  d)  The proposal contains an equally good or superior way to achieve the above criterion. 
                  3)  Pedestrian access, safety and comfort. All portions of the development are accessible by a direct, convenient, attractive, safe and comfortable system of pedestrian facilities, and the development provides appropriate pedestrian amenities. The design of buildings supports a safe and attractive pedestrian environment. 
                  a)  In the mixed use, commercial, or professional building zones, each building, residence, or commercial space shall have at least one primary entrance facing a street, or directly accessed by a sidewalk or plaza within ten feet of the primary entrance; and 
                  b)  Building entrances in mixed use, commercial, or professional building zones open directly to the outside; every building has at least one entrance that does not require passage through a parking lot or garage to gain access; corner buildings have corner entrances whenever possible; and 
                  c)  In the mixed use, commercial, or professional building zones windows or window displays are provided along at least 30—60 percent of the portion of the building's facade that is designated commercial or professional; and 
                  d)  Pedestrian facilities as defined in section 4(d), below, shall connect the development to adjacent land uses and provide connections through the development to the public street right-of-way; 
                  e)  Parking and vehicle drives shall be located away from building entrances, and not between a building entrance and sidewalks, or plazas; 
                  f)  Surface parking is oriented behind or to the side of a building when possible; parking shall be accessed from an alley only when it attaches to a commercial street; and parking shall not be located on street corners;

                  b)  Public streets are preferred over private streets to accommodate through traffic; and 
                  c)  The proposal implements all planned street connections, as designated by the regional transportation plan, the DeKalb County comprehensive transportation plan, and the City of Pine Lake comprehensive plan; and 
                  d)  When street connection(s) is/are not practicable, pedestrian connection(s), are made to and through the development in lieu of planned street connection(s). Pedestrian connections should equal what would be available if they were on a street (i.e., distinct from vehicle lane, minimum clear space, Americans With Disabilities Act accessible, direct rate with minimum interruption, shade by day and light by night, connects to a destination that attracts pedestrian activity (front door of commercial use, public plaza/park, residence, transit stop, true street, etc.); and/or 
                  e)  The proposal contains an equally good or superior way to achieve the above criterion. 
                  5)  Crime prevention and security. The site design, buildings, signs, landscaping, parking and other elements provide a safe environment for customers, employees, occupants and adjacent properties. Crime prevention shall be considered in the site design through application of all of the following guidelines: 
                  a)  Territoriality . All proposed building entrances, parking areas, pathways and other elements are defined with appropriate features that express ownership (generally, people protect and maintain territory that they feel is their own and have a certain respect for the territory of others). For example, landscaping, fences, pavement treatments, art and signs are some physical ways to express ownership through design. Such features should not conflict with the need for natural surveillance, as described in b); and 
                  b)  Natural surveillance . The proposed site layout, building and landscape design promote natural surveillance. Physical features and activities should be oriented and designed in ways that maximize the ability to see throughout the site. For example, window placement, the use of front porches or stoops, use of low or see-through walls, and appropriate use of landscaping and lighting can promote natural surveillance. Sight-obscuring shrubs and walls should be avoided (shrubs and walls should not exceed three feet in height, and the lowest hanging branches of trees should not be lower than five feet, exceptions shall be granted for new saplings that have not reached their mature heights), except as necessary for buffering between commercial uses and lower density residential districts, and then shall be minimized; and 
                  c)  Activity support. The proposed site layout and building design encourage legitimate activity in public spaces. For example, locating outdoor seating in areas that are visible from inside a restaurant helps to discourage crime and supports the activity of dining; and 
                  d)  Access control. By properly sitting and designing entrances and exits (i.e., in clear view from the store), and through the appropriate use of lighting, signs and/or other features, the proposed plan controls access in ways that discourage crime; and/or 
                  e)  [ Other means of compliance. ] The proposal contains an equally good or superior way to achieve the above criterion and guideline(s). 
                  6)  Parking and land use efficiency . All of the following methods are used whenever possible to minimize the amount of land developed as surface parking: 
                  a)  Shared parking. "Shared parking" means that multiple uses share one or more parking facilities. Parking demands must "peak" during different times of the day. 
                  i)  The minimum number of parking spaces for a mixed use development or where shared parking strategies are proposed shall be determined by a study prepared by the applicant following the procedures of the urban land institute shared parking report, ITE shared parking guidelines, or other approved procedures. A formal parking study may be waived for small developments where there is established experience with the land use mix and its impact is expected to be minimal. The actual number of parking spaces required shall be based on well-recognized sources of parking data such as the ULI or ITE reports. If standard rates are not available or limited, the applicant may collect data at similar sites to establish local parking demand rates. If the shared parking plan assumes use of an existing parking facility, then field surveys shall be conducted to determine actual parking accumulation. If possible, these surveys should consider the seasonal peak period for the combination of land uses involved. 
                  ii)  If a privately owned parking facility is to serve two or more separate properties, a legal agreement between owners guaranteeing access to, use of, and management of designated spaces is required. For a sample shared parking ordinance, please refer to appendix A: model - shared use agreement for parking facilities. 
                  b)  Credit for on-street parking. The amount of required off-street parking shall be reduced by one off-street parking space for every on-street parking space adjacent to the development. On-street parking shall follow the established configuration of existing on-street parking, subject to city standards, except that angled parking may be allowed for some streets, as approved by the development authority. The configuration of the on-street parking and allowable credit toward off-street parking requirements shall be addressed during site/design review. The city clerk shall maintain a written record of credits granted per each use; 
                  c)  Reduce or waive minimum off-street parking standards. The applicant may request a reduction to or waiver of parking standards based on a parking impact study. The study allows the applicant to propose a reduced parking standard based on estimated peak use, reductions due to easy pedestrian accessibility; availability of transit service, and likelihood of car pool use; and adjacent on-street parking. The parking study is subject to review and approval or modification by the development authority; 
                  d)  Maximum parking ratio. Surface parking shall not exceed 110 percent of the minimum parking requirement for the subject land use(s). Exemptions to the standard can be approved through site/design review for developments that provide parking structures, shared parking, valet parking spaces, market rate parking, or similarly managed parking facilities; 
                  e)  Structured parking incentive. A density or floor area bonus of one building story may be granted for every full story of structured parking provided below grade in a building. A maximum credit of two stories may be applied, and may not be used to exceed the height restrictions along a public street [section 5, 2) a)], but may be applied to allow an exception to height restrictions set back from the public road frontage, subject to the residential setback height requirements in section 5, 2) c). 
                  f)  Valet parking . Valet parking is permitted where a valet parking plan is approved by the city with the site/design review application. Valet parking allows stacking of smaller parking spaces with less space devoted to drive aisles. 
                  7)  Creating and protecting public spaces. The proposal provides usable public space, and recognizes and responds appropriately to existing or planned public spaces (e.g., parks, civic buildings and spaces, transit stops, sidewalks, plazas, and similar spaces). Public spaces are "public" when they are within view of a street or other public space, accessible by pedestrians, and can be occupied by people. All developments shall meet or exceed the following guidelines. A development proposal may be required to mitigate impacts to a public space when it is likely to degrade public safety, or the function, comfort or attractiveness of a public space. 
                  a)  The development provides at least 20 square feet of public space, in addition to required sidewalk(s), for every ten off-street surface parking spaces or 1,000 square feet of ground-floor space, whichever is greater. 
                  b)  The development does not diminish the safety, function, comfort or attraction of an existing public space, as described in 1—4, below. A superior design may enhance an existing public space and/or create a superior public space(s). 
                  1)  "Safety" means both pedestrian safety near vehicles, and safety related to crime prevention (see number 5, above); and 
                  2)  The "function" of a public space may include transportation, in the case of the sidewalk; recreation and socialization, in the case of a plaza or park; and 
                  3)  "Comfort" means the ability of a public space to reasonably accommodate expected uses; and 
                  4)  "Attraction" relates to the reason people use the public space; and/or 
                  c)  The proposal contains an equally good or superior way to achieve the above criterion. 
                  8)  Human scaled building design . Building facades are designed to a human-scale, for aesthetic appeal, pedestrian comfort, and compatibility with the design character of the district or neighborhood. Building design standards should be tailored to fit the local design context and character. Proposed development should consider the following guidelines: 
                  a)  Existing architectural character of the neighborhood/district, which may or may not be an appropriate guide for new development or redevelopment; design reflects the context of its surroundings or create its own distinct look and identity; 
                  b)  Continuity of the building sizes; 
                  c)  How the street-level and upper-level architectural detailing is treated; 
                  d)  Roof forms; 
                  e)  Rhythm of windows and doors; and 
                  f)  General relationship of buildings to public spaces such as streets, plazas, other open space and public parking.
