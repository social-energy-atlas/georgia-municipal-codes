PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                       This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Acworth, Georgia. 
                      Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code, as supplemented through November 3, 1988, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and board of aldermen. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                      The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                      The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                      The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

                  CDi:1 

                  Indexes 
                      The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                      A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                      Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                      This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron McLaughlin, Code Attorney, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                      The publisher is most grateful to Christina V. Lynch, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  ORDINANCE NO. 2002-02 
                  AN ORDINANCE 
                  ADOPTING AND ENACTING a new Code for Acworth, Georgia; establishing the same; providing for the repeal of certain ordinances not included therein, except as herein expressly provided; providing for the manner of amending such code; providing when this ordinance shall become effective; providing certain penalties; and for other purposes. 
                  NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT HEREBY ORDAINED BY THE MAYOR AND BOARD OF ALDERMEN OF THE CITY OF ACWORTH, GEORGIA THAT: the document entitled the "Code of Acworth, Georgia" is hereby amended as follows: 
                      Section 1: The document entitled the "Code of Acworth, Georgia," a copy whereof accompanies this ordinance and is incorporated herein and made a part hereof, is hereby adopted and shall be treated and considered as a new and original comprehensive ordinance. 
                      Section 2: All ordinances and resolutions of a general and permanent nature of Acworth, Georgia, enacted on final passage on or before January 17, 2002, and not in the code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein are hereby repealed from and after the effective date of this ordinance, except as hereinafter provided. 
                      Section 3: The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not affect any offense or act committed or done or any penalty or forfeiture incurred or any contract or right established or accruing before the effective date of this ordinance; nor shall this repeal affect any ordinance or resolution of the city promising or guaranteeing the payment of money by or to the city, or authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the city, or any evidence of the city's indebtedness, or any contract or obligation assumed by the city; nor shall this repeal affect any rights or franchise granted by any ordinance or resolution of the city to any person, firm or corporation; nor shall this repeal affect any ordinance or resolution dedicating, naming, establishing, locating, relocating, opening, paving, widening, vacating, etc., any street or public way in the city; nor shall this repeal affect the present annual appropriation of the city, nor shall this repeal affect any ordinance or resolution levying or imposing charges, fees, or taxes now due or accrued; nor shall this repeal be construed to revive any ordinance or resolution or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance or resolution which is repealed by this ordinance. 
                      Section 4. The provisions appearing in the code, so far as they are the same as provisions of ordinances and resolutions existing at the time of the effective date of this code are intended and shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments. 
                      Section 5. Any and all additions or amendments to the code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the board of aldermen to make the same a part thereof, shall be deemed to be incorporated into the code so that reference to the "Code of Acworth, Georgia," shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments. 
                      Section 6. A copy of the code shall be kept on file in the office of the city clerk, and preserved in loose-leaf form, or in such other form as the city clerk may consider most expedient. It shall be the express duty of the city clerk or someone authorized by the city clerk, to insert in their designated places all amendments, ordinances or resolutions which indicate the intention of the Board of Aldermen to make those provisions a part of the code, when those provisions have been reprinted in page form, and to extract from the code all provisions which may be from time to time repealed by the board of aldermen. A copy of the code shall be available for all persons desiring to examine it and shall be considered the official Code of Acworth, Georgia. 
                      Section 7. As pages of the code are replaced because the matter contained on them shall have been repealed, amended, or otherwise shall have been superseded or rendered obsolete or inoperative, the city clerk shall retain copies of the pages of the code so superseded, rendered obsolete or otherwise rendered inoperative in a file so that the former provisions of the code may be readily available and easily found. The purpose of this section is to permit anyone desiring to do so to ascertain the precise status of any sections of the code as of any given date. 
                      Section 8. In case of the amendment of any section of the code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in the city charter of the code shall apply to the section as amended; or in case such amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so provided in such section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, unless such penalty is specifically repealed herein. 
                      Section 9. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of the code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with the code in any manner whatsoever which may cause the law of Acworth, Georgia to be misrepresented thereby. 
                      Section 10. It is hereby declared to be the intention of this ordinance that its sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases are severable, and if any section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance is declared unconstitutional or invalid, it shall not affect any of the remaining sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this ordinance. 
                      Section 11: All ordinances or part of ordinances in conflict with this ordinance are hereby repealed. 
                      Section 12: This ordinance shall become effective on January 17, 2002.

                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                      The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances and resolutions have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances and resolutions that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code and are considered "Includes." Ordinances and resolutions that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code and are considered "Omits." 
                      In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                      There is hereby created a body corporate and politic, to be known as the Acworth Lake Authority, which shall be deemed to be a political subdivision of the State of Georgia and a public corporation and by that name, style and title said body may contract and be contracted with, sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded, complain and defend in all courts of law and equity. The authority shall consist of five (5) members, one of whom shall be the mayor of the City of Acworth in Cobb County, and four (4) members who shall be selected by the mayor and council of that city being the governing body of the said City of Acworth. The term of office on the said authority of the mayor of the City of Acworth shall be for the same term that he is acting as mayor of the said city, and he shall be the chairman of the Acworth Lake Authority. In addition to the chairman provided for above, the authority shall select one of its members as secretary-treasurer. The initial four (4) members of the Acworth Lake Authority, other than the mayor of the City of Acworth, shall be elected at the first meeting of the mayor and council of the said City of Acworth in the month of May, 1964. One member elected at that time shall serve for one year and until the election and qualification of his successor at the first meeting of the mayor and council of the City of Acworth in the month of May, 1965; another member elected in May, 1964 shall serve for two (2) years and until the election and qualification of his successor at the first meeting of the mayor and council of the City of Acworth in the month of May, 1966; another member elected in May, 1964 shall serve for three (3) years and until the election and qualification of his successor at the first meeting of the mayor and council of the City of Acworth in the month of May, 1967; and another member elected in May, 1964 shall serve for four (4) years and until the election and qualification of his successor at the first meeting of the mayor and council of the City of Acworth in the month of May, 1968. Thereafter, the term of each member of the said authority, other than the mayor of the City of Acworth, shall be for a term of four (4) years and until their successors are elected and qualified, so that staggered terms for members, other than the mayor of the City of Acworth, shall exist. Three (3) members of the authority shall constitute a quorum. Each member of the authority shall have one vote, including the chairman, on any issue or matter. A majority of the quorum are empowered to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the authority and no vacancy on the authority shall impair the right of the quorum to act. In the event of a vacancy on the authority through death, resignation or otherwise, same shall be filled for the unexpired term of the member ceasing to be a member of such authority for any reason, in the same manner that such member originally became a member of the authority, that is, by succession in office, or by appointment as aforesaid. The membership of the authority shall serve without compensation except that they shall be reimbursed for the actual expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of their duties. The authority shall make rules and regulations for its own government. It shall have perpetual existence.

A majority of members shall constitute a quorum and a majority may act for the authority in any matter. No vacancy shall impair the power of the authority to act. No member of the authority shall be the mayor nor a member of the council [sic] of the City of Acworth, but there shall be no other disqualification to hold public office by reason of membership in the authority. 
                  (c)  The property, obligations, and the interest on the obligations of the authority shall have the same immunity from taxation as the property, obligations, and interest on the obligations of the City of Acworth.

                  (10)  To extend credit or make loans to any person, corporation, partnership (limited or general), or other entity for the costs of any project or any part of the costs of any project, which credit or loans shall be evidenced or secured by loan agreements, notes, mortgages, deeds to secure debt, trust deeds, security agreements, assignments, and such other instruments or by rentals, revenues, fees, or charges, upon such terms and conditions as the authority shall determine to be reasonable in connection with such extension of credit or loans, including provision for the establishment and maintenance of reserves and insurance funds, and, in the exercise of powers granted by this paragraph in connection with any project, the authority shall have the right and power to require the inclusion in any such loan agreement, note, mortgage, deed to secure debt, trust deed, security agreement, assignment, or other instrument of such provisions for guaranty, insurance, construction, use, operation, maintenance, and financing of a project, and such other terms and conditions as the authority may deem necessary or desirable.

                  (12)  To exercise any power granted by the laws of the State of Georgia to public or private corporations which is not in conflict with the constitution and laws of the State of Georgia. 
                  (13)  To do all things necessary or convenient to carry out the powers expressly conferred by this paragraph. 
                  (e)  The authority shall be authorized to levy upon all real property subject to taxation by the authority within the downtown development district on January 1 of each year, a tax not to exceed 25 mills upon the assessed value of all such property, according to the assessed value of such property for ad valorem tax purposes for the City of Acworth. All taxes levied by the authority shall become due and payable at the same time as ad valorem taxes levied by the City of Acworth. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as City of Acworth ad valorem taxes. 
                  (f)  The authority shall have the right and power of eminent domain over the downtown development district for the purpose of acquiring property in carrying out its aims and objectives. 
                  (g)  The downtown development district shall be determined by resolution of the mayor and council [sic] of the City of Acworth and may be amended or changed from time to time at the discretion of the mayor and council [sic]. 
                  (h)  The revenue bonds or obligations herein authorized to be issued shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the City of Acworth within the meaning of Ga. Const. art. IX, § VII, ¶ I, nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said city, nor shall the city be subject to any pecuniary liability thereon. The revenue bonds shall not be payable from, nor a charge upon, any funds of the city. Any bondholder shall have the right to compel the authority to levy the special tax herein provided for within the limit herein prescribed to pay the bonds and interest thereon; provided, however, that any resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds or any trust agreement, trust indenture, or similar agreement approved by the authority may provide that no bondholder shall have any such right to compel levy of a tax, and, in that event, the authority may not and shall not levy any tax to pay the bonds which are the subject of any such resolution, trust agreement, trust indenture, or similar agreement or interest thereon. 
                  (i)  The authority is hereby authorized to issue revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations from time to time to carry out the purposes of this paragraph. Revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations so issued shall be paid solely from the revenues pledged to the payment thereof, which revenues may include any funds derived from the special tax levy provided hereunder. Such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the governing body of the authority, which may be adopted at a regular or special meeting by a majority vote of the members of said governing body. The governing body of said authority in determining the cost of any project for which revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations are to be issued may include all costs relative to the issuance thereof and, without intending to limit such costs, may include architectural, engineering, inspection, fiscal agents', and legal expenses estimated to accrue from the date of any revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations through the period of construction and for six months after such construction; and such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, not exceeding 30 years from their respective dates, bear interest at such rate or rates, and may be in such denominations and may carry such registration privileges and be subject to redemption and may contain such terms, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations may provide. Revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations and interest thereon so issued by said authority are hereby declared to be tax exempt for any and all purposes. The terms, conditions, covenants, and provisions contained in any such resolution authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind said governing body then in office and its successors thereof, including any covenant to levy taxes within the limits herein prescribed for the purpose of providing such funds as may be necessary to pay the principal of and interest on any such issue or issues of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations and to create and maintain a reserve for that purpose. Such bonds, but not notes or other obligations, issued by said authority shall be validated in the Superior Court of Cobb County in the same manner as revenue bonds of municipalities are validated as provided under the Revenue Bond Law (1937 Ga. Laws, p. 761), as amended. There shall be no limitation upon the amount of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations which the authority may issue. The interest rate or rates on or to be borne by any revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by the authority shall be determined by the members of the authority; and any limitations with respect to interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates found in the Revenue Bond Law (1937 Ga. Laws, p. 761), as amended, the usury laws of the State of Georgia, or any other laws of the State of Georgia shall not apply to revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority issued pursuant to this paragraph. The members of the authority for purposes of the Revenue Bond Law shall constitute the "governing body," as that term is used herein. 
                  (j)  For purposes of validation of revenue bonds as provided under the Revenue Bond Law (1937 Ga. Laws, p. 761), as amended, the authority shall be considered to be located in the City of Acworth, Cobb County, Georgia. 
                  (k)  The authority may provide for the replacement of any bonds issued by it which shall be lost, mutilated, or destroyed. 
                  (l)  In the discretion of the authority, any issue of bonds pursuant to this paragraph may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a trustee, which may be any trust company, any bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside the state, any national banking association organized under the laws of the United States, or an individual. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, rents, receipts, earnings, or other funds to be received by the authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale from time to time of any surplus property of the authority, either real or personal. The resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds or the trust indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may prescribe the procedure by which bondholders may enforce their rights. Such resolution or trust indenture may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects satisfactory to the trustee or to the bondholders, and may also require that the security given by any contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such trustee or bondholders, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued pari passu with the revenue bonds initially issued pursuant to such resolution or trust indenture. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state or any national banking association organized under the laws of the United States to act as such depository and to furnish such security as may be required by the authority. All expenses incurred in connection with any such resolution or trust indenture may be treated as operating expenses of the authority. This subparagraph is illustrative and does not limit the types of instruments which may secure or provide for any issue of bonds or the terms and provisions which any resolution adopted by the authority or any instrument executed by the authority may contain. Any resolution adopted by the authority or any indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument executed by the authority may contain such terms and provisions as the authority shall approve. Such approval of the authority shall be conclusively established by the execution of any such resolution, indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument by the chairman or vice-chairman of the authority and the attestation of such execution by the secretary or any assistant secretary of the authority. Nothing herein shall be construed to require, for any issue of revenue bonds, a trustee or a trust indenture, trust agreement, or similar instrument. 
                  (m)  In addition to and not in limitation of other powers granted in this paragraph as to the issuance of revenue bonds and security for such bonds, the authority shall have the power to enter into any financial and contractual arrangements which it deems appropriate with users or owners of projects in order to provide security to bondholders; and for such purposes it may also enter into joint agreements, arrangements, or trust indentures with such users or owners and a trustee or trustees under any trust indenture in order that funds may be procured to accomplish the purposes of this paragraph. 
                  (n)  While any of the revenue bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will adversely affect the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds. 
                  (o)  All revenue bonds of the authority issued under the provisions of this paragraph are declared to be issued for an essential public purpose and the said bonds and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within the state. 
                  (p)  Any revenue bonds issued by the authority under the provisions of this paragraph are hereby made securities in which all public officers and bodies of this state and all municipalities and all municipal subdivisions, all insurance companies and associations and other persons carrying on an insurance business, all banks, bankers, trust companies, savings banks and savings associations, including savings and loan associations, building and loan associations, investment companies and other persons carrying on a banking business, all administrators, guardians, executors, trustees and other fiduciaries and all other persons whomsoever who are now or may hereafter be authorized to invest in bonds or other obligations of the state may properly and legally invest funds including capital in their control or belonging to them. The revenue bonds of the authority are also hereby made securities which may be deposited with and shall be received by all public officers and bodies of this state and all municipalities and municipal subdivisions for any purpose for which the deposit of the bonds or other obligations of this state is now or may hereafter be authorized. 
                  (q)  The purpose of the authority is the redevelopment of the downtown Acworth district, which includes but is not limited to renovation and rehabilitation of existing buildings, structures, and improvements and acquisition and construction of new buildings, structures, and improvements located in the downtown Acworth district, all for any commercial, business, office, public, or other use determined by a majority of the members of the authority to further the redevelopment of the downtown Acworth district. The purpose of the authority is hereby declared to be an essential and public purpose, promoting the public good and welfare and benefiting the citizens of the downtown Acworth district and the City of Acworth. This paragraph shall be liberally construed to effect its purpose. 
                  (r)  It is hereby declared that all property of the authority held pursuant to the terms of this paragraph, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, and of any kind or nature, and any income or revenue therefrom, is held for an essential public purpose and all such property is deemed to be public property and tax exempt.

                      As used in this act, the term "authority" means the Acworth Downtown Development Authority.

                  (a)  Executive sessions of the mayor and board of aldermen may be held for the purpose of conducting business excepted from public access requirements as authorized by O.C.G.A. §§ 50-14-2 and 50-14-3. Where a meeting of the mayor and board of aldermen is devoted in part to matters within the authorized exceptions to public access requirements, any portion of the meeting not subject to any such exceptions shall be open to the public. No executive session shall be held except pursuant to a majority affirmative vote of the mayor and board of aldermen taken in a public meeting. 
                  (b)  The minutes of the public meeting shall reflect the names of the aldermen present, those voting for the executive session and the specific reasons for the executive session. Minutes of the executive session may be maintained by the city clerk at the direction of the mayor. Any such minutes shall be maintained in a confidential file and shall not be subject to disclosure; except that disclosures of such portions of minutes identifying real estate to be acquired by the mayor and board of aldermen may only be delayed until such time as the acquisition of the real estate has been completed, terminated or abandoned or court proceedings have been initiated. 
                  Sec. 2-36. - Voting; majority.

Unless otherwise specified in these procedures, a majority shall mean more than half of the aldermen present, excluding abstentions. Where a two-thirds majority is specified, a majority vote shall mean at least two-thirds of the aldermen present, excluding abstentions. In the event of a tie vote, the mayor shall vote break the tie. 
                  Sec. 2-37. - Abstentions. 
                      An alderman shall vote on all motions unless he has a conflict of interest that would prevent him from making a decision in a fair and legal manner. If a conflict of interest does exist, the alderman shall explain for the record his decision to abstain on any vote. 
                  Sec. 2-38. - Agenda. 
                  (a)  The city manager, with the advice of the mayor and the aldermen, shall prepare an agenda of subjects to be acted on for each meeting. 
                  (b)  The order of the agenda may be changed during a meeting by a majority vote of the board of aldermen. A new subject that requires urgent attention may be added to the agenda during a meeting by a two-thirds vote of the board of aldermen. 
                  (c)  A copy of the agenda and a list of those members present shall be made available to the public for inspection within two business days of the adjournment of any meeting. 
                  Sec. 2-39. - Consent agenda. 
                  (a)  A consent agenda may be prepared by the city manager for the mayor and board of aldermen to unanimously adopt motions on routine items. Any items of business that are expected to receive unanimous approval and where no debate is expected may be placed on a consent agenda. 
                  (b)  If an alderman objects to an item being on the consent agenda, the mayor shall move that particular item to the regular agenda. If an aldermen does not object to an item on the consent agenda, the mayor will ask for unanimous approval of the items on the consent agenda. If there are no objections, all the items on the consent agenda will be adopted by unanimous consent. 
                  Sec. 2-40. - Minutes. 
                  (a)  The city clerk shall promptly record the minutes for each meeting of the mayor and board of aldermen. The minutes serve as the official written record of the mayor and board of aldermen meeting and shall be open for public inspection once approved as official by the mayor and board of aldermen but in no case later than immediately following the next regular meeting of the mayor and board of aldermen. The minutes shall specify the names of aldermen present at the meeting, a description of each motion or other proposal made at the meeting, the alderman who proposed each motion, the alderman who seconded each motion, and a record of all votes. In the case of a roll-call vote, the name of each alderman voting for or against a proposal shall be recorded. It shall be presumed that an alderman has voted in the affirmative unless the minutes show otherwise. More detailed information may be included in the minutes at the request of the mayor and board of aldermen. 
                  (b)  The mayor and board of aldermen must approve the minutes before they can be considered as an official record of the mayor and board of aldermen. A copy of the minutes from the previous meeting shall be distributed to the aldermen at least one business day before the following meeting. The minutes of the previous meeting shall be corrected and approved by the mayor and board of aldermen at the beginning of each meeting. A majority vote is required for approval. Conflicts about the content of the minutes shall be decided by majority vote. Upon being approved, the minutes shall be signed by the mayor and attested to by the city clerk. 
                  Sec. 2-41. - Order of business. 
                      All regular meetings of the mayor and board of aldermen shall follow an established order of business. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-021, 7-18-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-42. - Decorum. 
                  (a)  All aldermen must conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. All remarks should be directed to the mayor and not to individual aldermen, staff or citizens in attendance. Personal remarks are inappropriate. An alderman is not allowed to speak at a meeting until he has been recognized by the mayor. All comments made by an alderman shall address the motion that is being discussed. 
                  (b)  The mayor shall enforce these rules of decorum. If an alderman believes that a rule has been broken, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The mayor can rule on the question or he may allow the board of aldermen to debate the issue and decide the issue by majority vote. 
                  Sec. 2-43. - Public participation. 
                      Public participation in meetings of the mayor and board of aldermen shall be permitted in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
                  (1)  Public comments. The public will be afforded two opportunities to address the mayor and board of aldermen at each meeting, once at the beginning and once at the end of the meeting. Individuals will be allotted five minutes to make their comments, and their comments must be limited to their chosen topic. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the mayor and board of aldermen. 
                  (2)  Public participation on agenda items. By a majority vote, the mayor and board of aldermen may allow public comment on an agenda item at the time the item is being considered by the mayor and board of aldermen. These comments must be limited to the subject that is being debated. Members of the public may speak for two minutes and may only speak once. These limits may be waived by a majority vote of the mayor and board of aldermen. Anyone wishing to speak at any meeting of the board of aldermen must be recognized by the mayor before addressing the board of aldermen. 
                  (3)  Decorum. Members of the public shall not make inappropriate or offensive comments at a meeting of the mayor and board of aldermen and are expected to comply with the rules of decorum that are established for aldermen. Individuals who violate any rules of the mayor and board of aldermen may be ruled out of order by the mayor or on a point of order made by an alderman. A majority vote of the mayor and board of aldermen will rule on the point of order. An individual who violates the rules of decorum may be removed from the meeting at the direction of the mayor. 
                  (4)  Public hearings. The mayor and board of aldermen may schedule public hearings for the purpose of soliciting public comment on any subject of interest to the mayor and board of aldermen. Hearings may be held immediately prior to or following a meeting of the mayor and board of aldermen or at such other places and times as the mayor and board of aldermen may determine. 
                  Sec. 2-44. - Amendments to rules. 
                      Any amendments to the rules of order must be submitted by an alderman in writing to the city manager three business days before a regular meeting of the mayor and board of aldermen. The proposed amendment shall be included in the agenda for that meeting and distributed to all aldermen. All amendments require a two-thirds vote of the mayor and board of aldermen to be adopted. 
                  Sec. 2-45. - Suspending the rules of order. 
                      Rules of order may be suspended in the case of an emergency. A motion to suspend the rules requires a second, is debatable and requires a two-thirds vote of the mayor and board of aldermen. Rules governing quorum, voting methods and requirements, the notification to aldermen of meetings, and rules necessary for compliance with state law cannot be suspended. 
                  Secs. 2-46—2-70. - Reserved. 
                  DIVISION 2. - PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE 

                  Sec. 2-71. - Rules of procedure. 
                      Unless otherwise provided in this Code, procedures for meetings of the mayor and board of aldermen shall follow an edition of Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised, prescribed by the mayor. 
                  Sec. 2-72. - Parliamentarian. 
                      The city attorney shall serve as the parliamentarian for mayor and board of aldermen meetings. 
                  Sec. 2-73. - Main motion. 
                      In order for the mayor and board of aldermen to take any official action on any subject, an alderman must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chair until another alderman agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the alderman seconding the motion to support the motion. An alderman may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the mayor and board of aldermen has voted on that motion. 
                  Sec. 2-74. - Debate. 
                  (a)  After the main motion is recognized by the chair, the mayor and board of aldermen shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the mayor in a manner that is fair to each alderman. Aldermen may participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the mayor. 
                  (b)  During the course of debate, aldermen may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the mayor and board of aldermen take a particular action on a motion. There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. 
                  (c)  Aldermen may also introduce privileged motions. Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions. 
                  Sec. 2-75. - Voting; procedure. 
                      Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: 
                  a.  If debate has been completed and no other alderman wishes to speak, the chair can call for the vote. If there are no objections, the chair can proceed with the vote; 
                  b.  If the mayor calls for the vote and there is an objection, an alderman may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a two-thirds vote, debate will stop. The mayor will then read the proposed motion to the board of aldermen and ask for the votes of the aldermen. 
                  (2)  Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chair. The mayor shall read the proposed motion to the board of aldermen and then call for the vote. 
                  Sec. 2-76. - Ranking of motions. 
                  (a)  Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the mayor and board of aldermen returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. 
                  (b)  A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list. 
                  (1)  Main motion (lowest rank). 
                  (2)  Subsidiary motions (debatable): 
                  a.  Postpone indefinitely. 
                  b.  Amend. 
                  c.  Refer to committee (commit). 
                  d.  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). 
                  (3)  Subsidiary motions (undebatable): 
                  a.  Limit debate or extend limits. 
                  b.  Vote immediately (previous question). 
                  c.  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). 
                  (4)  Privileged motions (undebatable): 
                  a.  Question of privilege. 
                  b.  Recess. 
                  c.  Adjourn (highest rank). 
                  Sec. 2-77. - Subsidiary motions. 
                      During the course of debate, aldermen may introduce motions that propose that the mayor and board of aldermen take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow the mayor and board of aldermen to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions—amend, limit debate and vote immediately—also may apply to other subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)  Postpone indefinitely. If an alderman believes that the main motion should not be considered by the mayor and board of aldermen, that alderman may move to postpone the consideration of the main motions indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely may be debated, but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)  Amend. If an alderman believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. 
                  a.  Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. 
                  b.  Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. 
                  c.  A motion cannot be amended more than two times. 
                  d.  Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. 
                  e.  A majority vote is required for the mayor and board of aldermen to adopt an amendment. 
                  f.  If the amendment is adopted, the mayor and board of aldermen shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)  Refer to a committee (commit). If an alderman believes that further information is needed before the mayor and board of aldermen can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date the committee or department will report back to the mayor and board of aldermen. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (4)  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if an alderman believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the mayor will bring the original motion back to the mayor and board of aldermen for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)  Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the alderman who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and a two-thirds vote is required. 
                  (6)  Vote immediately (previous question). If an alderman believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the alderman may move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable, and a vote of two-thirds of the mayor and board of aldermen is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (7)  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the mayor and board of aldermen during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  Sec. 2-78. - Privileged motions. 
                      Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
                  (1)  Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chair concerning the rights of an alderman or of the mayor and board of aldermen as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chair is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)  Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion, but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)  Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, an alderman must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion, and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  Sec. 2-79. - Incidental motions. 
                      Incidental motions allow aldermen to exert their rights as a member of the mayor and board of aldermen. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)  Appeal. If an alderman disagrees with a decision that is made by the chair, that alderman may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the mayor and board of aldermen. The chair has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The mayor and board of aldermen may then debate the appeal. The mayor and board of aldermen shall decide by majority vote if the chair's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)  Parliamentary inquiry. If an alderman has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chair to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the mayor and board of aldermen. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)  Point of order (question of order). If an alderman believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chair can make a ruling on the question or can allow the mayor and board of aldermen to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)  Point of information (request for information). If an alderman has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chair and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required, and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
                  Sec. 2-80. - Supplementary main motions. 
                      Three motions allow the mayor and board of aldermen to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the mayor and board of aldermen. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified. 
                  (1)  Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the mayor and board of aldermen to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the mayor and board of aldermen to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any alderman may make a motion to reconsider, and any alderman may second the motion. The motion is debatable, but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the mayor and board of aldermen is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided; and the mayor and board of aldermen will return to debate and revote the original motion. 
                  (2)  Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the mayor and board of aldermen overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any alderman. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the alderman seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-39. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made.

In case of the death of any natural person holding a city business license, or any interest in such license, the license may be transferred to the administrator, executor of the lawful heir or devisee of the deceased person by filing a new application with the city for the change in license ownership within 75 days of such death. The business involved may continue to operate until disposition of the application is determined as for an original license. No additional fees or business taxes shall be charged above what would be due if the business, or portion thereof, remained under the deceased person's ownership.

                  (a)  The mayor and the board of aldermen finds as follows: 
                  (1)  According to numerous public health research studies, alcohol remains the number one drug of choice among young people in the United States. 
                  (2)  "The Surgeon General's Call to Action To Prevent and Reduce Underage Drinking," which can be found at http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/topics/underagedrinking/calltoaction.pdf., cites a comprehensive body of facts that demonstrate the risks to communities from underage drinking; they include the following: 
                  a.  "Early alcohol consumption by some young people will result in an alcohol use disorder—that is, they will meet diagnostic criteria for either alcohol abuse or dependence." (page 4) 
                  b.  "While adolescents typically drink alcoholic beverages less often than adults, when they do drink alcoholic beverages, adolescents tend to drink more alcoholic beverages at each event than adults." (pages 6—7) 
                  c.  "Annually, about 5,000 people under age 21 die from alcohol-related injuries involving underage drinking." (page 10) 
                  d.  "Underage drinking "can cause alterations in the structure and function of the developing brain, which continues to mature into the mid—to late twenties and may have consequences reaching far beyond adolescence." (page 11) 
                  e.  "Underage drinking "can cause a range of physical consequences, from hangovers to death from alcohol poisoning." (page 11) 
                  The Surgeon General's Report also identifies alcohol as a contributing factor in many activities that place others as well as the underage alcohol user at risk. These activities include physical and sexual assault, risky sexual behavior, loud and unruly behavior, property damage, unintentional injuries, violence, and even death. For example, "about 45 percent of people who die in car crashes involving a drinking driver under the age of 21 are people other than the driver." (page 11) 
                  (b)  Moreover, the mayor and the board of aldermen finds as follows: 
                  (1)  Persons who are less than the age of 21 often possess or consume alcoholic beverages at social parties or gatherings held at or on private residences and other private property under control of a person who either has provided the alcoholic beverages or who knows or reasonably should know of such conduct, but fails to take steps to prevent it. 
                  (2)  Law enforcement agency responses to disturbances involving underage consumption of alcoholic beverages at parties or gatherings at or on private residences or other private property frequently require the use of extensive public resources. 
                  (3)  Further, when law enforcement personnel respond to such disturbances it limits their ability to respond to other service calls in the community, thereby placing the community at increased risk. Law enforcement is not currently reimbursed for their expenses when called to a party or gathering at or on a private residence or other private property. 
                  (c)  As such, the mayor and the board of aldermen declare as follows: 
                  (1)  Protecting health and safety in the city is a reasonable cause to deter the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons under the age of 21. It is also reasonable and prudent to do by holding responsible persons who encourage, are aware of, or should be aware of, the illegal conduct, yet fail to take steps to prevent it. 
                  (2)  Further, there is data to demonstrate that public efforts to deter the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons under the age of 21 will result in significant costs savings with regard to law enforcement (citation and prosecution), healthcare (i.e., emergency room treatment)) and rehabilitation (addiction and recovery). As such, the revenue received by the city, after cost reimbursement to responding law enforcement agencies, will be directed toward law enforcement strategies and prevention programs in the city.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 10-41. - Findings; public purpose; legal authority. 
                  (a)  Based upon the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, which experiences the city believes are relevant to the problems faced by the city, the city takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the country. Moreover, it is the finding of the board of aldermen that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of such criminal behavior, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare, and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. This article is further adopted based upon specific evidence related to one of the clubs in Marietta, the Cyprus Lounge, which evidence is contained under table 1 of the information reviewed by the board of aldermen prior to this article. To that end, this article is adopted. 
                  (b)  This article is also adopted pursuant to the authority granted by Ga. Const. art. III, § VI, ¶ VII. 
                  (c)  This article is further adopted to protect the public safety, health and welfare. 
                  (d)  This article is further adopted pursuant to the police power of the city.

                  Sec. 10-42. - Purpose. 
                      The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including but not limited to adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  (2)  Located inside an accessory structure. Such accessory structure shall be constructed on a concrete pad and shall be completely enclosed and roofed over with elevations and materials to match the buildings they serve. One side of the enclosure shall contain a gate, to afford access as necessary, provided such a gate shall be made to act as a blind, which completely screens the device or container from view. Metallic or plastic fencing material, with or without slats inserted, shall not be used as part of the gate. Prior to construction, the plans for all such accessory structures must be reviewed and approved by the Acworth zoning and building departments. All such enclosures and their gates shall be properly maintained and kept in good working order. 
                      All such existing grease collection devices and grease storage containers utilized in Acworth's downtown business district, (bounded by Lemon Street and Morningside Drive, and Main Street and Senator Richard B.

                  Sec. 18-40. - Site retaining walls. 
                  (a)  Permitting. Retaining walls which do not exceed four feet in vertical height, as measured from the low side exposed toe of the wall to the top of the wall at any point, shall not require permitting provided that the slope of the backfill materials does not exceed 1 in 3 (one foot rise for every three feet of run). In addition, such walls must not support soils, which in turn will support any portion of any structure (except for detached utility structures of 120 square feet or less). 
                      Retaining walls, which exceed four feet in height at any point along the wall, shall require permitting. 
                      All retaining walls, regardless of height, which support soils that are in turn supporting any portion of a structure, other than detached utility structures of 120 square feet of less, shall require building permits. 
                      All walls designed for water retention as part of a stormwater management plan, shall be under the jurisdiction of the Acworth Public Works Department. 
                  (b)  Design. All retaining walls supporting soils that are in turn supporting any portion of a structure, other than detached utility structures of 120 square feet of less, shall require a stamped, sealed design by a Georgia Registered Engineer. 
                      All walls supporting backfill materials sloping in excess of 1 in 3 (one foot rise for every three feet of run), shall require a stamped, sealed design by a Georgia Registered Engineer. 
                      Other walls may be constructed in accordance with the building department's approved standard details, kept on file, or they shall require a stamped, sealed design by a Georgia Registered Engineer. 
                  (c)  Materials. No wood materials may be used in retaining walls with the exception that pressure preservatively treated wood (suitable for continual ground contact use), may be used in walls four feet or less in height; provided that they do not support soils that are in turn supporting any portion of a structure (other than detached utility structures of 120 square feet of less) nor support backfill materials sloping in excess of 1 in 3 (one foot rise for every three feet of run). 
                  (d)  Locations. Regardless of their height, retaining walls must always be located away from other retaining walls a distance of 1.5 times their maximum height (as measured from the low side exposed toe of the wall to the top of the wall at any point). Otherwise they shall require a stamped, sealed design by a Georgia Registered Engineer taking into account the loading imposed by such adjacent walls. 
                      All retaining walls and their required components (including "dead men", geo-textile materials, drain piping, etc.) shall be located entirely on a single parcel of land and shall not cross over any property lines. Exception: Retaining walls located to the rear of buildings or residences may cross over property lines provided that such a crossing is roughly perpendicular to the property line, which it crosses. In such cases, separate permits will be required for each parcel of land on which the wall is to be constructed. Such walls do not need to be broken at the property line, but may be continuous. Such walls shall never support soils that are in turn supporting any portion of a structure, other than detached utility structures of 120 square feet of less. 
                      No retaining walls shall cross creeks, drainage easements, or other water courses without the approval of the Acworth Public Works Department. 
                      All walls designed for water retention, as part of a stormwater management plan, shall be under the jurisdiction of the Acworth Public Works Department. 
                  (e)  Inspections. Inspection of permitted retaining walls shall occur before any concrete, backfill material, drainage material, etc. is placed in such a way as to conceal any other required components of the wall (such as "dead men", geo-textile fabric, drain piping, etc.). This will necessitate at least several inspections, in progressive stages, as the construction of the wall proceeds. At the discretion of the building department, a qualified third party may perform such inspections provided that a letter, signed and sealed by a Georgia Registered Engineer and certifying compliance with all applicable codes and designs, is submitted to the department after the completion of the wall. 
                  (f)  Permit fees. Permit fees shall be calculated the same as for buildings within their appropriate class of construction, either residential or commercial.

                  (b)  Federal and state authority. The provisions of the construction codes shall not be held to deprive any federal or state agency, or any applicable governing authority having jurisdiction, of any power or authority which it had on the effective date of the adoption of the construction codes or of any remedy then existing for the enforcement of its orders, nor shall it deprive any individual or corporation of its legal rights as provided by law. 
                  (c)  Referenced standards. Standards referenced in the text of the construction codes are considered an integral part of the construction codes. If specific portions of a standard are denoted by code text, only those portions of the standard [are] enforced. Where construction code provisions conflict with a standard, the construction code provisions are enforced. Permissive and advisory provisions in a standard shall not be construed as mandatory. 
                  (d)  Maintenance. All buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, and plumbing systems, both existing and new, and all parts thereof, shall be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition.

This officer or employee shall not engage in any other work, which is inconsistent with his duties or conflict with the interests of the department. 
                  [2]  Liability. Any officer or employee charged with the enforcement of the construction codes, acting for the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his duties, shall not thereby render himself personally liable, and is hereby relieved from all personal liability, for any damage that may occur to persons or property as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his duties. Any suit brought against any officer or employee or member because of such act performed by him in the enforcement of any provision of the construction codes are defended by the governing jurisdiction until the final termination of the proceedings.

                  (a)  Generally. Alterations, repairs, or rehabilitation work may be made to any existing structure, building, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system without requiring the building, structure, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, or gas system to comply with all the requirements of the construction codes provided that the alteration, repair, or rehabilitation work conforms to the requirements of the construction codes for new construction. The building official shall determine the extent to which the existing system is made to conform to the requirements of the construction codes for new construction. 
                  (b)  Change of occupancy. If the occupancy classification of any existing building or structure is changed, the building, electrical, gas, mechanical, and plumbing systems shall be made to conform to the intent of the construction codes for new construction as required by the building official. 
                  (c)  Special historic buildings. The provisions of the construction codes relating to the construction, alteration, repair, enlargement, restoration, relocation, or moving of buildings or structures shall not be mandatory for existing buildings or structures identified and classified by the federal, state or local jurisdiction as historic buildings when such buildings or structures are judged by the building official to be safe and in the public interest of health, safety, and welfare regarding any proposed construction, alteration, repair, enlargement, restoration, relocation, or moving of buildings within the fire districts.

                  (a)  Generally. When reference is made to the authorities or duties of certain officials named in the various construction codes adopted by this article, the designated building official, shall be deemed to be the responsible official for the enforcement of such codes. The building official is hereby authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of the construction codes. The building official is further authorized to render interpretations of the construction codes, which are consistent with its intent and purpose. 
                  (b)  Right of entry. 
                  (1)  Necessary enforcement of provisions. Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of the construction codes, or whenever the building official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon any premises any condition or code violation which makes such building, structure, sign, premises, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems unsafe, dangerous, or hazardous, the building official may enter such building, structure, or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed upon the building official by these construction codes, provided that if such building or premises is occupied, he shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building, structure, or premises is unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such and request entry. If entry is refused, the building official shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry. 
                  (2)  Legal authority to enter. When the building official shall have first obtained legal authority to secure entry, no owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the building official for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to the construction codes. 
                  (c)  Stop work orders. Upon notice from the building official, work on any building, structure, sign, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system that is being done contrary to the provisions of the construction codes, or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, shall immediately cease. Such notice is in writing and is given to the owner of the property, or to his agent, or to the person doing the work, or posted on the property. Where an emergency exists, the Building Official shall not be required to give a written notice prior to stopping the work. 
                  (d)  Revocation of permits. 
                  (1)  Misrepresentation of application. The building official may revoke a permit or approval, issued under the provisions of the construction codes, in a case where there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or plans on which the permit or approval was based. 
                  (2)  Violation of code provisions. The building official may revoke a permit upon determination that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation or replacement of the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of the construction codes. 
                  (e)  Unsafe buildings or systems. All buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems which are unsafe, unsanitary, or do not provide adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use constitute a hazard to safety or health, are considered unsafe buildings or service systems. 
                  (f)  Requirements not covered by Code. Any requirements necessary for the strength, stability, or proper operation of an existing or proposed building, structure, sign, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system, or for the public safety, health, and general welfare, not specifically covered by or the construction codes, shall be determined by the building official. 
                  (g)  Alternate materials and methods. The provisions of the construction codes are not intended to prevent the use of any material or method of construction not specifically prescribed by them, provided any such alternate has been reviewed by the building official. The building official shall approve any such alternate, provided the building official finds that the alternate for the purpose intended is at least the equivalent of that prescribed in the construction codes, in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability, and safety. The building official shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted to substantiate any claim made regarding the alternate. 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-17, § 1, 7-21-2011) 
                  Sec. 18-56. - Permits. 
                  (a)  Permit application. 
                  (1)  Permitting required. When required, any owner, authorized agent, or contractor who desires to construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish, or change the occupancy of a building or structure, or to erect, install, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, convert, or replace any sign, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system, the installation of which is regulated by the construction codes, or to cause any such work to be done, shall first make application to the building official and obtain the required permit for the work. 
                  (2)  Work authorized. A building, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing permit shall carry with it the right to construct or install the work, provided the same are shown and clearly detailed on the drawings and set forth in the specifications filed with the application for the permit. Where these are not shown clearly on the drawings and covered by the specifications submitted with the application, the building official may determine compliance with applicable code provisions upon inspection in the field, or may require revised plans, permits or even separate permits as necessary. 
                  (3)  Minor repairs. Ordinary minor repairs may be made with the approval of the building official without a permit, provided that such repairs shall not violate any of the provisions of the construction codes or other city ordinances. 
                  (4)  Information required. Each application for a permit, with the required fee, shall be filed with the building official on a form furnished for that purpose, and shall contain a general description of the proposed work and its location. The application is signed by the contractor or owner responsible for performing the work, or their authorized agent. The building permit application shall indicate the proposed occupancy of all parts of the building and of that portion of the site or lot, if any, not covered by the building or structure, and shall contain such other information as may be required by the building official. 
                  (5)  Time limitations. An application for a permit for any proposed work is deemed to have been abandoned six months after the date of filing for the permit, unless before then a permit has been issued. One or more extensions of time for periods of not more than 90 days each may be allowed by the building official for the application provided the extension is requested in writing and justifiable cause is demonstrated. 
                  (b)  Drawings and specifications. 
                  (1)  Requirements. When required by the building official, two or more copies of specifications and of drawings drawn to scale with sufficient clarity and detail to indicate the nature and character of the work shall accompany the application for a permit, including the height of any proposed structure. Such drawings and specifications shall contain information, in the form of notes or otherwise, as to the quality of materials, where quality is essential to conformity with the construction codes. Such information is specific, and the construction codes shall not be cited as a whole or in part, nor shall the term "legal," or its equivalent, be used as a substitute for specific information. All information, drawings, specifications and accompanying data shall bear the name and signature of the person responsible for the design. 
                  (2)  Additional data. The building official may require details, computations, stress diagrams, and other data necessary to describe the construction or installation and the basis of calculations. All drawings, specifications, and accompanying data required by the building official to be prepared by an architect or engineer shall be affixed with their official seal. 
                  (3)  Design professional. The design professional shall be an architect or engineer legally registered under the laws of this state regulating the practice of architecture or engineering and shall affix his official seal to said drawings, specifications, and accompanying data, for the following:

                  c.  Buildings and structures 5,000 square feet (465 m 2 ) or more in area. 
                  d.  For all other buildings and structures, the submittal shall bear the certification of the applicant that some specific state law exception permits its preparation by a person not so registered. 
                  (4)  Exception. In general, single-family dwellings, regardless of size, shall require neither a registered architect nor engineer, nor a certification that an architect or engineer is not required. When the building official has concerns about the structural adequacy or life safety of specific aspects of the design, an engineer or architect may be required to review and/or modify, and then approve the design of such areas, prior to the building official's acceptance. 
                  (5)  Structural and fire resistance integrity. Plans for all buildings shall indicate how required structural and fire resistance integrity will be maintained where a penetration of a required fire resistance wall, floor, or partition will be made for electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing, signal and communication conduits, pipes, and systems and also indicate in sufficient detail how the fire integrity will be maintained where required fire resistance floors or ceilings intersect the exterior walls. 
                  (6)  Site drawings. Drawings shall show the location of the proposed building or structure and of every existing building or structure on the site or lot. The building official may require a boundary line survey prepared by a qualified surveyor.

                  a.  General site plan. A general site plan drawn at a legible scale which shall include, but not be limited to, the location of all buildings, exterior storage facilities, permanent access ways, evacuation routes, parking lots, internal roads, chemical loading areas, equipment cleaning areas, storm and sanitary sewer accesses, emergency equipment, and adjacent property uses. The exterior storage areas are identified with the hazard classes and the maximum quantities per hazard class of hazardous materials stored. 
                  b.  Building floor plan. A building floor plan drawn to a legible scale, which shall include, but not be limited to, all hazardous materials storage facilities within the building and shall indicate rooms, doorways, corridors, exits, fire-rated assemblies with their hourly rating, location of liquid tight rooms, and evacuation routes. Each hazardous materials storage facility is identified on the plan with the hazard classes and quantity range per hazard class or the hazardous materials stored. 
                  (c)  Examination of documents. 
                  (1)  Plan review. The building official shall examine or cause to be examined each application for a permit and the accompanying documents, consisting of drawings, specifications, computations, and additional data, and shall ascertain by such examinations whether the construction indicated and described is in accordance with the requirements of the construction codes and all other pertinent laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  Affidavits. The building official may accept a sworn affidavit from a registered architect or engineer stating that the plans submitted conform to the construction codes. For buildings and structures, the affidavit shall state that the plans conform to the laws as to egress, type of construction, and general arrangement and if accompanied by drawings showing the structural design, and by a statement that the plans and design conform to the requirements of the construction codes as to strength, stresses, strains, loads, and stability. The building official may without any examination or inspection accept such affidavit, provided the architect or engineer who made such affidavit agrees to submit to the building official, copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed and upon completion of the structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems a certification that the structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system has been erected in accordance with the requirements of the construction codes. Where the building official relies upon such affidavit, the architect or engineer shall assume full responsibility for the compliance with all provisions of the construction codes and other pertinent laws or ordinances. 
                  (d)  Issuing permits. 
                  (1)  Action on permits. The building official shall act upon an application for a permit without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. If the building official is satisfied that the work described in an application for a permit and the contract documents filed therewith conform to the requirements of the construction codes and other pertinent laws and ordinances, he shall issue a permit to the applicant. 
                  (2)  Refusal to issue a permit. If the application for a permit and the accompanying contract documents describing the work do not conform to the requirements of the construction codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the building official shall not issue a permit, but shall return the contract documents to the applicant with his refusal to issue such permit. Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. 
                  (3)  Special foundation permit. When application for a permit to erect or enlarge a building or structure has been filed and pending issuance of such permit, the building official may, at his discretion, issue a special permit for the foundation only. The holder of such a special permit is proceeding at his own risk and without assurance that a permit for the remainder of the work will be granted nor that corrections will not be required in order to meet provisions of the construction codes. 
                  (4)  Public right-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the building official for the construction of any building or structure, or for the alteration of any building or structure where said building or structure is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies, or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley, or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless the applicant has confirmed the location of the public right-of-way lines, and it is the duty of the building official to see that the street lines are not encroached upon except as provided for by code or ordinance. 
                  (e)  Contractor responsibilities. It is the duty of every contractor who shall make contracts for the installation or repairs of buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, sprinkler, or plumbing systems, for which a permit is required, to comply with state or local rules and regulations concerning licensing which the applicable governing authority may have adopted. In such case that the state requires a contractor to have obtained a state license before he is permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the local government with its license number before receiving a permit for work to be performed. 
                  (f)  Conditions of the permit. 
                  (1)  Permit intent. A permit issued is construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes. All permits expire six months after the last required inspection that has been passed, or six months after the date of issue if no required inspections have been approved. The building official may issue a six-month extension of any permit, for due cause, if requested in writing by the permit holder prior to such a permit expiring. The extension of any permit may require the payment of a fee. 
                  (2)  Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they are responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official a written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his place, a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed and approved by the building official. 
                  (3)  Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "reviewed for code compliance" or "approved" or similar. One set of drawings so reviewed is retained by the building official and the other set is returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings are to be kept at the site of work and open to inspection by the building official or his authorized representative during all times workers are present. 
                  (g)  Fees. 
                  (1)  Prescribed fees. A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed by the building department have been paid. Nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, has been paid. Permit and inspection fees and any other charges imposed or due under the various construction codes adopted by this article shall be as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk. 
                  (2)  Work commencing before permit issuance.

                  (3)  Accounting. The building official shall keep a permanent and accurate accounting of all permit fees and other money collected, the names of all persons upon whose account the same was paid, along with the date and amount thereof. 
                  (4)  Schedule of permit fees. On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit is paid as required at the time of filing application or once the permit is ready for issuance, in accordance with the fee schedules as set by the building department. 
                  (5)  Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing systems, etc. appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include the total cost of the building, electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing, equipment, and other systems, as required to erect and complete the building, dwelling or structure; including design fees, connection to utilities, site work necessary for foundation installation, materials, labor, overhead and profit. If any of the costs involved are discounted due to the use of used materials, or when labor and/or materials have been traded for some other goods or services (in whole or in part), the normal, undiscounted costs shall be used for the purpose of determining the cost (valuation) of construction in order to determine the permit fees. 
                  (h)  Inspections. 
                  (1)  Existing buildings. Before issuing a permit, the building official may examine or cause to be examined any building, electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing systems, etc. for which an application has been received for a permit to enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish, install, or change the occupancy. He shall inspect all buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, and plumbing systems, from time to time, during and upon completion of the work for which a permit was issued. He shall make a record of every such examination and inspection and of all violations of the construction codes. 
                  (2)  Manufacturers and fabricators. When deemed necessary by the building official, he shall make, or cause to be made, an inspection of materials or assemblies at the point of manufacture or fabrication. A record shall be made of every such examination and inspection and of all violations of the construction codes. 
                  (3)  Inspection service. The building official may make, or cause to be made, the inspections required by subsection (h)(6) of this section. He may accept reports of inspectors of recognized inspection services provided that after investigation he is satisfied as to their qualifications and reliability. A certificate called for by any provision of the construction codes shall not be based on such reports unless the same are in writing and certified by a responsible officer of such service. 
                  (4)  Inspections prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy or completion. The building official shall inspect or cause to be inspected at various intervals all construction or work for which a permit is required, and a final inspection is made of every building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system upon completion, prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy or certificate of completion. 
                  (5)  Posting of permit and work hours. Work requiring a permit shall not commence until the permit holder or his/her agent posts the permit card in a conspicuous place on the premises. The permit shall be protected from the weather and located at a prominent location, parallel to and facing the street and visible from the right-of-way.

                      In 2002 a majority of the state's electorate, voting in a referendum called for the purpose of ratifying a Constitutional Amendment to the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia, now Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d), confirmed the existence in a community of real property that is maintained in a blighted condition increases the city budget by increasing the need for governmental services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services.

                  Sec. 19-2. - Benefits of rehabilitation of blighted property. 
                      Rehabilitation of blighted improved property decreases the need for such governmental services and allows local governments to better utilize limited revenues available from ad valorem taxation of real property.

                  Sec. 19-3. - Existence of blighted property. 
                      The mayor and board of aldermen have determined the existence of properties within the city that are maintained in blighted condition and have enacted various ordinances intended to combat the existence of slum and blight and prevent its spread to properties in other areas of the city, including the designation of redevelopment areas, pursuant to Chapter 61 of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, however, the cost of current and previous efforts has outpaced the ability of the city to fund blight redevelopment from current revenue sources.

                  Sec. 19-4. - Program established. 
                      The mayor and board hereby establishes a community redevelopment tax incentive program, in accordance with the authority found at Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia, as follows.

                  ARTICLE II. - PURPOSE 

                  Sec. 19-20. - Increased costs due to existence of blighted property. 
                      The existence of real property that is maintained in a blighted condition increases the costs to city budgets by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services.

                  (1)  Provided the bond amount has been paid within 120 days after judgment and the delay has not prevented prosecution of the principal, and upon application to the court with prior notice to the prosecuting attorney of such application, said court shall direct remission of 95 percent of the bond amount remitted to the surety, if the surety located the principal in the custody of the sheriff in the jurisdiction where the bond was made, apprehends, surrenders, or produces the principal, if the apprehension or surrender of the principal was substantially procured or caused by the surety, or if the location of the principal caused the adjudication of the principal in the jurisdiction where the bond was made.

                  (3)  If, within 120 days after judgment, the surety surrenders title principal to the sheriff or responsible law enforcement officer, or said surrender has been denied by the sheriff or responsible law enforcement officer, surety locates the principal in custody of another jurisdiction, the surety shall only be required to pay costs and five percent of the face amount of the bond, which amount includes all surcharges. If it is shown to the satisfaction of the court, by presentation of competent evidence from the sheriff or the holding institution, that said surrender has been made or denied or that the principal is in custody in another jurisdiction or that said surrender has been made and that five percent of the face amount of the bond and all costs have been tendered to the sheriff, the court shall direct that the judgment be marked satisfied and the writ of execution, fieri facias, be cancelled.

                  Editor's note— Renumbered from Art. VII by Ord. No. 2015-13, § 2, adopted Oct. 1, 2015. 

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 22-151. - Findings. 
                  (a)  The number of flea markets in the city has increased in recent years, the operation of which has become unduly distracting to motorists and has created traffic hazards and other problems in connection with their operation. 
                  (b)  The general appearance of the city, and specifically areas surrounding flea market locations, is marred when operations are unsightly, inappropriate and poorly maintained, and when, in some instances, unsafe structures, sheds and sales areas exist, and debris and refuse accumulate. Failure to properly construct and maintain improvements upon the premises further detracts from the general appearance of the area and presents safety hazards. 
                  (c)  The aesthetic quality and economic values of both commercial and residential areas surrounding flea markets, as well as the economy of the city, are adversely affected by the unregulated operation of flea markets. 
                  (d)  Lives and property are endangered by traffic created by flea markets that have been unregulated and uncontrolled, and by vehicles for which no provisions for parking and safe ingress and egress have been made by flea market operators. 
                  (e)  Flea markets create difficulty in police supervision because of the lack of any controls over the number, identification and types of vendors and merchandise sold, and may become targets for the sale of, or dealing in, stolen merchandise. 
                  (f)  Most flea markets fail to provide even minimum facilities for the protection of the health or comfort of persons on the premises, such as plumbing, electrical and bathroom facilities. 
                  (g)  The public health, safety and welfare, and property values, in the city are detrimentally and adversely affected by the unregulated operation of flea markets. 
                  (h)  Unless steps are taken to ensure more satisfactory present and future operation of flea markets, the present appalling situation will become worse and more extensive through an increase in the number of flea markets, or further deterioration in flea markets already existing within the city. 
                  (i)  In most instances presently existing, flea market operations are incompatible with surrounding land uses. 
                  (j)  Many problems have been experienced within flea markets, particularly, but not limited to: 
                  (1)  Temporary sheds or structures not intended to be permanent, which are constructed in an unsafe and unsightly manner; 
                  (2)  Electrical, plumbing and other construction not complying with minimum codes, or which are built or improved without permits or inspections; 
                  (3)  Failure to provide adequate parking; 
                  (4)  Ingress and egress creating traffic hazards; 
                  (5)  Lack of bathrooms, plumbing or sanitary facilities; 
                  (6)  Failure to comply with commercial design standards; 
                  (7)  Failure of vendors to obtain business licenses or to maintain records; 
                  (8)  Failure to provide for minimum fire safety; 
                  (9)  Failure to protect against wind uplift; 
                  (10)  Difficulty of police supervision; and 
                  (11)  Deterioration of surrounding property values. 
                  (k)  There is a necessity for the adoption of an ordinance to regulate the location and operation of flea markets within the city in order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of its citizens and the general public.

                  Sec. 22-321. - Findings; public purpose; legal authority. 
                  (a)  Based upon the experience of other municipalities and counties, which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems potentially faced by the City of Acworth, Georgia, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the indiscriminate dispensing of massive amounts of powerful prescription drugs by unconventional pain clinics, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and board of the city that the indiscriminate dispensing of massive amounts of powerful controlled substances by unconventional pain clinics begets criminal behavior, tends to create an undesirable community and constitutes a danger to the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. Among the undesirable community conditions identified are drug addiction, drug overdoses, drug abuse, the illicit use of pharmaceutical drugs and other associated illegal activities. The mayor and board of aldermen finds that such conditions increase expenditure for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increase the burden on the judicial system as a consequence hereof and lead to a potentially dangerous condition for the citizens of the city. Therefore, this article is established to license certain entities and the same is created in the interest of public welfare and as a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the negative impact on the Acworth community as set forth herein. 
                  (b)  This article is adopted pursuant to Article 13 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  (c)  This article is further adopted to protect the public safety, health and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
                  (d)  This article is further adopted pursuant to the police power of the city. 
                  (e)  This article is further adopted pursuant to the Charter of the City of Acworth.

                  (a)  In any case the city manager, or his/her designee, may inspect the books of the business or profession for which the returns are made and such books or records for the business of which the return was made in the city, shall be submitted for inspection by the office of the business license and revenue division of the city within three days. Failure of submission of such books or records within 30 days shall be grounds for revocation of the tax certificate currently existing to do business in the city.

If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of the under reporting, interest will be assessed for the period delinquent.

Thereafter, a hearing shall be scheduled before the mayor and board of aldermen for the city within 45 days after the date of the notice of appeal by the applicant. After hearing by the mayor and board of aldermen, the board of aldermen may take such action as it deems appropriate, including the upholding of the action of the city manager or the imposition of such action as the mayor and board of aldermen may deem appropriate under the facts.

                  (c)  Transfer of ownership. The transfer of ownership of a business license or occupation tax certificate shall be considered in the same manner as the termination of the business and the establishment of a new business.

Ownership of such business license or tax certificate shall remain unchanged until the application of such purchaser or transferee is approved by the city and all proper fees and taxes are paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a corporation, a new license or tax certificate shall not be required as herein provided unless a change in stock ownership in the corporation results in ownership of more than 50 percent of the outstanding corporate stock, voting or otherwise, by persons or combinations of persons not owners of such stock at the time the license or tax certificate was issued. 
                  (d)  Death of license holder. In case of the death of any natural person holding a city business license or occupation tax certificate, or any interest therein, the license or certificate may be transferred to the administrator, executor of the lawful heir or devisee of the deceased person by filing a new application with the city for the change of ownership within 30 days of such death. The business involved may continue to operate until disposition of the application is determined as for an original license or certificate. No additional fees or occupation taxes shall be charged above what would be due if the business, or portion thereof, remained under the deceased person's ownership. 
                  (e)  Distance requirements. The change of ownership of a business shall not affect the distance requirements previously approved by the city.

                  (e)  Any business required to obtain health permits, bonds, certificates of qualification, certificates of competency or any other regulatory matter shall first, before the issuance of a city business registration, show evidence of such qualification.

                  (4)  An applicant (or licensee) has been convicted of any drug-related, alcohol-related or sex-related crime by the state or the city regarding an offense which was committed on the premises or which would otherwise violate the provisions of this chapter; 
                  (5)  An applicant fails to pay any fee, occupation tax, fine or other amount of money due to the city under this chapter or any other taxing ordinance of the city; and 
                  (6)  An applicant or the owner alters or allows to be altered, the business license occupation tax certificate (license document) or the applicant or the owner changes the information, defaces, destroys, misuses, abuses, or improperly alters or misrepresents the business license or occupation tax certificate. 
                  (c)  After said hearing, the city manager or his/her designee shall provide a written decision within 60 days to the applicant or licensee as to the proposed denial, suspension, or revocation of the applicant, certificate, or license.

                  (f)  In the event that the city manager or his/her designee shall deny an application for any occupational tax certificate or license hereunder, the applicant may not reapply for any such certificate or license, whether for the original business or any other business, for a period of 12 months following the denial. 
                  (g)  An applicant or any interested person with legal standing may appeal an administrative action or decision of the city manager, including any decision regarding the amount of taxes assessed and classification of a business.

                      In addition to the other remedies provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, city manager or his/her designee of the city, upon any tax or installment of said tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of said tax against the person, partnership, or corporation liable for said tax, which said execution shall bear interest at the rate of 1½ percent, per month, from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property in the city of the person, partnership or corporation liable for said tax all as provided by the ordinances and Charter of said city and the laws of the state.

If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution is issued pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him or her as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of taxes.

                  ARTICLE II. - WETLAND PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 42-31. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and population control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                      Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                      The state department of natural resources and the state department of community affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a wetlands protection ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder. 
                      It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                      (b) Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of the City of Acworth, Georgia. The purposes of this article are to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities which may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined by a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations, which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife areas and to comply with the requirements of state law related to wetland protection.

                  Sec. 42-33. - Wetland protection district established. 
                  (a)  Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as devised herein and located within the incorporated region jurisdiction of the City of Acworth, Georgia. The generalized wetland map (NWI), adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection district and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the city clerk and zoning department. 
                  (b)  Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (Ord. No. 2002-04, § 3, 1-17-2002) 
                  Sec. 42-34. - Local development permits. 
                  (a)  Local development permit requirements. 
                  (1)  No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the city department of public works in the form of a land disturbance activity permit (LDA). Issuance of a LDA is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. Prior to the issuance of a LDA, building permit, or a demolition permit the zoning administrator shall assess whether the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands and, if so, shall also assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area. To assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, the zoning administrator shall consult the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map for Cobb County. 
                  (2)  If the zoning administrator determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could not result in a disturbance of wetlands or if the proposed activity is not located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, the zoning administrator shall follow normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit. 
                  (3)  If the zoning administrator determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands and that the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional wetland determination shall be required prior to issuance of a building permit or a demolition permit. 
                  a.  If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that a Department of the Army permit is required, a building permit or a demolition permit shall be issued only following issuance of the Department of the Army permit. 
                  b.  If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that the proposed activity would not require a Department of the Army permit, the zoning administrator shall proceed with normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit. 
                  (b)  Permissible uses (use as a right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, drainage, or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  (1)  Operations conducted during normal silvicultural activities, including minor dredge and fill associated with road construction, harvesting, and reforestation practices provided they meet the performance standards and road construction best management practices required under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (2)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (3)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  (4)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission. 
                  (5)  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (6)  The pasturing of livestock provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved best management practices are followed. 
                  (7)  Education, scientific research, and nature trails. 
                  (8)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the city or its designee for the following reasons: 
                  a.  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures, or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and that, prior to the commencement of work, written notice has been given to the city or its designee and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns, and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland, are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  b.  Temporary water level stabilization measure with silvicultural operations, provided that they are necessary to alleviate abnormally wet or dry conditions that would have an adverse impact on the conduct of silvicultural activities if not corrected. 
                  c.  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating, or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration, or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of section 42-34(b). 
                  d.  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses, or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  (c)  Conceptual site plans. Applications for rezoning, annexation or general concept plan review shall include a site plan drawn at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet (the city may approve a different scale where necessary to clearly provide the required information), with the following information: 
                  (1)  Identification of all state waters and wetlands on the plan. 
                  (2)  Identification of proposed building(s) and impervious surfaces and distance to wetlands and state waters. 
                  (d)  Site plans. Applications for a LDA within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet (the city may approve a different scale where necessary to clearly provide the required information), with the following information: 
                  (1)  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale, vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings. 
                  (2)  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 200 feet. 
                  (3)  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream of water body. 
                  (4)  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet. 
                  (5)  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. 
                  (6)  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 
                  (e)  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. The site plan may be amended only with the approval of the city or its designee. The city may require a bond up to the larger of $5,000.00 or $1,000.00 per acre of project area and with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions and limitations set forth in the permit. The particular amount and conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of this article. In the event of a breach of condition of any such bond, the city or its designee may collect such bond or institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgement and execution. 
                  (f)  Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the city or its designee. Filing fees up to the larger of $500.00 or $100.00 per acre may be required to evaluate the application. This fee may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services pertaining to functional assessment and mitigation measures as deemed necessary by the city or its designee. In any case, the filing fees shall not be less than the amount necessary for evaluation of the application in a manner consistent with the intent of this article. 
                  (g)  Enforcement authority. The city zoning administrator is hereby established as the administrator of this article. The zoning administrator shall coordinate with the public works department and the city's engineer in reviewing all site plan applications.

                      "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                      "Substantial improvement" means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a 10-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
                  (1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or 
                  (2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
                      "Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision" is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                      "Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                      "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 50-79. - Variance procedures. 
                      The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this article. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the public works department, or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above. 
                  (1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the public works department. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the public works department. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  (2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the public works department shall have the right to appeal such decision to the city council as established by the city in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  (3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Cobb County, Georgia, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (7)  In reviewing such requests, the public works department and city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (8)  Conditions for variances: 
                  a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
                  3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  b.  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  d.  The public works department shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the public works department and city council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request. 
                  (10)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the public works department and the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article. 
                  (11)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

                  (a)  No development shall be allowed within the future-conditions floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
                  (1)  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
                  (2)  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
                  (3)  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or, 
                  (4)  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
                  (b)  Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under (1) above shall also meet the following conditions: 
                  (1)  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
                  (2)  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
                  (3)  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased;

                      Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below. 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and, 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the public works department until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the public works department.

                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the city's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and, 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
                  (b)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to this article. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
                  (1)  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
                  (2)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
                  (3)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the city to be a hotspot land use; or, 
                  (4)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items a and b above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  The following activities are exempt from this article, unless otherwise determined by the city: 
                  (1)  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project;

                  Sec. 50-114. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
                      The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
                  (1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and, 
                  c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (2)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  b.  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the 1-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (3)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the 1-year, 24-hour storm under paragraph (2) above is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the 2-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  (4)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  (5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 50-114. The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements, which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (7)  Drainage system guidelines.

               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 51-1. - Background. 
                      The risk to the municipality, its employees and customers from data loss and identity theft is of significant concern to the municipality and can be reduced only through the combined efforts of every employee and contractor. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-17, § 1, 6-19-08) 
                  Sec. 51-2. - Purpose. 
                      The municipality adopts this sensitive information policy to help protect employees, customers, contractors and the municipality from damages related to the loss or misuse of sensitive information. 
                      This policy will: 
                  (1)  Define sensitive information; 
                  (2)  Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on paper; 
                  (3)  Describe the electronic security of data when stored and distributed; and 
                  (4)  Place the municipality in compliance with state and federal law regarding identity theft protection. 
                      This policy enables the municipality to protect existing customers, reducing risk from identity fraud, and minimize potential damage to the municipality from fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the municipality: 
                  (1)  Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within new or existing covered accounts; 
                  (2)  Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts; 
                  (3)  Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and 
                  (4)  Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-17, § 2, 6-19-08)

                  (1)  Internally, sensitive information may be transmitted using approved municipal e-mail. All sensitive information must be encrypted when stored in an electronic format. 
                  (2)  Any sensitive information sent externally must be encrypted and password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a statement such as this should be included in the e-mail: 
                  "This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary information and is intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally addressed. Any use by others is strictly prohibited." 
                  (Res. No. 2008-17, § 4, 6-19-08) 
                  Sec. 51-5. - Additional identity theft prevention program. 
                      If the municipality maintains certain covered accounts pursuant to federal legislation, the municipality may include the additional program details. 
                  (1)  Covered accounts. A covered account includes any account that involves or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. Every new and existing customer account that meets the following criteria is covered by this program:

                  b.  Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the municipality from identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or litigation risks. 
                  (2)  Red flags. The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud. Any time a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent, it should be investigated for verification. 
                  a.  Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting agency; 
                  b.  A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report; 
                  c.  A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in response to a request for a consumer report; or 
                  d.  A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency as defined in § 334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions Act. 
                  e.  Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a pattern of activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as: 
                  1.  A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries; 
                  2.  An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;

                  b.  The photograph or physical description on the identification is not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the identification. 
                  c.  Other information on the identification is not consistent with information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer presenting the identification. 
                  d.  Other information on the identification is not consistent with readily accessible information that is on file with the municipality, such as a signature card or a recent check. 
                  e.  An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled. 
                  (4)  Suspicious personal identifying information. 
                  a.  Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when compared against external information sources used by the municipality. For example: 
                  1.  The address does not match any address in the consumer report; 
                  2.  The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File; or

                  d.  The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons opening an account or other customers. 
                  e.  The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of other customers or other persons opening accounts. 
                  f.  The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in response to notification that the application is incomplete. 
                  g.  Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the municipality. 
                  h.  When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name, etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report. 
                  i.  Unusual use of, or suspicious activity related to, the covered account. 
                  (5)  Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the municipality receives a request for new, additional, or replacement goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account. 
                  a.  A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments 
                  b.  A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example: 
                  1.  Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments; 
                  2.  A material change in purchasing or usage patterns. 
                  c.  A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors). 
                  d.  Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the customer's covered account. 
                  e.  The municipality is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements. 
                  f.  The municipality is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in connection with a customer's covered account. 
                  g.  The municipality receives notice from customers, victims of identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the municipality 
                  h.  The municipality is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-17, § 5, 6-19-08) 
                  Sec. 51-6. - Responding to red flags. 
                  (a)  Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the municipality from damages and loss. 
                  (1)  Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this information to the designated authority for determination. 
                  (2)  The designated authority will complete additional authentication to determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic. 
                  (b)  If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions must be taken immediately. Actions may include: 
                  (1)  Canceling the transaction; 
                  (2)  Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement; 
                  (3)  Determining the extent of liability of the municipality; and 
                  (4)  Notifying the actual customer that fraud has been attempted.

                  Sec. 51-7. - Periodic updates to plan. 
                  (a)  At periodic intervals established in the program, or as required, the program will be re-evaluated to determine whether all aspects of the program are up to date and applicable in the current business environment. 
                  (b)  Periodic reviews will include an assessment of which accounts are covered by the program. 
                  (c)  As part of the review, red flags may be revised, replaced or eliminated. Defining new red flags may also be appropriate. 
                  (d)  Actions to take in the event that fraudulent activity is discovered may also require revision to reduce damage to the municipality and its customers. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-17, § 7, 6-19-08) 
                  Sec. 51-8. - Program administration. 
                  (a)  Involvement of management. 
                  (1)  The identity theft prevention program shall not be operated as an extension to existing fraud prevention programs, and its importance warrants the highest level of attention. 
                  (2)  The identity theft prevention program is the responsibility of the governing body. Approval of the initial plan must be appropriately documented and maintained. 
                  (3)  Operational responsibility of the program is delegated to city treasurer and city clerk, jointly. 
                  (b)  Staff training. 
                  (1)  Staff training shall be conducted for all employees, officials and contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may come into contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that may constitute a risk to the municipality or its customers. 
                  (2)  Each department head is responsible for ensuring identity theft training for all requisite employees and contractors. 
                  (3)  Employees must receive annual training in all elements of this policy. 
                  (4)  To ensure maximum effectiveness, employees may continue to receive additional training as changes to the program are made. 
                  (c)  Oversight of service provider arrangements. 
                  (1)  It is the responsibility of the municipality to ensure that the activities of all service providers are conducted in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. 
                  (2)  A service provider that maintains its own identity theft prevention program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and validated by appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these requirements. 
                  (3)  Any specific requirements should be specifically addressed in the appropriate contract arrangements.

                  Sec. 62-60. - Employment eligibility verification policy. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The City of Acworth is committed to complying with federal laws and regulations concerning verification of employment eligibility and record keeping for employees hired to work in the United States. To this end, certain staff members have been designated to assist the city in such compliance. Anyone with questions regarding any aspect of employment and/or identity verification should contact human resources. 
                  (b)  Scope. All newly-hired regular and temporary/seasonal, part-time, and full-time employees are subject to the I-9 employment verification process if they are physically performing work for the City of Acworth. 
                  (c)  Policy. In accordance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 ("IRCA"), the city is required to verify the identity and establish that workers are eligible to accept employment in the United States. The IRCA stipulates that the employment verification process be completed in person and that verification be completed within three working days of the beginning of employment and backdating of forms is prohibited. 
                  (1)  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) have established an electronic system called E-Verify to assist employers further in verifying the employment eligibility of all newly-hired employees. 
                  (2)  The failure to complete the I-9 employment verification process within the time limits prescribed is a violation and may subject the city to civil and/or criminal liability.

                  (a)  Upon acceptance of an offer of employment or within three working days of the first day of employment, human resources must complete and/or receive a completed I-9 form to have employment eligibility verified. 
                  (b)  The documents used by the employee to substantiate employment eligibility must be inspected for authenticity, and only an authorized trained representative must sign the I-9 form. 
                  (c)  All departments are prohibited from employing individuals who have not successfully completed the I-9 employment verification process within three working days of date of hire from employing any undocumented worker. This includes independent contractors, staffing agencies, and recruitment firms that use undocumented workers. 
                  (d)  If the employee is unable to present acceptable document(s) or resolve a "no match" letter if received from the Social Security Administration within the third business day after employment, the employee will be given an additional seven business days to resolve any issues. During this time the employees' employment will not be affected and the employee will be afforded the opportunity to resolve any discrepancy in order for the city to verify employment eligibility. However, continued failure of the employee to submit the required I-9 documentation or to resolve any discrepancy may result in immediate termination until the issue is resolved. 
                  (e)  The human resources department will contact any active employees whose I-9 documentation has expired. The human resources department will be responsible for following-up on non-compliance with personnel liaisons and directly with employees as needed. 
                  (f)  Upon request, human resources may delegate responsibility for verification of employment eligibility; such departments shall typically have a high level of seasonal hiring activity. 
                  (g)  Individuals with such authority must receive training on form I-9 reporting requirements and identification of falsified identification. The human resources department will provide such training and maintain a list of employees authorized to approve I-9 forms. 
                  (h)  I-9 forms and copies of the acceptable documents that were reviewed by the departments must be sent to the human resources department. The human resources department will review the I-9 forms for completeness and process in the E-Verify system. 
                  (i)  All records regarding verification of employment eligibility will be maintained by the human resources department. 
                  (j)  In the first quarter of each year an audit will be conducted of previous calendar year documents related to the verification of employment eligibility. In compliance with Image Best Employment Practices, trained employees not otherwise involved in the I-9 process will conduct the audit process approved by the internal audit manager and the results reported to the city manager.

                  (a)  As a general policy, in order not to lose competent applicants, the city personnel department will accept applications at any time, whether or not a vacancy has been announced. As a result of a single application, a candidate shall be considered for all classes of positions in which his principal qualifications might be profitably used. 
                  (b)  Each applicant for a position within the city government shall make application on a standard application form approved by the city manager. 
                  (c)  The personnel officer may reject an application that indicates that the applicant is deficient in any of the requirements specified in the class specification or recruitment notice. An applicant may also be rejected for the practice, or attempted practice, of fraud or deception in the completion of his application, or if his past record of employment is determined to be unsatisfactory by the personnel officer.

                  Sec. 62-143. - Qualifications; evaluations. 
                      City employees shall meet the employment standards established by the position classification plan and such other reasonable minimum standards as to character, aptitude, ability to meet the public and physical condition as may be established by the personnel officer with the advice and recommendations of the department heads, provided, such minimum standards are necessary for satisfactory job performance and do not discriminate against any race, sex, nationality or religion. Discrimination in the employment of any person who is an applicant for a merit system position because of race, creed, color, sex, political affiliation or national origin shall be prohibited. The personnel officer shall review all applications to determine whether the applicant meets the qualifications established for the position. Oral interviews may be conducted by the personnel officer and/or department head. With the approval of the department head and the personnel officer, fingerprinting, check of arrest records, physical examination or other background checks may be required if deemed a factor in job performance.

                  (a)  Any person, other than employees with an employment contract, appointed to a full-time permanent position shall serve a probationary period of one year. Employees serving a probationary period following initial employment in a permanent position shall receive all of the benefits provided in accordance with this chapter, with the following exceptions, or as otherwise provided: 
                  (1)  A full-time employee may accumulate vacation leave, but shall not be permitted to take vacation leave until such employee has been employed for a period of six months, unless the denial of such leave shall create an unusual hardship. Vacation leave may be granted to such employee only with the approval of the department head. 
                  (2)  An employee, if dismissed during the probationary period, shall not be eligible for terminal pay for accumulated vacation leave, nor shall he be entitled to exercise the right to appeal his dismissal. 
                  (b)  Employees who receive a promotion shall serve a one-year probationary period following such promotion, and during such probationary period, such employee shall continue to receive all benefits provided in accordance with this chapter and under supplementary rules and regulations, including the right of appeal; however, during such probationary period, such employee may be reinstated to his former position without cause and without any right of appeal. 
                  (c)  Before the end of the probationary period, the department head shall indicate in writing to the personnel officer:

                  (2)  Whether the employee is performing satisfactory work; 
                  (3)  Whether the employee should be retained in the position;

                  Sec. 62-147. - Separations. 
                      An employee may be separated from city government service by any of the following methods: 
                  (1)  Notice of resignation, reemployment. To resign in good standing, an employee shall give his department head at least 14 calendar days' prior written notice. Failure to comply with such requirement shall be entered on the employee's personnel records and may be grounds for refusal of reemployment. Any employee who resigns shall not be eligible for reemployment with the city unless the city manager determines that exceptional circumstances exist to warrant reemployment. In accordance with section 62-225(d), any employee who resigns without giving at least 14 days' prior written notice shall not be entitled to receive payment for any accrued annual leave. 
                  (2)  Compulsory resignation. An employee who, without valid reason, fails to report to work for three consecutive days without authorized leave shall be separated from the payroll and his absence shall be reported as a compulsory resignation. Such an employee may not be eligible for reemployment with the city. 
                  (3)  Layoffs. The term "layoff" means the termination of employment of an employee when, for any valid reason, it may be necessary to abolish one or more positions, or reduce the number of employees in the city service. Layoff does not reflect discredit upon the service of the employee. Prior to the layoff, the department head shall consider work records, employee evaluation ratings and length of service, and shall make recommendations to the city manager and the board of aldermen as to which employees shall be laid off. The chief basis of the layoff decision shall be the relative competence of the employees for the job that remains. In choosing between two employees, the employee most competent for the job that remains shall be retained. If it is found that two or more persons in the organizational unit in which a layoff is to be made have equal ratings as determined by review of employee records and evaluation ratings, the last employee to enter the service shall be the first to be laid off. No permanent career employee shall be laid off while another person in a classified position is employed on a temporary basis in the same class if the employee is willing to accept the temporary or part-time work. Permanent career employees shall be notified in writing at least 14 calendar days prior to the effective date of such layoff, and shall be informed of their right of appeal such layoff under section 62-183. 
                  (4)  Loss of job requirement. Any employee who is unable to adequately perform his job because of loss of a necessary license or other requirement shall be separated by a layoff or placed in another position for which he may be qualified at the discretion of the department head and city manager. 
                  (5)  Dismissal. An employee in a classified service may be terminated from city employment for cause. 
                  (6)  Death. When a permanent employee dies while in the classified service, his estate shall be eligible to receive the accumulated annual leave and any other compensation due the deceased employee. 
                  (7)  Retirement. The provisions of the retirement ordinance shall apply.

                  Sec. 62-148. - Credit of sick leave and retirement. 
                      A city employee who has been separated from city government service because of a reduction in the work force, or who has resigned while in good standing, shall be credited with his previously accrued sick leave if he is reinstated within one year. If the reinstated employee shall have continued to be a member of either the employee's retirement system or the peace officer's benefit and retirement fund, he shall receive full credit for all accrued contributions up to the time of his separation.

                  Sec. 62-149. - Reinstatement of seniority. 
                      Except as provided in section 62-148, when a city employee, upon proper notice to terminate his employment, is rehired within 12 months of his resignation, after 24 continuous months of employment, such employee shall have his seniority reinstated.

                  Sec. 62-150. - Limitation of employment of relatives. 
                  (a)  A department head, or any person serving in a supervisory capacity, is prohibited from hiring an immediate family member, or a member of such supervisor's immediate household, into a position within their line of authority. Such department head or supervisor is further prohibited from hiring an immediate family member of any person currently serving as mayor or city alderman. The term "immediate family member" means spouse, son, daughter, parent, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law and any other person living in the same household. 
                  (b)  Immediate family members of employees of the city shall not be employed if such employment will result in one immediate family member supervising another immediate family member, or where one immediate family member occupies a position that has an influence over the other immediate family member's employment, promotion, salary administration and other related management or personnel. Specific work site or duty considerations may warrant transfer of city employees who subsequently become related by marriage. If a transfer is not possible, then the city manager may terminate the employee with the least seniority, or the parties may agree on which employee shall leave city employment. Application of this provision will be limited to those circumstances where the employer's interests outweigh the adverse impact, if any, upon the affected employees. 
                  (c)  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, any person who is a relative of the mayor, member of the board of aldermen or the city manager, who is an employee of the city at the time such mayor, member of the board of aldermen or city manager is elected or appointed to office, may continue in his employment with the city.

                  Sec. 62-151. - Examination by health care provider. 
                      The city may direct any city employee to be examined by a health care provider of the city's choosing, including, but not limited to, a specific psychologist, physician or psychiatrist.

                  Sec. 62-152. - Disability. 
                  (a)  If it is determined by the city, with information received from a health care provider, that an employee cannot perform the essential functions of his job due to a disability, and the employee goes on disability, the employee shall be considered to be on an unpaid leave of absence. Such leave of absence shall run concurrently with the leave requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). FMLA shall begin immediately upon an employee going on disability leave. 
                  (b)  The city will continue to pay all health insurance premiums and contributions to retirement for a disabled employee as it does for all employees for a period of six months from the date the employee goes on disability, and shall be considered shortterm disability. 
                  (c)  If, after a period of six months from the date that an employee goes on disability, an employee suffers from a disability which prevents him from performing the essential functions of his position, even with reasonable accommodation, the city manager shall then have the option of: 
                  (1)  Terminating the employee's employment for inability to perform the job, and the employee shall then be entitled to all benefits as outlined in the city's longterm disability insurance policy. 
                  (2)  Holding the employee's position for a period of up to an additional three months past the original six months of shortterm disability if the employee can show medical proof that there is a likelihood that the employee will be able to return to work within the additional three-month period. (Note: The city manager shall specify a specific time when the employee shall return to work which shall not exceed three additional months past the original six-month period. The time specified shall be based on the medical documentation indicating when the employee would be able to return to work. The city shall have the right to have the employee examined by its own doctor to determine if there is a likelihood of the employee returning to work.) The employee shall be required to pay 100 percent of all insurance premium costs, and no contribution shall be made to the retirement system for the employee during such period. If the employee does not return to work within the time approved by the city manager past the original six-month period of shortterm disability, then the employee shall be terminated for inability to perform his job. The employee shall be entitled to all benefits as outlined in the city's longterm disability insurance policy. 
                  (d)  An employee on shortterm disability shall continue to accrue sick time, vacation time and seniority for a period of 30 days. The employee shall not lose his vacation and/or sick time, but he shall not accrue any additional time until he comes back to work full-time. After one month on disability, an employee's seniority shall be frozen. 
                  (e)  An employee shall cooperate with the city's disability carrier to determine the limitations imposed by such employee's medical condition, and shall cooperate to design, if appropriate, reasonable accommodation for the essential functions of his job.

                  Sec. 62-153. - Family and medical leave. 
                  (a)  City of Acworth will comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA") in accordance with the applicable statutes regulations, and Department of Labor Guidelines ("FMLA Statutes"). 
                  This FMLA policy is intended to explain the FMLA statutes, and any terms herein used that are defined in the FMLA statutes carry the same definitions as in the FMLA statutes. This policy neither adds to nor subtracts from the rights and obligations under the FMLA statutes. 
                  (1)  Eligibility. Provided that the city employs at least 50 employees within 75 miles of the requesting employee's worksite, all full-time and part-time employees who have been employed by the city for one year (not including any period of employment preceding any break in service of at least seven years) and who have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding a request for leave, are eligible for FMLA leave for the following reasons: 
                  (i)  The birth of the employee's child and to care for the newborn child; 
                  (ii)  The placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care; 
                  (iii)  The care for the employee's spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition; 
                  (iv)  The care of the employee's own serious health condition; 
                  (v)  The care of a covered servicemember who is a spouse, child (any age), parent, or next of kin; and 
                  (vi)  Attention to matters arising from an exigency of deployment of a spouse, child or parent in the National Guard or Armed Forces Reserves. 
                  Covered servicemember means any current member of the US Armed Forces, including National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may render the individual medically unfit to perform the duties of the individual's office, grade, rank, or rating. 
                  Next of kin means the nearest blood relative, not including spouse, parent, son, or daughter, in the following order of priority: A) Blood relatives granted legal custody of the covered servicemember, B) brothers and sisters, C) grandparents, D) aunts and uncles, E) and first cousins, unless the covered servicemember has specifically designated in writing another blood relative for purposes of this leave, which relative shall be deemed the only blood relative for this purpose. Documentation may be required to establish the qualifying relationship. 
                  Exigency of deployment. An exigency of deployment is a call to active duty in support of a contingency operation pursuant to: 10 USC §§ 688, 12301(a), 12302, 12304, 12305, or 12406 or 10 USC Chapter 15 or any other provision of law during a war or during a national emergency declared by the President or Congress, and only in connection with a federal call to duty, unless a state call to duty is pursuant to one of the foregoing provisions or order of the President, and regardless of whether the call to duty is initiated by a state or the federal government, provided that one of the following exists: 
                  a.  Short notice deployment. Leave for up to seven days may be taken if the servicemember receives seven or fewer days notice of the deployment. 
                  b.  Military events and related activities. Leave may be granted to attend official military ceremony or program or to attend family support or assistance programs and informational meetings sponsored or promoted by the military, military service organizations, or the American Red Cross, provided that all of the foregoing relate to the call to active duty. 
                  c.  Childcare and school activities. Leave to arrange, in connection with the child (including stepchildren and adopted or foster children who are under the age of 18 or are age 18 or older and are incapable of self-care) of the servicemember, for alternative or changed childcare or schooling, to provide urgent or immediate care (as opposed to routine or regular care), or to attend meetings with school or childcare staff when the need to make such arrangements or provide such care arises from the call to active duty. 
                  d.  Financial and legal arrangements. Leave to make or update financial arrangements in connection with the servicemember's absence or, during active duty status and for a period of 90 days following the termination of the servicemembers' active duty status, to act as the servicemembers representative in connection with obtaining, arranging, or appealing military service benefits. 
                  e.  Counseling. To attend counseling by someone other than a healthcare provider for the employee, the covered servicemember, or the child of the servicemember in connection with the call to active duty. 
                  f.  Rest and recuperation. Leave for up to five days in connection with each instance in which the servicemember is on short term leave for rest and recuperation. 
                  g.  Post-deployment activities. Leave to attend arrival ceremonies, reintegration meetings and events, and any other official ceremony or program sponsored by the military within 90 days of termination of the servicemember's active duty status or to address issues arising from the servicemember's death. 
                  h.  Additional activities. Leave to address other events which arise out of the call to active duty, provided that the city and the employee agree that such leave qualifies as an exigency and agree on the timing and length of the leave. 
                  (2)  Required Use of Paid Leave. Employees will be required to apply all paid and unpaid leave (including annual leave time, compensatory time, etc.) concurrent with FMLA leave. Employees receiving pay for the use of paid leave will be required to comply with all of the requirements of City of Acworth paid leave policies. An employee's accrued sick leave, workers' compensation and/or disability leave will not be applied towards FMLA leave if the employee is taking FMLA leave for any purpose other than that allowed under those policies and provided further that an employee will not be required to take paid leave concurrent with FMLA leave if the employee is receiving income benefits under a City of Acworth group disability plan or under workers' compensation law. 
                  (3)  Serious health condition. A serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that results in an incapacity (i.e., the individual is unable to care for themselves or unable to perform the essential functions of the job or, if a child, unable to attend school). A serious health condition must also involve one of the following: 
                  a.  Hospital care. At least one night's stay in a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility, including any period of incapacity or subsequent treatment in connection with or consequent to the inpatient care. 
                  b.  Absence plus treatment. A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days (including any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition), that also involves either (1) treatment two or more times within 30 days of the onset of the incapacity, provided that the first in-person visit with the healthcare provider occurs within seven days of the onset of incapacity, by, or under the supervision of or pursuant to referral by a health care provider, or (2) treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion, provided that the first in-person visit with the healthcare provider occurs within seven days of the onset of incapacity, which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of a health care provider. a regimen of continuing treatment does not include the taking of over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, antihistamines, or salves, or bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a health care provider. 
                  c.  Pregnancy. Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care. 
                  d.  Chronic condition requiring treatment. A chronic condition which (1) requires periodic visits (at least twice a year) for treatment by, or under the direct supervision of, a health care provider, (2) continues over an extended period of time (including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition), and (3) may cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity (examples: asthma, diabetes, epilepsy). 
                  e.  Permanent/long-term conditions requiring supervision. A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. The individual must be under the continuing supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment by, a health care provider (examples: Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease). 
                  f.  Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments (including any necessary recovery period) by a health care provider or by a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis (physical therapy), and kidney disease (dialysis). 
                  (b)  Notice required of employee. When use of FMLA leave is foreseeable, an employee must provide 30 days advance notice to the City. If the employee becomes aware of the need for leave less than 30 days in advance, notice must be provided as soon as practicable. If an employee fails to provide 30 days advance notice, and it is determined that use of FMLA leave was reasonably foreseeable, then FMLA leave may be denied until 30 days have elapsed from the date notice was given or should have been given. If additional FMLA leave is needed for qualifying reason previously approved, the employee should specifically refer to that reason or specifically request FMLA leave. 
                  When scheduling medical treatment, the employee should consult with the immediate supervisor and department head regarding the schedule so as to minimize undue disruption caused by the employee's absence(s). 
                  If a leave request in connection with an exigency of deployment is not accompanied by a copy of the military orders or other acceptable military documentation, such documentation will be requested in connection with the first request for leave for each deployment. 
                  (c)  Medical certification. If an employee is taking FMLA leave, the leave request should be accompanied by a medical certification of the need for leave on a form approved by the city. If the leave request does not include a medical certification, the city will request, in writing, that the employee provide medical certification to the city on or before the later of (1) fifteen (15) calendar days after the written request from the city for the certification, or (2) the commencement of the leave. Failure to submit the certification may result in denial of FMLA leave or delay of the leave until the certification is submitted. Additional medical opinions may be obtained by the city at its option and will be binding in accordance with the FMLA statutes. 
                  The city requires that the employee provide subsequent medical certifications on the approved form. Generally, the re-certifications will be required no more often than every 30 days. However, recertification may be required more or less frequently in accordance with the FMLA Statutes. 
                  (d)  Medical benefits. The city will continue all health care benefits for the duration of FMLA leave, provided the employee pays the employee's portion of the health care benefit premiums. 
                  Any employee on FMLA leave will be required to continue to pay health care benefit premiums during the time the employee is on FMLA leave, by submitting to the city at the beginning of each month an amount equal to the monthly premiums that would have been deducted from the employee's pay were the employee not on FMLA leave. The city may cancel all health care benefits if the employee's premium payment is more than 30 days late if the city has provided 15 days' written notice to the employee prior to cancellation. The city will continue health benefits during these 30 days. 
                  If an employee fails to return to work after the employee's FMLA leave entitlement has been exhausted or expires, the city will be entitled under certain circumstances to recover the health care benefit premiums paid by the city during the period of unpaid FMLA leave. An employee must return to work for a minimum of thirty days in order to qualify as "returning to work." 
                  (e)  (1)  12-month period. Eligible employees are entitled to take up to twelve weeks of FMLA leave during a rolling 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. An employee's entitlement to leave for a birth or placement for adoption or foster care expires at the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of the birth or placement. Spouses who are both employed by the city are limited to a combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period if the leave is taken for the birth of the employee's child or the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care. 
                  (2)  An eligible employee is entitled to 26 weeks of covered servicemember leave on a per covered servicemember per injury/ illness basis, provided that no more than 26 weeks of FMLA leave for any reason (although no more than 12 weeks may be taken for a qualifying reason other than servicemember leave) may be taken during a single 12-month period as measured from the start of each such period of covered servicemember leave. If both spouses intend to care for a covered servicemember and are both employed by the city, they are limited to a combined total of 26 weeks of leave if the leave is in connection with covered servicemember leave and is limited as set forth in (e)(1), above. 
                  (f)  Reinstatement. On return from FMLA leave, the employee is entitled to be returned to the same position the employee held when leave commenced, or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits pay, and other terms and conditions of employment, provided the employee is able to perform the essential functions of the position. An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during the leave period. 
                  (g)  Return to work certification. An employee with a serious health condition who has been out on FMLA leave must provide certification that the employee is fit to return to work. The employee will be provided with a list of the essential functions of his/her job with the city response to a request for FMLA leave. For certain positions, an employee on intermittent leave may be required to submit a fitness-for-duty certification every 30 days due to safety concerns. The employer may delay restoration until the certification is provided. 
                  (h)  Intermittent and reduced schedule leave. FMLA leave for the serious medical condition of the employee or a family member, for an exigency of deployment, or covered servicemember, may be taken in increments or result in a reduced schedule of work, provided (except in the case of an exigency of deployment) the need for intermittent reduced-schedule leave is certified by the health care provider on the approved medical certification form. If an employee needs leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule for planned medical treatment, then the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the employer's operations. In addition, if an employee takes intermittent or reduced-schedule leave, the city has the right to assign the employee to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits if the alternative position better accommodates the need for such leave. Regardless of the manner in which any paid leave is taken by an employee pursuant to city policies, leave may not be deducted from an employee's "bank" of FMLA leave in increments of time that are greater than one hour. 
                  (i)  Termination of employment. Unless otherwise required by law, employment with the city will normally terminate if the employee does not return to work after the maximum amount of FMLA leave has been taken. 
                  (j)  Key employees. At the time FMLA leave is requested, the city will designate an employee as a "key employee" if that employee is among the highest paid ten percent of city employees at the time the FMLA leave is requested. 
                  (1)  The key employee will be given a written notice at the time FMLA leave is requested, or as soon as practicable thereafter, that the employee qualifies as a key employee. In addition to informing the employee that he/she qualifies as a key employee, the city will also inform the employee of the potential consequences with respect to reinstatement and maintenance of health benefits. 
                  (2)  When the city makes a determination that substantial and grievous economic injury to its operations will result if a key employee who has requested or is using FMLA leave is reinstated, the city will notify the employee as soon as practicable in writing of its determination, stating that it intends to deny restoration to employment on completion of the FMLA leave (notice of intent). This notice of intent will explain the basis for the city's determination and will provide the employee a reasonable time in which to return to work, taking into account the circumstances, such as the length of the leave and the urgency of the need for the employee to return. 
                  (3)  If an employee does not return to work in response to the notice of intent, the employee will continue to be entitled to maintenance of health benefits during the remainder of the FMLA leave, provided that the requirements of subsection(c), above, are met, and the city will not recover its cost of health premiums. 
                  (4)  After the notice of intent is given to the employee, the employee will remain entitled to request reinstatement at the end of the leave period. The city will then again determine whether there will be substantial and grievous economic injury from reinstatement, based on the facts at that time. 
                  (5)  Any written notices given to a key employee must be either sent by certified mail or given in person.

                  (2)  Oral or written reprimands. 
                  (3)  Shift changes.

                  (4)  Employees shall not use the grievance procedure to complain about a proper order, directive, regulation, policy or administrative decision issued by a supervisor or management official who is acting within their delegated authority.

                  a.  Step 1. Upon receiving a grievance from an employee submitting a grievance for the first time, the supervisor must discuss the grievance informally with the employee within five working days of the submission of such grievance. The employee will be given a decision in writing within five working days after such discussion. 
                  b.  Step 2. If the employee is not satisfied with the decision in step 1, or the supervisor fails to comply with the time limits established in step 1, the employee may continue the grievance by submitting the grievance to his supervisor's immediate superior, if any, in the administrative service. Such grievance shall be submitted within three days of the supervisor's decision or the expiration of the time period listed in step 1. The next level supervisor shall discuss the grievance with the employee and other appropriate persons within five working days after the grievance is filed with the supervisor. The supervisor shall render his decision and comments in writing, and return such decision and comments to the employee within five workdays after meeting with the employee. If the employee does not agree with the decision reached, or the supervisor fails to provide resolution of the grievance, the employee may continue following the appeal procedure and time lines up to the city manager. 
                  c.  Step 3. The city manager, upon receiving the grievance, shall discuss the grievance with the employee and other appropriate persons within ten workdays of receipt of the grievance. The city manager shall render his decision and comments in writing, and return such decision and comments to the employee within five workdays after meeting with the employee. The decisions of the city manager shall be final. The city manager may extend the time for discussing the grievance with the employee and/or rendering a decision on the grievance within his discretion. 
                  Note: The appeals procedure outlined in section 62-183 shall be used for cases involving demotion, suspension, dismissal, layoff in violation of established policy or charges of discrimination in promotion procedures.

                  (c)  An employee who is directed to undergo such physical or psychological testing shall execute such authorizations as may be necessary for the city to receive any records and reports relating to such testing from the physician or psychologist performing the test and to further authorize such physician or psychologist to discuss the employee's physical or psychological condition with the employee's department head and city manager. The employee shall also receive a copy of any reports or records which the city receives from such physician or psychologist. Any employee who is directed to undergo such physical or psychological testing and refuses to do so shall be guilty of insubordination and shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

All unused vacation hours in excess of what is allowed to be accrued shall be forfeited. 
                  (f)  Time for using vacation leave. Vacation leave assignments will be made in accordance with the preference of the employee, where possible; however, vacation leave must be taken at the convenience of the department, and the department head's decision as to when leave may or may not be taken will be final. Seniority will be a major factor when preparing leave schedules. 
                  (g)  Transfer to another employee. Upon a showing of exceptional circumstances, as determined and approved by the department head, an employee may transfer accrued annual leave to another employee.

Exceptional circumstances shall include, but are not limited to, unusual or extended illness of another employee or such other employee's family. 
                  (h)  Resignation of employment. Employees who resign their employment with the city shall not be paid for accrued vacation leave upon their resignation unless such employee has given the city 14-days' prior written notice of such resignation. 
                  (Ord. No. 2000-26, 8-3-2000; Ord. No. 2011-13, § 1, 6-2-2011; Ord. No. 2013-19, § I, 5-16-2013; Ord. No. 2013-33, § I, 10-3-2013)

                  (a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribe to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. 
                      Sick leave means paid leave that may be granted to each eligible employee who, through sickness or injury, becomes incapacitated to a degree that makes it impossible for the employee to perform the duties of their position; is quarantined by a physician because they have been exposed to a contagious disease; or is absent for medical, dental or optical examination or treatment. An eligible employee may use sick time to care for their immediate family (custodial children, spouse, the employee's parents). Up to three days sick leave may be used for emergency personal leave if specifically approved by the appropriate department head. 
                  (b)  Entitlement. All permanent employees, working full-time or part-time, and career employees serving temporarily in substitute or acting capacities, shall be eligible to accrue sick leave as set forth in subsection (d) of this section. Temporary/seasonal and other part-time or substitute employees shall not be eligible for sick leave. 
                  (c)  On-the-job injury. 
                  (1)  An employee who sustains an injury on the job must, at the time of the injury or as soon as possible after such injury, notify their supervisor on the forms provided by the city. An employee injured on the job is entitled to weekly income benefits under the City of Acworth's workers' compensation if they have more than seven days of lost time due to an injury. If the employee is out of work more than 21 consecutive days, workers' compensation will pay them for the first week. 
                  (2)  The city allows an employee to use sick leave for the first week that they would not be receiving any benefits under workers' compensation. However, if the employee is out more than 21 consecutive days workers' compensation will then pay them for the first week they were absent. 
                  (3)  There are two options on how an employee can handle the first week of absence: 
                  a.  If the employee uses sick leave to cover the first week and they are out more than 21 consecutive days they can reimburse the city by signing the workers' compensation check over to the city and have their sick leave credited back. 
                  b.  If they choose to cash the workers' compensation check and not reimburse the city they will lose the sick leave taken to cover the first week. 
                  (d)  Accrual. Full-time eligible employees shall accrue sick leave at the rate of four hours per bi-weekly pay period, or major portion thereof, for a total of 104 sick leave hours per year. Permanent employees working less than full-time shall earn two hours per bi-weekly, or major portion thereof, for a total of 52 sick leave hours per year. If unused, sick leave may be carried over each year and added to previously accumulated sick leave, up to a maximum of 248 hours. Sick leave time shall accrue from the date of employment. A full time employee who has taken 64 hours or more sick leave with or without pay in one bi-weekly pay period shall not earn sick leave credit for that period. A permanent employee working part time who has taken 32 hours or more sick leave with or without pay in one bi-weekly pay period shall not earn sick leave credit for that period. 
                  (e)  Reporting. An employee who is absent from work because of illness is responsible for reporting such absence to the appropriate supervisor or department head as soon as the employee is aware that they will not be coming in due to sickness and at a minimum within two hours after the designated reporting time on the day of absence, and such employee shall be expected to keep his supervisor or department head informed of his progress on a regular basis, and such leave will be charged against the employee's sick leave. Employee shall provide supervisor or department head expect leave required during absence. Where a relief employee is required in a department that must provide 24-hour sustained service, the employee must report his absence two hours before the designated reporting time. 
                  (f)  Use; abuse. Sick leave shall not be considered a right an employee may use at their discretion, but a privilege not to be abused. Department heads who believe an employee is abusing the sick leave privilege may require the employee to furnish a doctor's certificate for each period of absence, regardless of the provisions set forth in subsection (g) of this section. 
                  (g)  Doctor's certificate. A department head may require an employee to present him with a written statement by a licensed physician or dentist, certifying that the employee's condition prevented him from performing the duties of their position if an employee is absent from work in excess of three consecutive working days or the employee has a pattern of absence due to sickness. If a department head requires a doctor's certificate, then sick leave with pay shall only be paid to the employee if the employee submits the doctor's certificate. 
                  (h)  Lack of sick leave. All employees are expected to use sick leave for its intended purpose and to accumulate sick leave so they have it when it is needed. If for some reason an employee has no accumulated sick leave but needs to be absent from work because they are sick, they must first use any vacation time they have is lieu of sick time. If the employee has no vacation time or sick time accumulated they shall be entitled to a maximum of three days off without pay, but shall provide a note from a doctor or dentist explaining the employee was under their care and the period of care (or date the employee could return to work). If the employee does not bring in the note the employee shall have been considered absent without leave and it shall be considered a voluntary quit. 
                  This provision shall only be allowed to be used by an employee once within a 12-month period. If the employee needs time off for being sick more than once in a 12-month period and the employee has no sick time or vacation time to use and the employee is absent from work then the employee shall have been considered absent without leave and it shall be considered a voluntary quit. 
                  (i)  Termination of employment. An employee, upon separation from the city government service, shall not receive payment for accumulated sick leave. 
                  (j)  Buy-back. Employees who have accumulated the maximum sick leave of 240 hours may, at their option, sell all sick leave that has accrued in excess of such 240 hour maximum during the calendar year to the city during the first week of December of such calendar year in exchange for an amount equal to half the employees hourly rate of pay (calculated hourly pay for salaried employees) for each hour of sick leave in excess of 240 hours. In addition, employees who have accumulated the maximum 240 hours of sick leave and who have not used any sick leave during the calendar year shall receive two full personal days of leave (equal to their scheduled workday) to be used at the employee's discretion during the following calendar year.

In order to receive full pay for the necessary time off duty, all fees received by the employee, other than meal and travel allowance, must be deposited with the fiscal officer. Employees who perform jury duty or are required to be a witness in a legal proceeding when such is required during periods when the employee is otherwise in a nonduty status will be permitted to retain all fees and allowances received.

An application for leave without pay shall be submitted in writing in advance, and shall state the employee's reason for requesting such leave, and shall contain a statement that such employee intends to return to the city government service upon expiration of such leave, and that he agrees to the terms and conditions as outlined in this section. In emergency situations, when an employee does not have accrued leave and is unable to return to work as scheduled as a result of illness or emergency reasons, their department head may recommend approval of the granting of leave without pay without prior application by the employee, or the personnel officer may investigate and make such recommendations in the absence of the department head. 
                  (d)  Temporarily filling of position. During an employee's approved leave of absence, their position may be filled by temporary appointment or substitution.

The city manager will review the request and decide whether or not the course fulfills the requirements of the policy and whether or not adequate funds are available. He or she will either approve or deny the request and sign it. At this point, the original request will be returned to the respective department head who will notify the employee of the decision. Another copy will be kept in the employee's personnel file. 
                  (11)  Registration. The employee may register for the course once the application is approved. The city is not responsible for any costs an employee may incur unless they have specific written approval from the city manager. 
                  (12)  Evidence of satisfactory completion. Upon the completion of the approve course(s), the employee is required to submit certified transcripts of his or her grade(s) and cancelled check(s) or receipts for the approved course(s) to the department head. These documents must be attached to the original "request for tuition reimbursement" document. These documents should be submitted within 30 days of completing the course(s) to the department head.

                  Sec. 62-342. - Drug testing. 
                  (a)  Findings. 
                  (1)  The city has a public trust to provide a variety of services to the city. An efficient and productive work force is vital to carry out such trust. The public has a reasonable right to expect persons employed by the city to perform their duties free from the effects of drugs, including alcohol. 
                  (2)  The city has an obligation to ensure public safety through the actions of its employees. Furthermore, employees of the city have a reasonable right to work in a safe environment, free from the effects of drug use. The city has a reasonable right to expect its employees to report for work fit for duty, free from the effects of drug use. 
                  (3)  The city recognizes that an employee's physical condition affects job performance, and that drug abuse ranks as one of the major health problems in society. It is the intent of this section to express the city's viewpoint on drug usage exhibited by behavioral and medical disorders, to encourage an enlightened viewpoint towards such disorders and to provide guidelines for consistent handling of situations arising from such disorders. 
                  (b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                      Controlled substance means any of those substances listed under O.C.G.A. as a controlled substance. The term "controlled substance" shall include marijuana and cocaine. 
                      Drug and alcohol testing means urinalysis or breath analysis. 
                      Illegal drugs mean drugs for which the possession, use, sale or distribution is unlawful pursuant to state or federal laws or regulation. The term "illegal drugs" shall include drugs that are not legally obtainable and drugs that are legally obtainable but have been obtained illegally. 
                      Intoxicating substance means any substance that produces changes in a person's physical, mental or emotional state or behavior, including, but not limited to glue, paint thinner, etc. 
                      Possession means having controlled substances that are not obtained either directly from a doctor or pharmacist using a valid prescription, or having controlled substances, the possession or use of which is unlawful pursuant to state or federal laws or regulations, including a person having such substances in his body. 
                      Reportable incident means any personal injury or property damage involving a city employee which occurs on or off city property during assigned work hours, or that occurs at a time an employee is using a city vehicle. 
                      Under the influence of alcohol means, as a result of the consumption of alcohol, an employee's or applicant's ability to perform his job is impaired to an appreciable degree. For the purposes of this definition, a blood alcohol level of 0.04 percent alcohol in the blood by weight shall conclusively establish that an employee is under the influence. However, an employee with a blood alcohol level of less than 0.04 percent alcohol in the blood by weight may also be considered to be under the influence of alcohol if job performance is impaired to any appreciable degree. 
                      Under the influence of drugs or other intoxicating substances means, as a result of the consumption, inhalation or injection of drugs or any other intoxicating substance, an employee's job performance is impaired to an appreciable degree, or if a drug screen is positive for any illegal drugs. 
                  (c)  Rules and regulations. 
                  (1)  The city is concerned with situations where use of alcohol and intoxicating substances are detrimental to the public trust or the safety of employees or citizens. The city is committed to the rehabilitation of employees who abused alcohol by allowing continued employment for those employees who are voluntarily enrolled in an alcohol rehabilitation program at such employee's expense. 
                  (2)  Early recognition and treatment of alcohol problems is important for successful rehabilitation to improve job performance and reduce personal, family and social disruption. Employees who participate in a program for the purpose of treating alcoholism may do so without jeopardizing their employment with the city, provided, they stop all involvement with alcohol and, provided, the employee enrolls and satisfactorily participates in an alcohol abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a federal, state or local health, law enforcement or other such governmental agency at the employee's own expense. Continued employment is also predicated on the employee not violating the conditions set forth in this section more than one time. 
                  (3)  To implement the policy set forth in this section, the following rules are established as conditions of employment with the city:

                  b.  Disciplinary action. 
                  1.  As a condition of employment by the city, all employees shall abide by the terms set forth in this section.

Such employee will be directed to undergo drug or alcohol detection tests. The employee shall be transported to a medical or police department facility for drug and alcohol testing. All testing will be at the city's expense. Employees who are tested pursuant to this subsection shall be furnished with a copy of the test results upon the request of the employee. The refusal by the employee to submit to such testing shall be cause for disciplinary action, including dismissal.

Whenever an individual applies for employment with the city, and in order to be considered for such employment, the applicant shall be required to undergo drug and alcohol testing. All drug and alcohol testing will be at the city's expense, and the applicant tested pursuant to this subsection shall be furnished with a copy of his test results upon the request of the employee. The refusal of an applicant to submit to such testing shall remove the applicant from being considered for employment by the city. The city will not hire any applicant who tests positive on a detection test for illegal drugs or alcohol. Such persons will be prohibited from employment with the city for a period of one year, unless they provide certified documentation of successful completion of a substance abuse rehabilitation program. Applicants who have completed a substance abuse rehabilitation program will be subject to drug screening prior to being employed. 
                  e.  Random testing. The city shall be authorized to conduct random drug testing of city employees who are classified in safety-sensitive positions. Such testing will be at the city's expense, and any employee tested pursuant to this subsection shall be furnished with a copy of his test results upon the request of such employee. The refusal by the employee to submit to such testing shall be cause for disciplinary action, including dismissal. The positions classified as safety-sensitive shall be as follows:

                  f.  Termination for positive test result. If any employee's alcohol test performed pursuant to this section is positive, the employee's employment with the city shall be terminated, or at the option of the city, the employee shall be required to satisfactorily participate in an alcohol abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a federal, state or local health, law enforcement or other governmental agency. An employee's participation in such alcohol abuse assistance rehabilitation program shall be at the employee's own expense, and shall be a condition of continued employment with the city. If any employee's drug test performed pursuant to this section is positive for illegal drugs, the employee's employment with the city shall be terminated with no right of appeal. 
                  g.  Inspection of premises. Whenever the city manager or his designee has reasonable cause to believe that there is alcohol, illegal drugs or any controlled substance, as defined by state law, present in or upon any real property owned or occupied by the city, or in any personal property owned or possessed by the city, the city manager or his designee shall have the right to inspect the premises, including an employee's desk, clothing, purse, personal belongings or person, in order to investigate potential misconduct relevant to the performance of an employee's duties, and to prevent damage in the future to the city's ability to discharge its duties and responsibilities.

                  (b)  Computer viruses on downloaded software: Any software obtained from outside the city government shall be virus checked prior to use. Any virus outbreaks or virus-like activity on the city network will be promptly reported to the IT director and/or his/her designee. 
                  (c)  Use by contractors: Contractors and other non-city employees may be granted access to city provided Internet services at the discretion of the city manager and IT director. Acceptable use by contractors and other non-city employees, contracted with the city, is the responsibility of the contracting department head. Department heads are expected to provide such individuals who use city Internet and/or e-mail services with this policy. 
                  (d)  Passwords: Use passwords associated with the city's information system only on that system. When setting up an account at a different information system that will be accessed using the Internet, choose a password that is different from ones used for city information systems. 
                  (e)  VPN (External Access): The city will provide some users access to the city network via virtual private network (VPN) access from home computers. Such access will be gained through a secured VPN appliance. When completing VPN access, users should always exit the VPN connection to help prevent potential breaches of security. 
                  (f)  Shared computers (logoff): Some computers are shared among several users. Each user is responsible for activities occurring on the computer while they are logged into their individual account.

                  (h)  Large file transfers and internet capacity: The Internet connection is a shared resource. While routine e-mail and file transfer activities won't impact other users much, large file transfers and intensive multimedia activities will impact the service levels of other users. 
                  (i)  Disclaimers: Users shall avoid being drawn into discussions where disclaimers like "this represents my personal opinion and not that of my department or of the city" need to be used. When you are using Internet and/or e-mail services provided by the city, users need to remember that they are representing the city and shall act accordingly. Users may be held legally responsible for any litigious acts against the city resulting from statements made on the Internet or by via e-mail. 
                  (j)  Retention: This policy shall comply in all respects with the Retention Schedules set forth by the State of Georgia Archives in accordance with O.C.G.A 50-18-99. Only essential files and e-mail should be saved. 
                  (k)  Permanence: Users shall exercise the same care in drafting e-mail that would be applied to any other written communication. E-mail is more permanent than paper communications and anything said in e-mail may be discovered by an opponent in litigation. All e-mail communications shall follow the retention schedule as listed above. 
                  (l)  Enforcement: All provisions of this policy are deemed rules of the city and violation of any could result in disciplinary action up to and including termination in accordance with the City of Acworth Personnel Ordinance/Manual.

Before Internet or outside e-mail services are granted, the employee must sign the attached release form signifying the employee's familiarity and acceptance of this policy statement. When an instance of non-compliance with this policy is discovered or suspected, the agency shall proceed in accordance with departmental and city personnel policies. Complaints about inappropriate or offensive e-mail should be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor. Such reports shall be taken seriously by the supervisor and carefully investigated. Suspension of service to users may occur when deemed necessary to maintain the operation and integrity of the city's network. User accounts and password access may be withdrawn without notice if a user violates the acceptable use policy. Disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment may be imposed depending on the severity of the violation. Criminal or civil action against users may be initiated when laws are violated.

                      Employees of the City of Acworth who maintain personal websites, social network sites, blog accounts, twitter accounts, and other similar sites should always be mindful that they represent the city.

                  --- (4) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2009-07, § 1, adopted April 2, 2009, set out provisions intended for use as art. I, §§ 62-15—62-19. For purposes of classification, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as art. XI, §§ 62-425—62-429. 

                  Sec. 62-425. - Policy. 
                  (a)  Sexual harassment is a form of employee misconduct which undermines the integrity of the work environment. Sexual harassment is also a form of sex discrimination in violation of various federal and state civil rights laws. 
                  (b)  It is the policy of the city to seek prevention of sexual harassment of its employees and applicants for employment. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-07, § 1, 4-2-2009) 
                  Sec. 62-426. - Rights and responsibilities. 
                      In order to preserve the rights of all employees to work in an environment free from sexual harassment and, also, to protect the legitimate privacy interests of innocent parties, the city will provide a method for the confidential resolution of sexual harassment complaints. All parties should, but are not required to exhaust the informal remedies described herein before they resort to the formal grievance procedure. 
                  (1)  Supervisory responsibilities. Supervisors are responsible for maintaining a positive work environment, setting a good example for others and promptly investigating all complaints of sexual harassment to determine what, if any, remedial action may be warranted. In resolving sexual harassment complaints, supervisors should seek advice and guidance from the personnel administrator and cooperate fully with his/her efforts to resolve any complaints referred to the personnel administrator by other parties. Supervisors should strive first and foremost to prevent any recurrence of prohibited activities or retaliation against victims. 
                  (2)  Aggrieved employee/applicant responsibilities. 
                  a.  An aggrieved party should try to tell the aggressor directly that his/her behavior is unwelcome, harmful or offensive to the aggrieved party. Some offenders may be genuinely oblivious to the effect of their words or conduct on other people and would be willing to change if only they knew they were hurting or offending someone. Aggrieved parties are strongly encouraged to promptly report the incident to the offender's supervisor or department head, or alternatively to personnel (human resources), so as to minimize the risk of repeated incidents or retaliation by the aggressor. Although, supervisors and managers of the city are to take appropriate action when they have reason to suspect that harassment has occurred, employees should not assume that the city is aware of any problem. It is also the employee's responsibility to bring any complaint to the attention of the management of the city so that the problem may be resolved. 
                  b.  Aggrieved parties should make reasonable, good faith efforts to resolve their complaints before they resort to the formal grievance process. However, failure to do so does not preclude resorting to the formal grievance procedure and/or disciplinary action or any other resolution by the appropriate manager as a result of such grievance. 
                  (3)  Personnel administrator responsibilities. 
                  a.  The personnel administrator shall facilitate the resolution of any complaints brought to his/her attention. Upon request, the personnel administrator will provide counseling and support to victims, supervisors and other involved parties. The personnel administrator shall serve as expert advisor to any supervisor who is part of the reviewing procedure in the formal grievance process. In this capacity, the administrator shall offer his/her best professional judgment as to whether certain allegations, if true, would constitute sexual harassment. 
                  b.  The personnel administrator is responsible for providing training to city supervisors and managers on the subject of sexual harassment. The training should provide supervisors with current information on applicable laws, rules, regulations and procedures and provide techniques for the careful investigation and mediation of sexual harassment allegations.

                      [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
                      Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature where: 
                  (1)  Submission to said conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual's employment; or 
                  (2)  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment or continued employment; or 
                  (3)  Such conduct has the purpose or necessary effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating a hostile, intimidating or offensive work environment; or 
                  (4)  Such conduct or behavior was known by the aggressor to be unwelcome, harmful or offensive; or 
                  (5)  A person of average sensibilities would clearly have understood that the behavior or conduct was unwelcome, harmful or offensive. 
                      Work environment is defined as any place where the business of the city is conducted in the name of the city or any department or division thereof.

                  Sec. 62-428. - Resolution procedure. 
                  (a)  Any employee or applicant for employment who, in good faith, believes that he may be a victim of sexual harassment should: 
                  (1)  Immediately ask the alleged offender to stop doing the unwelcome, harmful or offensive conduct; and 
                  (2)  Promptly contact the offending party's supervisor, department head or personnel administrator for support and guidance. Successful resolution efforts will be greatly facilitated by the timely reporting of complaints. 
                  (b)  The supervisor of the alleged offender and department head will promptly investigate the complaint and if the complaint is founded, will take appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 
                  (c)  The aggrieved party may also file a formal grievance as outlined in art. V, section 62-184 of the personnel ordinance. Time limits for filing a formal grievance of sexual harassment are extended to 30 calendar days from the date of a specific alleged occurrence. If the alleged issue relates to on-going conditions, the employee may file a written grievance at any time. 
                  (d)  The personnel administrator will advise all supervisors and the city manager regarding the substance of the formal charges. 
                  (e)  If a complaint is filed against the personnel administrator, the city manager or his/her designee shall fulfill the role ascribed to the personnel administrator.

                  Sec. 62-429. - Remedial action. 
                  (a)  In determining what remedial action may be appropriate, supervisors should consider the extent to which the offender knew or reasonably should have known that his/her conduct was unwelcome, harmful or offensive. Any person who: 
                  (1)  Commits sexual harassment; or 
                  (2)  Shirks his/her investigatory or supervisory responsibilities; or 
                  (3)  Provides false witness against another; 
                  shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action including, but not limited to, referral to professional counseling at the offending party's expense; oral and written reprimands, performance probation, suspension or termination. 
                  (b)  Some coercive behavior, such as threats or promises that employment reprisals or awards will follow the refusal or granting of sexual favors, constitutes gross misconduct and may provide just cause of immediate termination.

In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purposes of this article. An undue hardship shall be a situation not of the person's making, and shall consist of a problem unique to a specific property, or result in, if the terms of this article are complied with, noncompliance with one or more other ordinances of the city.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 74-1. - Purpose and findings. 
                      We, the mayor and board of aldermen of the City of Acworth, find that the following regulations are necessary to our fundamental goals of protecting the health, safety and welfare of residents, visitors and businesses in the City of Acworth. 
                      A sign is by nature designed to draw attention. This characteristic makes signs a valuable medium of communication. However, this same characteristic distracts motorists and pedestrians and can degrade the aesthetic character of a place. Thus signs must be regulated to insure that they contribute to rather than detract from the visage of the community. Proper regulation is necessary to limit the negative impact of signs while encouraging the positive and constructive uses of signs. The city has an interest in regulating signage for public safety and aesthetic purposes. By limiting the number and size of signs within the city, this chapter directly operates to reduce visual clutter for the motoring public. 
                      This chapter regulates signs by establishing signage districts. These districts are determined by geography: the confluence of topography, flora, economy, and society. Size, height, materials, number, location on a lot, methods of construction, maintenance, and illumination are dictated by this chapter. It is believed that such controls will improve the general appearance of the City of Acworth; protect the lives and health of residents and visitors; protect public investments; have a positive impact upon the economy of the city; and enhance the attractiveness of Acworth as a place to live, recreate, and do business. 
                      Signs are a valuable means of commercial advertising and noncommercial speech. This chapter is intended to reasonably regulate signs in the City of Acworth while showing full deference to the right to engage in constitutionally protected speech. It shall hereafter be unlawful for any person to erect, place, or maintain a sign in the city except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

Architectural and landscape features can effectively serve similar purposes, often to much greater aesthetic ends. 
                  (g)  Gateway district. 
                  (1)  The total square footage of signage shall be determined according to the number of linear feet of business street frontage in a freestanding structure on a single lot, or linear feet of business frontage for a multi-tenant structure at the rate of one square foot of sign for one linear foot of frontage. In cases where a multi-tenant structure has two primary entrances, a front and a rear, that are architecturally similar in façade and are both fully accessible by the public, the maximum allowable sign area shall be calculated at a rate of one and one-half square foot of sign for one linear foot of business frontage. Only one, the primary, frontage may be utilized in this calculation and the total area shall be allocated into signage for both entrances. This area may not be utilized towards a single frontage; a sign must be placed on both frontages. Signs may be monument, wall-mounted, sandwich board, awning, or hanging. Monument signs shall be less than ten feet in height, measured from the level of the crown of the adjacent road to the highest point on the sign structure and set at least ten feet from all property lines. Each lot shall have no more than one monument sign. In no event shall wall signs exceed more than 30 percent of the wall area on which they are displayed. Hanging and awning signs shall be a minimum of eight feet above the grade of the public right-of-way as measured from the bottom of the sign structure to the pavement directly below and shall have no point higher than the highest point of the building façade. Signs shall adhere to the prevailing design scheme of the structure to which they are affixed, and shall be constructed of wood, masonry, or metal. Signs may be lighted internally or indirectly. A-frame signs shall be located no further than ten feet from either the front door of the establishment displaying the sign or from an attached patio area utilized by the establishment displaying the sign; shall not impede pedestrian or vehicular traffic in any way; and shall be posted only during the posted operating hours of the establishment displaying the sign. Only one A-frame sign may be utilized per business/per property, may not exceed 24 inches in width by 36 inches in height, may not have any additional signage or other external features added to the sign or its structure,and may not be attached to sawhorses, easels, or other means of propping up signage. 
                  (2)  For parcels over ten acres, the zoning administrator shall have the discretion to allow up to two double-faced monument signs per street frontage if the development has two curb cuts and the signs are at least 400 feet apart. In this case, the height of the signs shall not exceed 15 feet and overall square footage for both signs shall not exceed 1,000 square feet. 
                  (3)  As defined in this chapter, planned developments shall be allowed one double-faced monument sign no larger than 250 square feet per side and a maximum height of 30 feet measured from the level of the crown of the adjacent road to the highest point on the sign structure. Space on this sign may be subdivided among tenants and/or outparcels in the shopping center as the developer sees fit. Each sign must be set at least 20 feet from any property line. However, commercial developers are encouraged to find other means than signage to identify their properties. Special architectural and landscape features can effectively serve similar purposes. 
                  (4)  Outparcels of planned developments shall abide by the general standards of the Gateway district, except ground signs shall not exceed eight feet in height. 
                  (h)  Residential district. 
                  (1)  In the residential district, one sign shall be permitted for each unit. Signs may be wall-mounted or hanging. Signs shall not exceed four square feet in area. Wall signs shall not exceed more than 25 percent of the wall area on which they are displayed. Hanging and awning signs shall be a minimum of eight feet above the grade of the public right-of-way as measured from the bottom of the sign structure to the pavement below and shall have no point higher than the highest point of the building façade. Signs shall adhere to the prevailing design scheme of the structure to which they are affixed, and shall be constructed of wood, masonry, or metal. Signs may be lighted indirectly only. 
                  (2)  In addition, one double-faced monument sign no larger than 100 square feet per side, or two single-faced monuments no larger than 50 square feet, and a maximum height of six feet may be placed at the major entrances of all residential developments (single- and multi-family) measured from the level of the crown of the adjacent road to the highest point on the sign structure and set at least ten feet from all property lines. However, subdivision developers are encouraged to find means other than signage to identify residential areas. Special architectural and landscape features can effectively serve similar purposes. In cases of a non-residential use within the residential sign district, the monument shall have a maximum height of eight feet as measured from the level of the crown of the adjacent road to the highest point on the sign structure. 
                  (i)  Interstate 75—High rise sign overlay. The Interstate 75 high rise sign overlay is intended to address visibility of Acworth businesses located within 500 feet of the interchange of Highway 92 at Interstate 75 and at Cherokee Street (Glade Road) and Interstate 75. Lake Acworth Drive and Baker Road were also used as natural boundaries to delineate the overlay district proposed (see sign district map for exact parcels contained within the overlay district). The city recognizes that visibility is a factor necessary for businesses to thrive. In an effort to encourage redevelopment opportunities, the city sets forth the following regulations that would provide high-rise signage opportunities to promote such businesses. This overlay addresses only high-rise signs, if requested, and does not take precedence over a parcel's existing sign district regulating wall sign, monument sign or other signage requirements. 
                  (1)  Only one high-rise sign shall be permitted per parcel/business. If the sign is proposed at a master planned development containing more than one user, only one high-rise sign shall be permitted for the entire development. 
                  (2)  A parcel requesting a high rise sign shall be a minimum of one acre in size and zoned C-2 (community retail commercial). 
                  (3)  The new high rise sign shall be located no closer than 250 feet to the nearest residentially zoned property, as measured from the outermost perimeter of the sign. 
                  (4)  The new high rise sign shall be erected no closer than 20 feet from any property line. 
                  (5)  The maximum height allowable shall be 100 feet with a maximum face area of 300 square feet. The face area of the high rise sign shall not count against the overall allowable signage area permitted by the parcel's existing sign district. 
                  (6)  Signs may be used to advertise businesses that are located on the property (no off premises commercial advertising), or may be used to display protected non-commercial messages. 
                  (7)  Signs shall be internally lit only. 
                  (8)  No flashing or animated signs, messages or components are to be allowed.

                  Sec. 74-44. - Billboards. 
                      In order to promote a better aesthetic character in the City of Acworth, billboards shall be allowed in the Highway 41 corridor district and the Highway 92 district.

                  (14)  A LED billboard shall: 
                  a.  Contain static messages only, and shall not have movement nor flashing on any part of the sign structure, design, or pictorial segment of the sign, nor shall such sign have varying light intensity during the display of any single message. 
                  b.  Electronic changeable message signs may not operate at brightness levels of more than 0.20 foot candles above ambient light levels as measured at the following distances:

                  h.  The owner of said LED billboard sign shall provide to the city contact information for a person who is available to be contacted at any time and who is able to turn off the electronic sign promptly after a malfunction occurs. If, at any time more than five percent of the LED display lights malfunction or are no longer working, the owner of said LED billboard shall make repairs to the sign within 60 days or the sign will require removal. 
                  i.  If the city finds that the LED billboard sign causes a glare or otherwise impairs the vision of the driver of a motor vehicle, the owner of the sign, within 24 hours of a request by the city, shall reduce the intensity of the sign to a level acceptable to the city. 
                  j.  Each sign must comply with all Georgia Department of Transportation rules and regulations applicable to electronic changeable message signs where not in conflict with this chapter.

                  (6)  The developer must ask for a final inspection and bond release of the subdivision when development is substantially complete (approximately 90 percent). At that time the city will hold an inspection and if to the satisfaction of the public works director, the performance bond will be released. However, as for subsection (5) above, a maintenance bond must be submitted and approved prior to release of said performance bond. 
                  (Ord. No. 2004-34, 8-19-2004; Ord. No. 2017-02, 2-16-2017) 
                  Sec. 76-6. - Construction practices. 
                  (a)  Any person conducting land disturbance activities in the city shall follow all requirements contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
                  (1)  Best management practices, as set forth in this chapter, shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the city or to any other allegation of noncompliance with this chapter or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by the City of Acworth or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes, which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the City of Acworth or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The city may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (b)  Any person conducting land disturbance activities in the city shall practice best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices, to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, or deemed necessary by the city, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Disturbed soils shall not be allowed to leave the site or enter undisturbed buffer areas. 
                  (8)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (9)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (10)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. Allowing sediment to leave the site constitutes a violation of city ordinance. 
                  (11)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (12)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (13)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (14)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (15)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in this chapter; 
                  (16)  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. Hand clearing of vegetation is preferred to minimize damage to existing vegetation. 
                  (17)  There is established a 50-foot buffer with an additional 25-foot impervious setback along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the city determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the EPD's Department of Natural Resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 50 feet, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the EPD's Department of Natural Resources as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: Stream crossings for water lines; or Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  b.  Administrative variance may be applied for proposed encroachment into the 25-foot impervious setback with the following restrictions: 
                  (i)  The total area of encroachment may not exceed 30 percent of the total required impervious setback area; 
                  (ii)  The depth of the encroachment may not exceed the first 15 feet of the 25-foot impervious surface setback; 
                  (iii)  A statement of hardship and the reason for the proposed encroachment; 
                  (iv)  A statement of the quality and existing condition of the stream (water quality, stream channel stability, bank stability, etc.) and vegetative buffers (stability, density of vegetation, and types of vegetation). Discuss parameters for adjacent properties upstream and downstream of the project site, in addition to the on-site portion of the stream and show a clear depiction of the proposed encroachment; 
                  (v)  A narrative of the best management practices (BMPs) for erosion and sedimentation control that will be installed and maintained during construction; 
                  (vi)  A conceptual stormwater management plan and/or preliminary hydrology study that describes, but is not limited to, detention ponds, pre- and post-construction calculations, number of discharge points into buffer, and water quality BMPs; 
                  (vii)  For encroachments exceeding 20 percent of the total required impervious setback area, the applicant shall incorporate additional filtration systems to proposed/existing detention ponds. This shall include, but is not limited to, oil separator systems or first flush systems; 
                  (viii)  A narrative of the post-developed condition, including all types of water quality improvements and other mitigation that will be incorporated into the project. 
                  (18)  There is an established 50-foot buffer with an additional 25-foot impervious setback as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 50-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The EPD may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  (ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (19)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent the City of Acworth from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions, which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements of this chapter. The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (c)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2004-34, 8-19-2004; Ord. No. 2007-16, § 1, 7-19-2007; Ord. No. 2017-02, 2-16-2017) 
                  Sec. 76-7. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The public works director, personally or through his designated representative and employees will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the city shall regulate both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, permit conditions, the provisions of this chapter, and/or failed to take all necessary measures to prevent erosion, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the violations and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
                  (c)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.

                  Sec. 76-8. - Penalties. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbance activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. 
                  (b)  Stop work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first violation of the provisions of this chapter, the city shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have two days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within two days, the city shall issue a stop work order requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the city shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a second and each subsequent violation, the city shall issue an immediate stop work order; and; 
                  (3)  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect for 24 hours or until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred, which ever of the two is of a greater time frame. 
                  (4)  When a violation is in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the city, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the city. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. 
                  (1)  If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan or take all necessary measures to ensure compliance, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the violations at hand and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond. The city may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. Should the amount of correcting the deficiencies, noncompliance or violations, exceed the amount of the bond, then the subdivider shall pay any and all costs beyond bond coverage. 
                  (2)  If a period of 18 months elapses from the commencement of the maintenance period for any development and defects, noncompliance or violations still exist to the extent that the development has not been accepted by the city, the city is authorized to withhold the issuance of any and all permits or to refuse inspections to any subdivider or person on the project in dispute or any other project in which the developer may have a financial interest or, both, who violates or fails to comply with any city ordinance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this chapter or who negligently or intentionally fails or refused to comply with any final or emergency order of the city issued as provided in this chapter shall be liable for civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, notwithstanding any provision in any city Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Sec. 82-73. - Conditions. 
                  (a)  The permit issued pursuant to this division shall also specify that the permittee shall at all times be responsible to the public and hold the city harmless for any property damage or personal injury caused or occasioned by the installation, maintenance or occupancy of any wire, cable or conduit under, upon or above a street right-of-way as permitted in this article. 
                  Failure to comply with the terms and conditions set forth in this article may result in revocation of the installation and any right-of-way encroachment permit(s) and require the removal of such facilities from the rights-of-way. 
                  (1)  The 2009 Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards Manual. The 2009 Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards Manual, including all references contained therein to codes, rules, regulations, schedules, forms and appendix items, promulgated by the State of Georgia Department of Transportation, as may be amended from time to time is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated in the article as if fully set forth herein, subject to the amendments and modification contained in this chapter. A copy of the manual is available on line. Any conflicts between the provisions of this article and the manual shall be resolved in favor of the manual. References to State personnel, agencies, and fees shall be interpreted, where required, as meaning the City of Acworth municipal equivalents 
                  (2)  Protection of traffic and roadway. In conformance with city policy, no utility may occupy the city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the P/W and or power department(s) from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities and further provided that maintenance and operations of such facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right of way, or the right of way itself. 
                  (3)  Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon at least ten business days' notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so; protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation. 
                  (4)  Installation of poles and other wireholding structures and their relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the Utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities shall be so located, installed, approved (or denied) by the Director of Public Works/Acworth Power to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners and or other utilities. Specifically, the utility must comply with the city height standard of a maximum of 48 feet (ground to top of pole) in residential areas throughout the city and no such pole (utility or otherwise) shall be a stand-alone or other type of mono pole. The cost of any utility pole(s) that must be modified or changed to accommodate the requested Utility, such cost will be borne by the utility. Existing Power apparatus to accommodate any Utility will not be relocated to accommodate such utility. If the 48-foot standard cannot be met insomuch that the maximum height would be exceeded due to the utilities requested install, then such costs to place the utility underground shall be borne by the utility. Additionally, no receiver, repeater or antenna type apparatus shall be place on any pole within the city. See Exhibits "A" for pole attachment criteria configuration(s) of lines and placement data per NESC, ECG, etc. 
                  (5)  Indemnification.

                  (6)  Consequential damages. As a condition precedent for obtaining a right-of way-encroachment permit, the utility shall indemnify and hold harmless the city and its officers, employees, or agents against any and all claims or litigation arising from any construction activities within the public right-of-way, including but not limited to vehicular damage caused by such disruption to the right-of-way.

                  (b)  Facilities of a utility who fails to comply with the above provision shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prosecuting the violator; and/or any other remedy provided by city ordinance or otherwise at law or in equity.

                      Recurring local service revenues mean:

                  Sec. 86-5. - Levied; rate. 
                      An annual ad valorem tax upon all real and personal property within the city is hereby levied. The millage rate therefore shall be established each year by resolution of the mayor and board of aldermen. 
                  (Ord. No. 2013-30, § 1, 10-17-2013) 
                  Sec. 86-6. - Taxation by city; certain past due collections by county authorized. 
                      The city shall collect ad valorem taxes by notices of the amount due to all residents and property owners of the city. The city also authorizes the tax commissioner of Cobb County to collect past due ad valorem taxes for tax years prior to fiscal year 2010. 
                  (1)  Administration. 
                  a.  Except as otherwise provided, the city treasurer or his or her designee shall be charged with the duty to administer the imposition, collection and enforcement of all taxes and special assessments levied or imposed by the city in accordance with the administrative procedures hereinafter set forth. To the extent this Code section fails to provide a designated procedure, said officer shall act in the manner established, if any, for county tax collectors under applicable state law. 
                  b.  In determining the fair market value of property within its taxing jurisdiction, the city shall use the fair market value as finally determined for the property for county ad valorem tax purposes as required by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-352. 
                  c.  Following adoption of its current fiscal year budget, the mayor and board of aldermen shall, by ordinance, adopt a millage rate upon which property subject to ad valorem tax will be billed. Prior to adoption of said millage rate, the governing body shall publish the notice of proposed ad valorem tax rate as required by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-32, as may be amended from time to time. Millage rates shall be calculated using 40 percent of the assessed fair market value of the property upon which the tax is levied. 
                  d.  The city treasurer shall issue a bill to be sent to all taxpayers at the address last shown on the county tax digest by regular U.S. mail, with adequate postage thereon; provided, however, failure by the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for nonpayment or late payment of the tax. The bill shall state the location or description of the property taxed, the fair market value of the property (100 percent and its taxable value, 40 percent of fair market value), and the amount of tax due thereon. The bill shall also state the due date after which taxes shall be in default. The bill may also contain such additional information as allowed by law or authorized by the mayor and board of aldermen. 
                  (2)  Due date; payment; interest on past due taxes. 
                  a.  All ad valorem taxes shall be due and payable in full within 60 days after notice, unless the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which case it shall be postponed until the first day following which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. All payments must be postmarked no later than the due date. Supplemental ad valorem taxes and special assessments shall be due and payable on the date set forth in the ordinance imposing the tax or assessment. 
                  b.  All taxes and assessments imposed by the city shall be paid in full in legal tender of the United States; except where specifically authorized by law or ordinance of the mayor and board of aldermen. 
                  c.  Taxes and special assessments shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to the bank prime loan rate as posted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in statistical release H. 15 or any publication that may supersede it, plus three percent, to accrue monthly. Such annual interest rate shall be determined for each calendar year based on the first weekly posting of statistical release H. 15 on or after January 1 of each calendar year. Interest shall accrue from the date the tax or assessment is due until the date the tax or assessment is paid. For purposes of this section, any period of less than one month shall be considered to be one full month. The city treasurer or city manager may waive the collection of any interest, in whole or in part, due the city on unpaid taxes or assessments whenever or to the extent that he or she reasonably determines that the delay in payment was due to reasonable cause and not due to gross or willful neglect or disregard of the law or of regulations or instructions issued pursuant to the law. 
                  (3)  Penalties. 
                  a.  All penalties imposed herein are part of the tax or assessment and are to be collected as such. The proceedings to collect the original tax, the tax constituted from penalties imposed, and the interest shall all be conducted in the same manner. Any provision of law for criminal prosecution shall not operate to relieve any taxpayer of any tax, penalty, or interest imposed herein. 
                  b.  In any instance in which any taxpayer fails to pay a tax or assessment within 120 days after the due date, he shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount of the tax due, together with interest as specified herein as allowed in O.C.G.A. § 48-3-3. If any tax amount remains due after 120 days from the imposition of such initial penalty, an additional penalty of 5 percent of the amount of the tax due shall be imposed on the taxpayer, together with any interest as specified by O.C.G.A. § 48-3-3. Should any tax amount remain due 120 days from the imposition of such additional penalty, another penalty of five percent shall be imposed, together with any interest as specified by O.C.G.A. § 48-3-3. The aggregate amount of penalties imposed pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed an amount equal to 20 percent of the principal amount of the tax originally due. 
                  (4)  Executions on delinquent taxes and assessments. 
                  a.  As soon as the last day for the payment of taxes and assessments has arrived, the city treasurer shall notify in writing the taxpayer of the fact that the taxes have not been paid and that, unless paid within 30 days, an execution shall be issued. 
                  b.  The city treasurer shall issue executions, signed by the city clerk, for the nonpayment of taxes and assessments at any time after 30 days have elapsed since giving notice as provided in subsection (4)a. of this section. The execution shall identify the defendant in fi. fa., (taxpayer), the year(s) for which delinquent taxes are being executed, and the amount thereof. Executions shall be directed to "all and singular sheriffs and constables of the state" as required by O.C.G.A. § 48-3-3. 
                  c.  The city treasurer shall cause all executions issued to be recorded on the general execution docket of the county where the property is located, in the case of real property, and, in the case of personal property, in the county of the taxpayer's residence if a resident of the state, otherwise in the county where any real or personal property of the taxpayer may be found. If the taxpayer is not a resident of the state and has no known real or personal property within the state, the execution shall be recorded in the county in which the act or activity giving rise to tax liability took place. 
                  d.  All executions issued shall continue to bear interest and penalties at the rates established in this section for past due taxes and assessments. 
                  e.  The city treasurer shall cause all executions issued to be placed in the hands of the police chief for collection or levy and sale of property. The police chief shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi. fa. In the event he is unable to do so, the police chief shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi. fa.'s property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this Code section. 
                  (5)  Levy of executions; sale of property. 
                  a.  The police chief is hereby designated as the marshal of the city and delegated the duties set forth herein. The police chief shall be subject to accounting for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. After first paying the city treasurer the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant in accordance with Georgia law. 
                  b.  In all cases of levying on real property, within five days' written notice of the levy must be given personally, or delivered by certified mail, to the defendant in fi. fa. and to any known tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi. fa. therein. 
                  c.  Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give 20 days' written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The 20-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner of the land, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city treasurer. 
                  d.  When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi. fa. shall be given at least ten days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery as follows: 
                  1.  In cases of executions issued by a municipal officer for ad valorem taxes, to the property owner's last known address as listed in the records of the municipal officer of the municipality that issued the tax execution; or 
                  2.  In cases of executions issued by a county officer for ad valorem taxes, the property owner's last known address as listed in the records of the tax commission of the county that issued the tax execution. 
                  A copy of the notice provided for herein shall also be sent by the same tax officer sending the notice to the property owner to the appropriate tax official of the state, county or municipality which also has issued an execution with respect to such property. In addition, if the United States has a claim or lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than 30 days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his delegate not less than 25 days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. 
                  e.  The marshal shall publish weekly for four weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the property owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for collection of taxes due to the city and the year(s) for which taxes have been executed. 
                  f.  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal before the city hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time or eastern daylight savings time, which is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided, however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the city, make any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied. 
                  g.  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this Code section shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy or sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired. 
                  h.  Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered a reasonable time, the marshal may either re-advertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids. 
                  (6)  Bidding by city at tax sales; disposition of property acquired. 
                  a.  If, during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city manager, or his designee, may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
                  b.  Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder, however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided herein. 
                  c.  The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in the manner set forth herein. 
                  (7)  Accounting by marshal; final return or settlement. 
                  a.  The marshal shall make a prompt accounting to the finance director for all executions placed in his hands for collection or levy and sale. He shall pay to the finance director all amounts due the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties, and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs, and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5, as may be amended from time to time or may be paid into the registry of the superior court. 
                  b.  In any event, within 90 days from the date executions are placed in his hands, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he shall so notify the city treasurer in writing. It shall be the duty of the city treasurer to cause cancellation of executions on the general execution docket of the county upon their final payment or collection. 
                  c.  On fulfilling the duties outlined herein, the marshal shall seek assistance from the city treasurer as needed, in the discretion of the marshal. 
                  (8)  Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment. 
                  a.  Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi. fa. on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city treasurer, in the name of the city, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he or she believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi. fa. or who has property, money, or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi. fa. The city treasurer shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued. 
                  b.  When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of "nulla bona" has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately preceding 30-day period and the city treasurer has reason to believe the defendant in fi. fa. may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state, the city treasurer, in the name of the city, may petition the superior court of the county in this state in which the defendant in fi. fa. maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi. fa. does not maintain a known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, as may be amended from time to time. 
                  (9)  Redemption rights of defendant in fi. fa.; vesting of title in grantee. 
                  a.  Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as provided by Georgia law. 
                  (10)  Costs. 
                  a.  For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the clerk of superior court for recording and cancellations of the tax fi. fa. 
                  b.  Once a levy is made or posted on the property of a defendant in fi. fa., in addition to all taxes, interest, penalties and cost heretofore accrued, the marshal shall collect a levy administration fee of five percent of the taxes due or $250.00, whichever is the lesser; however, no levy administration fee shall be less than $50.00. 
                  c.  In addition to the levy administration fees, after levy, but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale, not to exceed eight percent on sums of $50.00 or less, six percent on sums above $50.00 up to $550.00, and three percent on all sums exceeding $550.00. 
                  d.  The costs provided in this section shall be cumulative and in addition to any statutory premiums allowed as a part of the redemption price.

No penalty or interest shall be charged during the first ten days of the extension period. Thereafter, interest shall be collected on the unpaid balance at the rate set forth in O.C.G.A.

Adoption of this article is not to be relied upon as a determination by the city that operation of a PTV on public roads is safe or advisable if done in accordance with this article. By regulating such operation, the city is merely addressing safety issues. All persons who operate or ride in PTVs on public roads do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.

                  Secs. 98-1—98-30. - Reserved. 
                  ARTICLE II. - TREES 
                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 98-31. - Intent; purpose. 
                  (a)  Trees are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element to the survival of man, and appreciably reduce the ever-increasing and environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air. Trees precipitate dust and other particulate airborne pollutants from the air. Trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the air washer device employed in commercial air conditioning systems. Trees play a vital role in neutralizing wastewater passing through the ground from the surface to groundwater table and lower aquifers. Trees, through their root systems, stabilize the groundwater table. Tree leaves break the onslaught of pelting rain drops upon the soil surface and give the soil a chance to soak up as much water as possible, and when falling, covering the ground to keep the soil from drying out, and by decaying, replace minerals in the soil and enrich it to support later plant growth. Trees play a pronounced and important part in communitywide soil conservation, erosion control and reduce stormwater runoff. Trees contribute food and shelter for wildlife in the urban and suburban environment. Trees are an invaluable psychological counterpart to the manmade urban and suburban setting, camouflaging harsh scenery and unsightly cityscape and softening the outline of masonry, metal and glass. Trees increase the value of property and are valuable property assets that can affect an area economically, beautifying the land and breaking the monotony of endless sidewalks and miles of highways and streets. 
                  (b)  The board of aldermen finds that it is in the best interest of the public to provide standards for the preservation and/or replacement of trees as part of the land development and building construction process for the purpose of making the city a more attractive place to live; providing a healthy living environment; and better maintaining control of stormwater runoff, noise, glare and soil erosion.

                      Land disturbance permit means the authorization necessary to begin a land disturbing activity under the provisions of this article. 
                      Land disturbing activity means any land change that may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into the waters or into land within the city or county, including but not limited to clearing, grubbing, stripping, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land. 
                      Protected zone means all lands that fall outside the buildable area of a parcel, all areas of the parcel required to remain in open space, and all designated buffers or tree save areas, or conditions of zoning approval. 
                      Tree means any living, self-supporting woody perennial plant that has a trunk diameter of two inches or more measured at a point six inches above the ground and normally obtains a height of at least ten feet at maturity, usually with one main stem or trunk and many branches.

                  (a)  The subdivider shall pay the cost of, or guarantee payment for, the cost of the storm drainage system in a manner suitable to the City of Acworth, prior to said installation. 
                  (b)  The storm drainage system may be included in the sanitary sewer plan for subdivision required in section 30, provided the two systems are kept separate. 
                  (c)  The size, location, and length of all surface drainage pipe or structures shall be shown on final plans and shall be subject to the approval of the administrator. Storm drain pipes 42 inches and smaller carrying stormwater from the street of adjacent property between or through lots shall be extended at least 60 feet behind the building line and in no cases shall be allowed to be discharged at a point where the water would cause damage to any existing or future structure. All cross drain pipes and pipes under the roadway and shoulder shall be either asphalt coated corrugated metal pipe invert paved (paved invert required only on running streams) or reinforced concrete pipe of such gauge and strength according to the height of fill as specified by the state highway specifications. (See section 29(b)(7).) 
                  (d)  Installation, backfilling and compaction shall be in accordance with the state highway specifications. (See section 29(b)(7).) All pipes shall have minimum cover of one foot and headwalls or inlet basins constructed at end of pipes. No concrete block headwalls shall be permitted. 
                  (e)  The design of drainage structures shall be based on Talbot's Formula, a minimum constant of 0.8 shall be used, the design drainage area and constant shall be shown on the final plat for each pipe or culvert opening. 
                  (f)  Any lots within the subdivision which, in the opinion of the administrator, are undesirable for building due to bad drainage conditions shall be excluded and no building shall be permitted thereon until such conditions have been corrected as specified by the administrator. 
                  (g)  In special cases where it is the desire of the subdivision developer or owner to leave running streams open for aesthetic purposes, this may be permitted upon approval by the administrator. Whenever open streams are permitted, such streams shall retain their natural design characteristics and be so designed that they do not present a maintenance problem to the city and that they do not present a hazard to life and safety. 
                  (h)  Five copies of the plans of the storm drainage system of the subdivisions shall be submitted to, checked and approved by the administrator prior to installation. Said system shall be designed in accordance with the State of Georgia 1983 State Highway Department Specifications, volumes I and II. 
                  Section 32. - Water Supply System. 
                  (a)  Each lot or other site in a subdivision shall be connected to a public water supply system by lines of sufficient size to accommodate the anticipated water demand for domestic and firefighting purposes. Fire hydrants in residential subdivisions shall be no more than 400 feet from the center of the lot at the building line (distance shall be measured along hose lay). Nonresidential subdivisions shall have fire hydrants no more than 500 feet apart. Lot service connections shall be stubbed in so that there will be no necessity for cutting into any pavement in order to make any future connections. The subdivider shall pay the cost of, or guarantee payment for the cost of the water supply system, in a manner suitable to the City of Acworth. 
                  (b)  Five copies of the plan of the water supply system of the subdivision, showing the seal of a registered professional engineer, surveyor or landscape architect, shall be submitted to, checked and approved by the administrator prior to installation. Said system shall be designed in accordance with the State of Georgia 1983 State Highway Department Specifications, volumes I and II. 
                  Section 33. - Coordination of Installation. 
                      All underground work such as sewers and water lines shall be installed and each backfill compacted before street pavement is laid. 
                  Section 34. - Experimental Subdivisions. 
                  (a)  The administrator may waive, vary, or modify the standards and requirements of these regulations if, in his judgment, an unusual or experimental subdivision might prove of considerable merit toward: 
                  (1)  The use of unusual materials in constructing required improvements; and/or 
                  (2)  A new or untried design concept in the Acworth area which appears promising. 
                  (b)  Special attention may be given to experimental subdivisions which are related to low-cost housing design in an effort to provide housing for lower income families. The administrator shall require the subdivider to provide a written proposal stating the nature of the experiment. 
                  Section 35. - Conditions. 
                      In granting modifications, the administrator may require such conditions as will, in his judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards of requirements so modified. 
                  Section 36. - Conflict With Other Laws. 
                      Whenever these subdivision regulations impose more restrictive standards than are required in or under any federal or state law or applicable local ordinances, the requirements of these regulations shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any applicable federal, state or local ordinances require more restrictive standards than are required by these subdivision regulations the provisions of such laws or ordinances shall govern. 
                  Section 37. - Penalties for Transferring Lot in Unapproved Subdivisions. 
                  (a)  Whoever, being owner or agent of any land located within a subdivision, transfers or sells any land in such subdivision before such plat has been approved by the mayor and board of aldermen and recorded or filed in the office of the clerk of the superior court of Cobb County, Georgia, shall forfeit and pay a penalty of $100.00 for each lot or parcel so transferred or sold; and the description of such lot or parcel by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties or from the remedies herein provided. 
                  (b)  The city may enjoin such transfer or sale or agreement by action for injunction brought in any court of equity jurisdiction or may recover the same penalty by civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  Section 38. - Final Subdivision Plat. 
                      Previously approved final subdivision plats are exempt from the requirement of this ordinance unless the development of such plans has not been undertaken within a period of two years (24 months) from the date of approval. 
                  Section 39. - [Severability.] 
                      It is hereby declared to be the intention of this ordinance that its sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases are severable; and if any section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance is declared to be unconstitutional or invalid, it shall not effect any of the remaining sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases of this ordinance.
