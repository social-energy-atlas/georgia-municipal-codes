PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Thomas County, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Laura Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Rick Morrison, County Manager, Ms. Ruth Jones, County Clerk, and Mr. Bruce Warren, County Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

An Ordinance Adopting and Enacting a New Code for Thomas County, Georgia Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein; Providing a Penalty for the Violation Thereof; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; and Providing When Such Code and This Ordinance Shall Become Effective.

Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before September 14, 1993, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
Section 3. The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the county may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief, and revocation of licenses or permits. 
Section 5. Additions and amendments to the Code, when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the county to make the same a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

Sec. 14-28. - Airport zones. 
In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and conical surfaces as they apply to Thomasville Municipal Airport. Such zones are shown on the Thomasville Municipal Airport and Vicinity Plan (also known as the zoning map) consisting of one sheet, which is made a part hereof and is on file in the office of the clerk of the board of commissioners. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Utility runway visual approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(2)  Runway larger than utility visual approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(3)  Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than three-fourths mile nonprecision instrument approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(4)  Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as three-fourths mile nonprecision instrument approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(5)  Precision instrument runway approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(6)  Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces. 
(7)  Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways designated utility of visual and 10,000 feet for all others from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. 
(8)  Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. 
(Ord. of 11-13-84(2), § II) 
Sec. 14-29. - Airport zone height limitations. 
Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure shall be erected, altered or maintained and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this article to a height in excess of the applicable height established in this section for such zone.

(a)  Application. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article may apply to the board of commissioners for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the board of commissioners unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the county manager for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the county manager does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the board of commissioners may act on its own to grant or deny the application. 
(b)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the City of Thomasville, Georgia, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights. 
(Ord. of 11-13-84(2), § VI) 
Sec. 14-33. - Enforcement. 
It shall be the duty of the county manager to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed in this article.

Project improvements means site specific improvements or facilities that are planned, designed, or built to provide service for a specific development project and that are necessary for the use and convenience of the occupants or users of that project only, and that are not "system" improvements. The character of the improvement shall control a determination of whether an improvement is a "project" improvement or a "system" improvement, and the physical location of the improvement on-site or off-site shall not be considered determinative of whether an improvement is a "project" improvement or a "system" improvement. A project improvement may provide no more than incidental service or facility capacity to persons other than users or occupants of the particular project they serve.

Projected interest charges and other finance costs may be included if the impact fees are to be used for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, notes, or other financial obligations issued to finance system improvements, but such costs do not include routine and periodic maintenance expenditures, personnel training, and other operating costs. 
System improvements means capital improvements that are public facilities designed to provide service to more than one project or to the community at large, in contrast to "project" improvements. 
Unit of development means the standard incremental measure of land development activity for a specific type of land use upon which the rate of demand for public service and facilities is based, such as a dwelling unit, square foot of floor area, motel room, etc.

Sec. 18-114. - Imposition of development impact fees. 
Any person who after the effective date of this article engages in development shall pay a development impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this article. 
(1)  Construction not subject to impact fees. The following projects and construction activities do not constitute "development" as defined in this article, and are therefore not subject to the imposition of impact fees: 
a.  Rebuilding no more than the same number of units of development as defined in this article that were removed by demolition, or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe, on the same lot or property. 
b.  Remodeling or repairing a structure that does not result in an increase in the number of units of development. 
c.  Replacing a residential housing unit with another housing unit on the same lot or property. 
d.  Placing or replacing a manufactured home in a manufactured home park on a prepared manufactured home pad in existence and operation prior to the effective date of this article.

f.  Constructing an addition to or expansion of a residential housing unit that does not increase the number of housing units. 
g.  Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses and intended for the personal use of the residents, such as a deck or patio, satellite antenna, pet enclosure, or private recreational facilities such as a swimming pool. 
(2)  Grandfathered projects. Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, that portion of a project for which a valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this article shall not be subject to development impact fees so long as the permit remains valid and construction is commenced and is pursued according to the terms of the permit. 
(3)  Method of calculation. 
a.  Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this article shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Plan. 
b.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, the calculation of impact fees shall be net of credits for the present value of ad valorem taxes or other revenues as established in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Plan, and which: 
1.  Are reasonably expected to be generated by new growth and development; and 
2.  Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed. 
c.  The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this article shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of Thomas County, Georgia, and may be amended from time to time by official act. 
d.  In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities, as established in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Plan. 
e.  Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(Ord. of 10-4-07, § 4) 
Sec. 18-115. - Fee assessment and payment. 
(a)  Fee schedule. 
(1)  Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment A* for a property located inside of Thomas County, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by Thomas County, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(2)  When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. 
(3)  In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then: 
a.  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee. 
b.  In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule. 
c.  If a land use designation is not in a category contained in this article, then an appropriate new category may be added by the administrator and an appropriate fee established under the county's current impact fee methodology, subject to annual confirmation by the board of commissioners. 
d.  Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this article. 
(b)  Timing of assessment and payment. 
(1)  Development impact fees shall be assessed at the time of application for a building permit. 
(2)  All development impact fees shall be collected no later than the time of issuance of a building permit. 
(3)  For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property. 
(4)  If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy. An adjustment may result in a refund to the feepayor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid. 
(5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit. 
(c)  Individual assessment determinations. Individual assessments of development impact fees may be established as follows: 
(1)  At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project in lieu of the fee established on the fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment A*. 
(2)  In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. Each individual assessment study shall: 
a.  Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data; or 
b.  Be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in Thomas County or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to accepted methodology; and 
c.  Provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination. 
(3)  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this article. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this article. 
(4)  Any fee approved as an individual assessment determination shall have standing for 180 days following the date of approval. Payment of such an approved individual assessment determination shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by Thomas County, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(d)  Fee certification. Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certification of the development impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment A* or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable. Such certified schedule or fee shall establish the development impact fee due for a period of 180 days from the date of certification, even if new or revised rate schedules are adopted in the interim. 
(Ord. of 10-4-07, § 5) 
Sec. 18-116. - Exemptions. 
(a)  Exemption policy. Thomas County recognizes that certain office, retail trade and industrial development projects provide extraordinary benefit in support of the economic advancement of the county's citizens over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general. To encourage such development projects, the board of commissioners may consider granting a reduction in the impact fee for such a development project upon the determination and relative to the extent that the business or project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to Thomas County, in accordance with adopted exemption criteria. It is also recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees. 
(Ord. of 10-4-07, § 6) 
Sec. 18-117. - Deposit and expenditure of fees.

b.  If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) prior to the effective date of this article for system improvements that are included for impact fee funding in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan, is greater than the impact fee that would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, any credit due under this section shall not constitute a liability of Thomas County, and shall accrue to the developer to the extent of impact fees assessed for new development for the same category of system improvements within the same service area. 
c.  In no event shall credit be given for project improvements, or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(2)  Granting of credits. 
a.  Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that: 
1.  The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan;

a.  For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated. 
b.  For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated. 
c.  For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that Thomas County, Georgia would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less. 
d.  For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest accepted by the county, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated. 
e.  In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a State of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the board of commissioners in its sole discretion may deem appropriate.

Sec. 18-119. - Refunds. 
(a)  Eligibility for a refund.

8.  To suspend any law, code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension; 
9.  To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes;

Sec. 42-30. - Abatement authorized. 
The chief building official or his designee is hereby designated as the public officer to enforce this article and is authorized to abate any nuisance existing in the county, whether or not such nuisance is specifically recognized by this article.

Execution shall issue as in the case of county taxes, and the procedure for the enforcement of such execution shall thereafter be the same as in the case of county taxes. Where the address of the person to be served is known, or where there is a last known address, a copy of the notice shall also be mailed to such person at that address by certified mail return receipt requested.

Sec. 42-74. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsection 42-74(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 42-74(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as ten a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 42-74(b)(2) of this article; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are Implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
c.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions, which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection 42-74(b) and (c) of this article. 
d.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

Editor's note— Ord. of 6-9-09(3), §§ 1—8, amending §§ 42-96—42-103 shows an adoption date of June 21, 1999, however documentation from the county confirms change of adoption date to June 9, 2009. 

Sec. 42-96. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within Thomas County, Georgia, are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a Wetlands Protection Ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder. 
(b)  Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of Thomas County, Georgia. The purposes of this ordinance are to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. The objective of this article is to make the public aware of state and federal laws that protect wetlands from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife. 
(Ord. of 6-21-99, § 1; Ord. of 6-9-09(3), § 1) 
Sec. 42-97. - Definitions. 
Functions. The beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: storage, conveyance, and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical, and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic, and recreational amenities. 
Generalized wetland map. A map depicting jurisdictional wetlands within Thomas County. 
Hydric soils. Soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the Soil Conservation Service. 
Hydrophytic vegetation. Macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
Jurisdictional wetland. A wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
Regulated activity. Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
Silviculture. The art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees. 
Wetland. An area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophilic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 
Wetland delineation. The establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps. 
Wetland protection district. All wetlands within the jurisdiction of Thomas County, Georgia which are indicated on the generalized wetland map as "wetlands providing significant wildlife habitat and/or which may be subject to extensive mitigation". 
(Ord. of 6-21-99, § 2; Ord. of 6-9-09(3), § 2) 
Sec. 42-98. - Wetland protection district established. 
(a)  Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as defined herein and located within the jurisdiction of Thomas County, Georgia. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection district and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the Thomas County Building Department. 
(b)  Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 Permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of Thomas County, Georgia, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

If the area proposed for development is located within 25 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a Section 404 Permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 Permit or letter of permission. 
(b)  Permissible uses (use as a right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, drainage, or dredging except as provided herein.

Secs. 42-135—42-155. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VI. - PROTECTED RIVER CORRIDORS 

Sec. 42-156. - Purpose. 
River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Georgia. These corridors are of vital importance to Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters. 
The Ochlocknee River, Little Ochlocknee River, and the Aucilla River has been designated as protected rivers by the State of Georgia. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Ochlocknee River, Little Ochlocknee River, and the Aucilla River as defined herein. 
(Ord. of 6-9-09(4), § I) 
Sec. 42-157. - Definitions. 
(a)  Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 C.F.R. Section 261.3. (Note: This is same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.) 
(b)  Land disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land-disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
(c)  Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "the Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species. 
(d)  Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year. 
(e)  Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400-cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. 
(f)  Public utility or utilities means a service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service or services and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services. 
(g)  River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
(h)  River corridor means all the land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440 through 12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280 through 12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within 150 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. 
The 150-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river banks, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 150-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection boundaries. 
Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs. 
(i)  Sensitive natural area means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following: 
(1)  Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species; 
(2)  Rare or exemplary natural communities; 
(3)  Significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or 
(4)  Other areas so designated by the Department of Natural Resources; and which are sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration.

ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 50-26. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
(a)  Authorization. Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Thomas County, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
(1)  Findings of fact. 
a.  The flood hazard areas of unincorporated Thomas County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
b.  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(2)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
a.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
b.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
c.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
d.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
e.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(3)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
a.  To protect human life and health; 
b.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
c.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
d.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
e.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
f.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and; 
g.  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

(4)  Floodway —Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-52, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if subsection 50-102(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4.

Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Subdivision the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its original value before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 82-50. - Driveway installation policy. 
(a)  Driveway installation fees on county maintained roads . Four hundred dollars ($400.00) for 15-inch, 18-inch and 24-inch metal or plastic pipe, up to three tandem loads of dirt and the crew charge. Pipes larger than 24-inches diameter or concrete pipe is to be charged at cost plus $225.00 for up to three tandem loads of dirt and a $75.00 crew charge. All headwalls requested or necessary will cost $225.00 for up to three tandem loads of dirt and a $75.00 crew charge. Should it require more dirt than the three tandem loads on an installation requiring a pipe or a dry ramp, $75.00 per additional load will be charged. Cement band charges will apply where applicable. All maintenance replacements deemed necessary by the public works department will be of no charge to the property owner. Specific request from the property owner for an upgrade to larger diameter pipe not deemed necessary by the public works department shall be charged at the standard installation fee/policies. Specific requests from property owners to remove a driveway will be charged at half of the current rate - $225.00. 
Driveway extensions prices will be based on the actual pipe cost, dirt charge, crew charge, $10.00 cut charge and current county cost for a connector band or cement and any other applicable charges for dirt or headwalls. 
(b)  Driveway installation fees on state routes. These rates/policies will apply for all installations on state routes, as well as an additional cost for the flared end sections required by DOT (sold at county cost). 
These rates will become effective April 1, 2002. 
(c)  Installation of safety flared ends on new driveways . Safety flared ends will be installed on all new driveway installations on paved roads, with the exception of platted, paved subdivision roads classified as "minor" roads, defined herein and classified by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners as a low volume, low speed, residential road that primarily serves the residents of the subdivision. A subdivision road or street that may be used as a cut through or connector road to a main road may not be considered a "minor" road. There may be areas in which larger drainage structures are necessary requiring flared ends. This decision will be at the discretion of the public works director. Paved subdivision roads classified as "minor" may have masonry or other type vertical walls constructed by the property owner or their contractor so long as the walls conform to the existing regulations as stated in the Thomas County Right-of-Way Encroachment Ordinance, adopted May 14, 2002, that specifies the walls shall not extend beyond the height of the driveway or come within four and one-half feet of the edge of pavement. Thomas County does not accept maintenance responsibility for these vertical wall structures.

Sec. 82-51. - Right-of-way encroachment—mailboxes and other structures. 
This section applies to all arterial, collector and minor roads as defined by the Thomas County Subdivision Rules and Regulations. 
(1)  Mailboxes. No mailbox support shall be allowed to exist on Thomas County's right-of-way that interferes with the safety of the traveling public on the county highway system. A mailbox that does not conform to the following provisions is an encroachment and shall be removed within 60 days of notification of the violation. [2] 
The mailbox shall be located in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Postmaster General. The support or post shall not be made of a masonry nature or by any other material that will not readily yield upon impact; nor shall any other construction which could be classified as a hazardous fixed object be allowed; either as a support or as an encasement or housing for the box itself. When using wood, the size shall be a maximum nominal four inch by four inch or if round, the size will be a maximum or four inches in diameter. If a metal post is to be used, no larger than three inches in diameter or equivalent shall be allowed and such posts shall be hollow. When using other materials, the maximum size and configuration shall be determined and approved by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners prior to installation. The face of the mailbox shall be no closer than three feet to the edge of the pavement on high-speed routes. 
Multiple mailbox installations shall meet the same criteria as single mailbox installations. Multiple support installations should have their supports separated a minimum distance equal to three-fourths of their heights above ground. This will reduce interaction between adjacent mailboxes and supports. 
(2)  Mailboxes—Subdivision roads with low traffic volume and speed. Subdivision roads with low traffic volume and speed, as determined by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners, shall comply with the following standards: 
The face of the mailbox shall be no closer than two feet to the edge of the pavement or one foot from the back of the curb. 
Thomas County will assume no liability for damage that may occur in the normal maintenance operations for any mailbox not conforming to the standards previously stated in subsection (1). 
A mailbox that does not conform to the following provisions is an encroachment and shall be removed within 60 days of notification of the violation. [3] 
(3)  Mailboxes—Existing structures. Single entrance subdivision roads with a minor road classification that have existing brick or masonry mailbox structures will be allowed so long as they meet the following requirements: 
a.  No portion of the mailbox or its structure shall be closer than two feet to the edge of pavement or one foot from the back of the curb. 
b.  Any damage to existing brick or masonry mailbox structures during routine maintenance of the street will be the liability of the property owner. 
The board of commissioners reserves the right to review all existing mailbox structures on a case-by-case basis as requested. 
All undeveloped lots within a subdivision on a single entrance, low volume, low speed road shall conform to the current specifications for mailbox structures. Masonry or brick structures are allowed and placement of the face of the mailbox shall be no closer than two feet to the edge of pavement or one foot from the back of the curb. 
(4)  Other structures. Masonry or other type vertical walls that create a hazard will not be allowed on county rights-of-way. 
Existing masonry or other type walls built on driveways will comply with the following regulation: These walls shall not extend beyond the height of the driveway or come within four and one-half feet of the edge of the pavement. Structures not conforming to these regulations are an encroachment and shall be removed within 90 days of notification of the violation. [4] 
Thomas County will assume no liability for damage that may occur in the normal maintenance operations for any cosmetic structure. 
(5)  Enforcement (existing structures). It shall be the responsibility of the public works director to enforce the provisions of this section as it relates to existing structures. The public works director shall notify, in writing, property owners found to be in violation of this section. If the property owners fail to remove the structures(s) in violation within the time allowed by this section, the public works director is authorized to issue a citation to the property owner stating the nature of the violation, the cost to the property owner for removal and the time and date the matter will be reviewed by the board of commissioners. A copy of the citation shall be sent to the chief building inspector. The public works director shall refer the citation to the board of commissioners at its earliest regularly scheduled meeting. The board shall review the facts and if the property owner if found in violation, the public works director shall be authorized and directed to remove structures in violation and to bill the property owner the cost of removal. 
(6)  Enforcement (new construction). It shall be the responsibility of the chief building inspector to enforce the provisions of this section as it relates to all new construction. In addition, the chief building inspector is directed and authorized to deny any and all construction permits for any property or to any property owner with structure(s) in violation of this section as cited by the public works director. 
(7)  Other structures—Exemption. 
a.  New construction. Masonry or other type vertical walls may be built on driveways that are located in a platted subdivision on a "minor" road, defined herein and classified by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners as a low volume, low speed, residential road that primarily serves the residents of the subdivision. A subdivision road or street that may be used as a cut through or connector road to a main road may not be considered a "minor" road. These structures must conform to the existing regulations as stated in this section. Thomas County does not accept maintenance responsibility for these vertical wall structures. 
(8)  Other structures. 
a.  Single entrance subdivision roads with a minor road classification that have existing brick, rubble, or masonry driveway headwalls will be allowed so long as they meet the following requirements: 
1.  The wall shall not come within four and one-half feet of the edge of pavement.

Sec. 82-64. - Community facilities and services. 
The mapping of the service areas and/or levels of services for the future needs of the community relating to public facilities and infrastructure to accommodate future development in Thomas County requires consistency in agreements with the "Service Delivery Strategy" and governmental entities providing the facilities and services (City of Thomasville, a public provider). 
The major public facilities and services are: 
• Water supply and treatment, both distribution and treatment systems, whether publicly or privately operated 
• Sewage system and wastewater treatment, both collection and treatment systems, whether publicly or privately owned 
(1)  Sewage. 
The Thomas County Land Use Ordinance provides for the creation of a "district" boundary in Thomas County, known as the "Suburban District" and to provide that subdivisions developed in the suburban district be required to provide a sewage collection system which delivers all sewage collected in the proposed subdivision to an EPD approved treatment facility. 
An EPD approved facility for treatment shall be required as a condition for approval of a subdivision. 
Centralized collection and treatment of sewage: 
All plans for development of subdivisions in the suburban service district must have included in the plans submitted for technical review and final plat approval, a completely designed sewage collection system which provides for collection of all sewage from each lot located in the subdivision and delivery of the sewage to an EPD approved treatment facility. 
Where septic tanks are approved as a "conditional" installation for development, the design engineer shall design a "dry pipe" sewage collection system and the developer shall install the approved piping system in all future subdivision development in the suburban district. When public sewer or water service systems become available near the subdivision, all lots shall connect at the developer's cost or deed restriction. A clearly defined legal document shall be executed and enforceable against the property owners when applicable. 
These requirements may be applied to "other" districts in Thomas County as feasibility or future "master plans" for networking of water and sewer are designed. 
(2)  Water supply. 
A water supply system includes the water supply, the treatment facilities, transmission lines, and the local distribution network. 
Adequate pressures are necessary for fire fighting and general service of potable water service to the residents. 
The water utility company shall be responsible for the water quality and operation of the distribution system. A water utility can be a public entity or a privately owned utility, providing potable water for a profit. 
The private utility company's design shall be reviewed by the Thomas County Technical Review Committee to ensure conformance with local standards. The design analysis must also include fire flow requirements. 
Whether the water supply company is public or private, the design must comply with the County Health Department, State of Georgia DNR, and EPD Standards for approval of a public water system. 
a.  All construction plans shall be prepared and sealed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. 
b.  All engineered plans shall be reviewed and approved by the Thomas County Technical Review Committee prior to the developer/engineer submitting plans to any other governmental agencies. 
c.  The location, design, and construction of public water systems shall comply with Thomas County's "Technical Standards Manual" (future TBA). 
d.  All construction and installation of public water systems shall be performed by a licensed "utility contractor" by the State of Georgia. 
e.  All distribution water systems, public or private, may be located entirely within rights-of-way or private property permanent recorded easements, and be subject to approval of the public works director. 
f.  If an adequate public/private water supply is within 1,000 feet of the subdivision, the subdivider shall install a system of water mains, fire hydrants, and connections to serve each lot in the development. 
Where public/private water lines are unavailable, the nonpublic water system shall be approved by the Department of Natural Resources, EPD drinking water division. 
(Res. of 6-9-09(2)(Exh. 2), § 304) 
Sec. 82-65. - Design requirements. 
(a)  Design requirements. For water main sizing, distribution lines, pressure requirements, and water flow for fire protection. 
(FUTURE) Refer to "Thomas County Technical Standards Manual" for design specifications and standards relating to installation of sewage systems and water systems. 
(b)  Procedures for acceptance and/or approval of water systems and sewage systems. The technical review committee shall have powers and duties to review, modify, and approve development plans or subdivision plats and prepare its findings for submission to the Thomas County Board of Commissioners for final approval. The technical review committee shall provide the coordinated review and approvals to determine district boundaries, new or existing, public water and sewer service areas or private/franchise areas of public water and sewer service areas. 
The technical review committee shall assist in the development of a "master plan" of water and sewer systems that will connect, extend, or continue to create a network of adequate infrastructure for future expansion. The water and sewer "master plan" shall be a document approved by the board of commissioners, prepared by a consulting firm, engineers, and the technical review committee. 
(c)  Other design requirements. 
Fire protection: The Chief of the Thomas County Fire Department shall review all subdivision plans to assure compliance with the specifications and design requirements for water main sizing, fire flow, and hydrant spacing. 
(1)  Minimum size of water mains and spacing of fire hydrants for future construction and development:

3.120 - Official Land Use Standards Atlas. 
The boundaries shown on the Land Use Standards Atlas Maps, Comprehensive Plan, and this Land Use Standards Ordinance identify the various districts shown above and define the uses allowed within the defined boundaries of each district. 
The boundaries are as follows: 

 
3.121  Atlas location. The maps upon which the boundaries of the land use standards districts established in Section 3.110 are shown constitute the Official Land Use Standards Atlas. The Official Land Use Standards Atlas is filed in the Office of the Planning Director and is incorporated as a part of this ordinance, and is as much a part of this ordinance as if the information contained therein was set out in full in this ordinance. 
3.122  District boundaries. In the event that any uncertainty exists with respect to the intended boundaries of the various land use standards districts as shown on the Official Land Use Standards Atlas, the Planning Director shall make the interpretation using the following rules: 
(1)  The land use standards district boundaries are the center lines of roads, alleys, waterways, and rights-of-way unless otherwise indicated. Wherever designation of a boundary line coincides with the location of a road, alley, waterway, or right-of-way, it shall be construed to be the boundary of such district. 
(2)  Where the land use standards district boundaries do not coincide with the location of roads, alleys, waterways, and rights-of-way, but do coincide with lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be the boundary of such district. 
(3)  Where the land use standards district boundaries do not coincide with the location of roads, alleys, waterways, and rights-of-way or lot lines, the land use standards district boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Land Use Standards Atlas. 
3.123  Base building line setback requirements. Base building lines are hereby established from which all front, side, and rear yard setbacks are to be measured. For all public roads in Thomas County, the base building line dimension from center line of right-of-way shall be thirty-five (35) feet. When a right-of-way from center line is greater than thirty-five (35) feet, yard setbacks shall be measured from the right-of-way line. Where no right-of-way line can be determined, the base building line dimension shall be measured from the centerline of the road or street. 
Section 3.200 - Regulations of general applicability. 
3.210 - Uses. 
3.211 - Permitted uses. 
No structure shall be constructed, built, moved, remodeled, reconstructed, used, nor shall any land be used or occupied except in accordance with the requirements of the land use standards district in which it is located, unless it was a nonconforming use at the time the district was created. See Section 3.261 of this ordinance for nonconformities. 
3.212 - Conditional zoning. 
The Thomas County Board of Commissioners imposes conditions on any zoning proposal which would be in the interest of public health, safety or welfare.

No structure or land shall be constructed, built, moved, remodeled, reconstructed, used, or occupied as a conditional use except as approved under the provisions of Section 4.300 or a variance from allowed uses established in the land use regulations granted by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners. 
3.214 - Limited use (LU) provision. 
The limited use provision allows an applicant to request that a certain property be classified as a limited use. In some areas of the County, a particular land use activity selected out of a general land use classification may have less community impact than some of the other uses within that classification. For this reason, an applicant may petition for a land use change of a property to a specified use only (i.e., C1-LU). The limited use must be among the uses permitted in the district for which the limited use was granted. If violated, the property would revert to the prior land use district classification. 
3.215 - Accessory uses and structures. 
Uses incidental to the zoning classification for any parcel of property. 
(1)  Authorization. Accessory uses and structures are permitted in any land use standards district in connection with any principal lawfully existing permitted or conditional use within such district.

3.218 - Protection of natural features and resources. 
General. 
The provisions set forth herein are intended to protect the natural features and natural resources within Thomas County and to implement policies in the comprehensive plan. The natural features and natural resources as follows relate to floodplain, water resource protection boundaries, wetlands, river corridors, and soil and erosion control intended to be protected by the Ordinance related to: 
Floodplain Damage Protection. 
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its 100-year floodplain study, dated March 9, 1990 with accompanying maps and other supporting data are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section and the Land Use Standards Ordinance. 
(1)  It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety, and welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. 
(2)  General construction standards must be met when there is an encroachment beyond a special flood hazard boundary. 
(3)  Thomas County Planning Department has information on supporting data for review of Federal Insurance Rate Maps and Thomas County's Flood Ordinance can be accessed on the website at Chapter 50, Article II, Floods. 
Water Resource Protection Boundaries. 
The intent of this section is to establish minimum development standards and regulations which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout Thomas County. The findings of the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan has determined that the management of these resources is essential to the health, safety, welfare, and economic well being of the public, and to provide a guide for future growth and development in our County. 
(A)  Three (3) water resource boundary protection areas are: 
1.  Water sheds 
2.  Wetlands 
3.  River corridors 
(B)  It is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured through management of land uses within Thomas County. 
River Corridor Protection. 
The following rivers have been designated as protected rivers by Thomas County and by the State of Georgia: 
1.  Ochlocknee River 
2.  Little Ochlocknee River 
3.  Aucilla River 
Purpose. 
River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Thomas County and the State of Georgia. 
Protection required. 
Shall comprise of all land, inclusive of islands in areas being within one hundred fifty (150) feet horizontally on both sides of the rivers as measured from the river banks. 
Protection criteria: 
The purpose of the river corridor criteria is to help maintain high water quality of the designated rivers by insuring that: 
A.  A natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained within the river corridor at all times, except as provided for in the Ordinance. Construction within the buffer is prohibited. 
B.  Uses and construction permitted in the corridor that creates no impairment or river functions. 
C.  Complete criteria as stated in the Protected River Corridor Ordinance in the Thomas County Subdivision Ordinance. 
D.  The standards and requirements in this section do not supersede those contained in the State River Protection Act and the Erosion and Sedimentation Act except that the one hundred fifty (150) foot buffer requirement exceeds the state standards. 
E.  The River Corridor Ordinance shall require a one hundred fifty (150) foot buffer as allowed by the State of Georgia. 
Wetlands Protection. 
General. 
A wetland is any sensitive and fragile natural resource with many development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. They provide a natural filtering of ground water for a higher quality of water, which migrates to our aquafers. These areas include the lands designated within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory Maps (N.W.I.) The N.W.I. are available at www.fws.gov/nwi. In addition, those areas included in the Thomas County Generalized Wetland areas depicted as wetland boundaries for a delineation of boundaries by the United States Army Corps of Engineer's as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. The landowner is, also, subject to federal or state permitting requirements. 
Protection Criteria (local permit or permission):

NFI—Natural Features Inventory. 
General. 
A natural features inventory (NFI) is an inventory of all environmentally significant features on a parcel of land that is proposed for development or subdivision. Significant features include wetlands, water bodies, watercourses, floodplains, native forests, and habitats for endangered plants and animals. 
I.  The requirement for a NFI inventory information can better ensure Thomas County and the developer in meeting local, state, and federal requirements for protecting various natural resources and features in Thomas County. 
II.  An environmental permit application "form" shall be submitted for review of the specific finding to the Planning and Zoning Department by a qualified professional or biologist. This information and study is used to concentrate development activity away from sensitive areas as referenced in the above boundaries requiring protection. A natural features inventory is required as a part of any application for development or subdivision. 
III.  Required applications for development or subdivisions: 
a.  Short form—Is required on ten (10) or fewer acres. If significant natural features are identified within the property, a long form will be required. 
b.  Long form—Is required for tracts larger than ten (10) acres as well as parcels of less than ten (10) acres if significant natural resources are found. The form will require a narrative of all natural features located within the site and a natural features overlay map identifying all significant areas requiring protection. 
Natural features inventory forms are available at Thomas County Planning and Zoning Department. Completed forms may be submitted to the Thomas County Planning Director at regularly scheduled Technical Review Committee meetings. Thomas County staff will have fifteen (15) days to complete their review. At the end of the fifteen (15) day review period, the application will either receive approval, or the applicant will be notified if additional information is needed.

3.271.1 - Estate residential. 
The purpose of this district is to provide an area for low density development of neighborhoods and subdivision development of exclusively residential land uses. The development area is concentrated to the north, northeast, and southwest of Thomasville. Significant development pressure in these areas is due to the availability of city water and some sewageable areas. New and infill development in the estate residential must be carefully regulated with design of streets, infrastructure, buffering, landscaping and connectivity of neighborhoods to create and maintain a sense of place. 
Permitted uses within any estate residential area the following development uses may be permitted: 
R-1 
R-2 
R-3 
R-87 
Conservation subdivision 
SFR individual lot 
(A)  R-1 Residential , Single-family—Low density residential one (1) acre is intended to provide for single-family site built conventional detached residential dwellings on individual lots at a low density development consistent with the use of private community wells, DNR approved wells, and septic tanks or on-site waste water treatment facilities. 
(B)  R-2 Residential , Single-family—Medium density residential one-half (½) of an acre, twenty-one thousand seven hundred eighty (21,780) square feet. This district is intended to provide for single site built conventional family dwellings on individual lots at a moderate density of development, consistent with the use of either community water systems or community sewage on-site disposal systems or both. 
(C)  R-3 Residential , Single-family—This district is intended to provide for single-family manufactured home subdivision developments of low density or medium density. 
Low density (one (1) acre) development shall be consistent with the use of private community wells, DNR approved wells, septic tanks or on-site wastewater treatment facilities. 
Medium density (one-half (½) of an acre, twenty-one thousand seven hundred eighty (21,780) square feet) subdivision development shall be consistent with the use of either community water systems or community sewage disposal systems or both. 
Manufactured homes, modular homes, and site built conventional single-family dwellings are permitted in a R-3 subdivision: 
Manufactured homes shall be designed and installed to give the appearance of a single-family conventional dwelling. The appearance would ordinarily include: 
•Permanent masonry foundation 
•Pitched shingle roof 
•Porches at exterior doors 
•A floor space commensurate with adjacent dwellings located within the district 
•Exterior appearance of wood, vinyl, masonry or fiber board siding 
(D)  R-87 Low density —Subdivisions of single-family detached conventional built homes are intended to provide for residential development at a very low density that are expected to become more urban in character in future years. These areas involved are generally in transition from agriculture to residential and would be considered appropriate for low density residential development. The district is characterized by very low density of housing and large lots sizes as well as uses associated with rural agriculture areas. Large lots sizes are permissible. The low densities are permitted in this subdivision generally permits on-site septic systems and private wells. 
(E)  Conservation subdivision developments —Thirty-five (35) acre minimum parcel size with development of fifty (50) percent of open space. (See design and development rules and regulations for conservation subdivision in the Thomas County Subdivision Ordinance.) 
This type of development will maintain a rural atmosphere while allowing new residential development design as "conservation subdivision" that incorporates significant amounts of open space and protects the sensitive land areas. Architectual styles are encouraged so as to maintain the regional rural character of Thomas County. "Franchise" or "corporate" architecture should not be included. 
Cluster design with smaller lot sizes are typical designs. 
(F)  Single-family detached residential individual lots (one (1) unit/two (2) acres minimum.) 
The single-family detached residential lot encourages low density development in the estate residential boundaries. The low densities permitted in this district generally permit onsite septic systems and private wells when public water and public sewer is not available. 
(G)  Schools, colleges, and publicly owned and operated community structures. 
(H)  Public utility structures buildings and land. 
(I)  Accessory uses of storage buildings. 
(J)  Churches and similar places of worship.

3.271.7 - Planned developments. 
•Conservation subdivision 
•Planned district (commercial)-PD 
•TND development 
•PUD 
The standards and requirements for all above planned developments provides for flexibility of design in order to promote efficient use of land and protect environmentally sensitive resources on the parcel. 
These developments are alternatives to conventional subdivisions and may require specific procedures for application review, zoning, natural features inventory survey, open space, and infrastructure requirements for public water and public sewer. 
The goal for Planned Developments shall be to maintain compatibility with nearby development and consistency with the future land use element of the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan by allowing the design of developments that are architecturally and environmentally innovative for efficient land use. 
CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION 
Purpose. 
It is the purpose of this ordinance to provide flexibility in ensuring preservation of green space within a master-planned residential development. A conservation subdivision design preserves green space while maintaining the prorated density of residential units for the overall site area. Neutral density is achieved by allowing smaller individual owned residential lots in neighbor-hoods that include or are adjacent to aesthetically and ecologically important areas. The goal of the design process is to identify and set aside conservation areas prior to the delineation of transportation and residential pod layouts. Green space areas include wetlands, stream buffer zones, woodlands, playing fields, and meadows, depending on the resources of the land. 
The purpose of conservation subdivision design is to: 
A.  Encourage development that permanently conserves natural resources such as wetlands, floodplains, streams, groundwater; forests and steep slopes; scenic roads and scenic views; archaeological and historical resources, while still allowing density neutral residential development in urban-rural transition zones; 
B.  Allow for greater flexibility and creativity in the design of residential developments; 
C.  Encourage compact, efficient development practices that consume less land and provide for the efficient use of infrastructure; 
D.  Encourage development practices that protect local topography by conforming the development to the landscape rather than the landscape to the development, thereby reducing land clearing costs and minimizing erosion and sedimentation; 
E.  Provide for a greater range of development types in the community; 
F.  Further community goals for protecting open space and greenways by means other than fee simple acquisition; 
G.  Provide opportunities for compatible agricultural activities adjacent to residential uses; and 
H.  Encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging the use of parks, open spaces, and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood. 
Definitions —For the purpose of these regulations the following terms, whenever used in these regulations, shall have the meaning indicated for the Conservation Subdivisions: 
(1)  Cluster development: A form of residential development that concentrates buildings or lots on a part of the site to allow the remaining land to be used for common open space, recreations, and preservation of environmentally sensitive features. The concentration of lots is facilitated by a reduction in lot size. A cluster development will consist of one (1) or more cluster groups surrounded by common open space. 
(2)  Common facilities: All the real property and improvements set aside for the common use and enjoyment of the residents of a cluster development, including, but not limited to, buildings, open space, private streets, parking areas, walkways, recreation areas, drainage easements, and any utilities that service more than one (1) unit, such as sewerage and water supply facilities. 
(3)  Conservation easement: The grant of a property right of interest from the property owner to another person, agency, unit of government, or organization stipulating that the described land shall remain in its natural, scenic, open, or wooded state, precluding future or additional development. 
(4)  Deed restriction: A restriction on the use of a property set forth in the deed. 
(5)  Density neutral: Density neutral means that the number of units allowed in a conservation subdivision design shall be equal to the number of units allowed using a conventional subdivision design. 
(6)  Farmstead: A group of existing buildings with accessory structures used for agricultural purposes, such as barns, silos, and storage sheds. 
(7)  Floodplains: Those lands, including the floodplain, flood fringe, floodway, and channel, subject to inundation by the 100-year recurrence interval flood or, where such data are not available, the maximum flood of record. 
(8)  Homeowners' Association: An association combining individual home ownership with shared use, ownership, maintenance, and responsibility for common property or facilities, including private open space, within a cluster development. 
(9)  Housing density determination: Process of determining the maximum number of units that can be developed in a conservation subdivision. 
(10)  Nonprofit conservation organization: A nonprofit corporation, charitable trust, or other nonprofit organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which includes the "acquisition of property or rights in property for conservation purposes" as part of its mission, as reflected in the bylaws, charter, or incorporation papers of the organization. 
(11)  Open space: Open space is the portion of the conservation subdivision that has been set aside for permanent protection. Activities within the open space are restricted in perpetuity through the use of an approved legal instrument. 
(12)  Preliminary conceptual site plan: This plan shows the primary and secondary conservation features as well as the tentative location of houses, lots, and streets. 
(13)  Site map: A map showing the locations of the primary and secondary conservation features as well as water features, soils, topography, vegetation, planned open space, and roads. 
General regulations. 
A.  Applicability of regulations. In order to achieve these purposes, the conservation subdivision design is available as a use by right in the following district boundaries: 
1.  Ag district. 
2.  Ag conservation. 
3.  Rural residential. 
4.  Estate residential. 
5.  Suburban residential. 
(1)  Conservation subdivisions are most appropriate near urban-rural transitional areas where densities are lower. 
(2)  The following classifications of a minor or major conservation subdivisions relate to the minimum acres required for development in the following district boundaries: 

 
(3)  Conservation subdivision in Ag districts. The Ag-Agricultural zoning district permits a wide array of uses, some of which may conflict with the enjoyment of one's property as a residential use. The Board of Commissioners may approve a site plan for a conservation subdivision on property zoned Ag upon finding the proposed subdivision is compatible or may be consistent with development surrounding the proposed subdivision. The regulations in this chapter shall be applicable upon approval of the site plan by the Board of Commissioners. 
(4)  Off-lot individually-owned septic facilities. When permitted by the Health Department, components of an individually-owned wastewater treatment facility may be located on suitable soil in the open space when such land is secured by easement. Land under easement in the open space used for this purpose may be included by applicant toward meeting minimum lot size requirements of the Health Department; and the total land area of the house lot and off-lot easement must equal or exceed the minimum lot size specified by the Health Department. The easement shall be fully described on the subdivision plat, and clearly marked by iron pins or signs placed by a registered surveyor from commencement of construction until occupancy of the corresponding house. 
Public maintenance of community or individually-owned off-lot wastewater facilities. 
With permission of the Health Department, Planning Director, and Public Works Director, easements may be accepted for maintenance of community waste water facilities or individually owned off-lot waste water treatment facilities. 
B.  Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be designed as a conservation subdivision may be held in single and separate ownership or in a multiple ownership. However when a tract is held in multiple ownership, it shall be planned as a single entity, and developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility. 
1.  Phased development: Unless approved under a concept/preliminary plan as outlined herein, each phase of a conservation subdivision must meet the density criteria established herein. 
2.  Proof of ownership: The developer of a conservation subdivision must provide documentation of ownership of all land to be planned as a conservation subdivision prior to approval of a land disturbance permit for the development. The only lands that may be considered for development as a conservation subdivision are those lands owned by the applicant for the land disturbance permit. 
C.  Site suitability. As evidenced by the existing resources or NFI survey, the conservation subdivision concept/preliminary plan, and the final plat, the tract incorporating the conservation subdivision design shall be suitable for supporting development in terms of environmental conditions, its size and its configuration. 
D.  Sensitive area disturbance. The proposed design shall strictly minimize disturbance of environmentally sensitive areas, as shown on the NFI survey. Lands within the 100-year floodplain, designated as wetlands, having slopes in excess of twenty-five (25) percent, and riparian buffers adjacent to streams constitute such environmentally sensitive area, where disturbance shall be strictly minimized. Demonstration by the applicant that these features shall be protected by the proposed application shall be prerequisite to approval of the conservation subdivision concept/preliminary plan and subsequent final plat. 
E.  Minor and major subdivisions number of lots. Minor subdivisions, defined in the Thomas County Development Ordinance as "a subdivision of land which results in the creation of two (2) or more lots and does not result in the creation of any public or private streets", are not eligible to be developed under the conservation regulations contained herein. Only those subdivisions, creating eight (8) or more lots are permissible to be developed as a conservation subdivision. 
F.  Effect of concept/preliminary plan. The approved concept/preliminary plan shall bind all land within the plan to the requirements and conditions of the conservation subdivision regulations. Should the developer or land owner subsequently sell or otherwise transfer their interest in the property, all heirs and assigns shall be bound to the approved concept/preliminary plan, unless amended by and/or approved by the Board of Commissioners. 
1.  Deed restriction required: Upon approval of the concept/preliminary plan for the entire property being developed as a conservation subdivision, the applicant shall present a covenant to be recorded with the deed for all property within the concept/preliminary plan. Such covenant shall bind all land within the concept/preliminary plan to said plan and shall not expire unless or until such plan is amended and approved by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners. 
Use regulations. 
Land planned as a conservation subdivision may be used for the following purposes: 
A.  Single-family detached dwellings; 
B.  Conservation areas as specified herein; 
C.  The following nonresidential use in accordance with standards specified in this article [section]: 
1.  Agricultural uses, including horticultural, wholesale nurseries, and the raising of crops, and building related to the same. 
2.  Woodlots, arboreta, and other sivicultural uses. 
3.  Woodland preserve, game preserve, wildlife sanctuary, or other similar conservation use. 
4.  Municipal or public uses; public park or recreation area owned and operated by a public or private nonprofit agency; governmental or public utility building or use. 
D.  Accessory uses shall be permitted on the same lot with and customarily incidental to any permitted use and not conducted as an independent principal use. Accessory dwelling units containing no less than four hundred (400) square feet and no more than eight hundred (800) square feet. 
E.  Conditional uses—Deemed as appropriate by PLUS commission and Thomas County Board of Commissioners. 
Dimensional standards and density determination. 
Density neutral. The number of lots created shall be density neutral. "Density neutral" is defined as maintaining the number of lots so as not to exceed the number that can be created with the conventional minimum area requirements of the zoning district designation of the subject property (Table 1). 
CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION DENSITY AND LOT SIZE REQUIREMENTS 
TABLE 1 

 
*With central sewer and public water. 
**Subject to DNR water system and onsite waste water treatment system or septic tanks in the common areas. 
Minimum lot size: Clustering of home on lots that are smaller than conventional development is the key to conserving the natural features and creating open space. 
Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in a conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two (2) methods, at the discretion of the applicant: 
A.  Calculation method: The maximum number of lots is determined by multiplying the net tract acreage by the maximum density units/acre factor (see Table 1) specified in the underlying zoning. The net tract acreage is calculated as outlined below: 
Step 1.  Calculation of the constrained lands: 
Total area of land in items a.—d. below multiplied by one-half (½). 
a.  Slopes over twenty-five (25) percent of at least five thousand (5,000) square feet contiguous area. 
b.  The 100-year floodplain. 
c.  Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act. 
d.  Area of land in stream buffers as required by federal, state or local regulations. 
Total area of land in items e. and f. below: 
e.  Area of land designated for construction of roads and associated ROW. 
f.  Area of all impervious surfaces associated with amenities, including but not limited to parking areas, tennis courts, swimming pools, clubhouses and other constrained Lands = (total area of land in items a.—d. times one-half (½) + total area of land in items e. and f. 
Step 2.  Net tract acreage. Once the area of constrained lands has been calculated, the net tract acreage is calculated by subtracting the acreage of constrained lands from the gross tract acreage of the property to be development as a conservation subdivision. 
B.  Yield plan method: The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all local, state and federal applicable regulations. Such yield plan shall be reviewed by the appropriate County staff to verify such plan meets the minimum criteria for development as proposed. 
Where the number of lots allowed under the yield plan method results in more lots than the number of lots under the calculation method, the lot size may be reduced by fifty (50) percent of the permissible lot size in Table 1 to accommodate the difference in the number of lots between the two (2) methods. Where on-site sewage management systems are to be used, the size of the lots shall be no less than that required by the Health Department. 
Area and Yard Requirements; Locations and Structures. 
Placement. The placement of all principal buildings shall provide for safe, quiet, and harmonious grouping as well as adequate privacy by providing adequate front, side, and rear yards. 
Location. Structures shall be placed so as to fulfill the objectives of, purposes of this ordinance, and to minimize any adverse effect on the environment and to take advantage of ecological conditions.

**Subject to DNR water system and onsite waste water treatment system or septic tanks in the common areas. 
Subdivision Design Standards. 
A.  House lots shall not encroach upon primary conservation areas, and their layout shall respect secondary conservation areas, as described herein. 
B.  All new dwellings shall meet the following building setback requirements: 
1.  From all external roads right-of-way ..... 100 feet 
2.  From all other tract boundaries ..... 75 feet  (40-foot buffer + 35 feet) 
3.  From all cropland or pasture land ..... 100 feet 
A.  Cropland shall be defined as; tracts of land of five (5) acres or greater, which is used for growing cultivated plants or agricultural produce, such as grain, vegetables, or fruit; or which could be fallow, if such inactivity is a part of the agricultural production process being exercised on the land and such inactivity has not existed for more than two (2) years. Such use of land must be present and active. Potential use of land as cropland does not qualify under this definition. 
B.  Pasture land shall be defined as tracts of land of five (5) acres or greater, on which grass or other vegetation is grown and eaten as food, and is set aside for use by domestic grazing animals. Such use of land must be present and active. Potential use of land as pasture does not qualify under this definition. 
4.  From buildings or barnyards housing livestock: Two hundred (200) feet or per Health Department requirements. 
5.  From active recreation areas, such as courts or ball fields (not including playgrounds, tot lots or open multi-purpose fields): One hundred fifty (150) feet. 
a.  Views of house lots from exterior road and abutting properties shall be minimized by the use of changes in topography, existing vegetation, or additional landscaping that meets landscaping requirements of the Land Use Standards Ordinance or buffer requirements of Thomas County. 
b.  House lots shall generally be accessed from interior streets rather than from roads bordering the tract. 
c.  At least three quarters (three-fourths (¾) or seventy-five (75) percent) of the lots should directly face, abut or be across the street from conservation land. 
Green Space. 
"Green space" is defined as the undeveloped land resulting from reductions in the minimum size of lots set aside as permanently protected land which may be for common use by the residents of the subdivision, or other uses as permitted in this ordinance. 
Standards to determine green space. 
A.  The minimum restricted green space shall comprise at least fifty (50) percent of the gross tract area. 
B.  At least twenty-five (25) percent of the green space shall consist of land that is suitable for building. 
C.  At least seventy-five (75) percent of the green space should be in a contiguous tract. The green space should adjoin any neighboring areas of green space, other protected areas, and nonprotected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected green space. 
Primary conservation areas. The following lands are considered to constitute lands that serve important ecological purposes and possess beneficial environmental qualities contributing to the health of the local community. Such areas shall be identified and protected as primary conservation areas. All land identified as primary conservation areas shall be undisturbed. 
1.  The 100-year floodplain. 
2.  Riparian zones of at least fifty (50) feet in width on either side along all perennial and intermittent streams. 
3.  Riparian zones of at least one hundred fifty (150) feet in width on either side.

5.  Wetlands that meet the definition used by state and/or federal regulations. 
6.  Populations of endangered or threatened species, or habitat for such species. 
Value of primary conservation areas. Primary conservation areas form the core of the green space to be protected. Because primary conservation areas are sensitive environmental areas, Thomas County prefers such areas be permanently protected through the thoughtful design and protection instruments outlined herein. The total area of land identified as primary conservation areas shall be conserved and protected to the maximum amount and extent physically possible. 
Secondary conservation areas. The following are considered secondary conservation areas and should be protected to the maximum extent feasible: 
1.  Important historic sites subject to approval indicating that these structures are compatible with the Thomas County Zoning Regulations. 
2.  Existing healthy, native forests of at least one (1) acre contiguous area. 
3.  Individual existing healthy trees greater than fourteen (14) inches caliper measured at dbh. 
4.  Other significant natural features and scenic view sheds such as ridge lines, hills, tree canopies, and valleys, particularly those that can be seen from public roads. 
5.  Prime agricultural lands of at least five (5) acres contiguous area. 
6.  Existing trails that connect the tract to neighboring areas. 
7.  Archaeological sites, cemeteries and burial grounds subject to approval indicating that these structures are compatible with the Thomas County Zoning Regulations. 
8.  Buffers as outlined in Table 3 minimum exterior boundary buffer in this ordinance. 
Value of secondary conservation areas. Secondary conservation areas are those areas within a property which contain other intrinsic qualities of value to the community. Also, secondary conservation areas are valued as supplemental area to the total conservation area of a conservation subdivision. To that end, Thomas County would prefer secondary conservation areas to be protected to the maximum extent possible after all identified primary conservation areas have been protected. 
Conservation areas, general recommendations. 
A.  Conservation areas should include the most sensitive resource areas of a property. 
B.  Fragmentation of conservation land should be minimized so that resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development. 
C.  Conservation areas should be designed as a part of larger continuous and integrated green space. 
D.  The conservation areas (primary and secondary) shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Nonadjoining lots shall be provided with safe, convenient access to the conservation areas. 
Permitted uses of green space. Uses of green space may include the following:

Such intrusions shall not be allowed to encroach into an exterior buffer as outlined herein. 
Prohibited uses of green space. Uses of green space may not include the following: 
1.  Roads, parking lots and impervious surfaces, except as specifically authorized in the previous sections. 
2.  Agricultural and forestry activities not conducted according to accepted best management practices. 
3.  Other activities as determined by the applicant and recorded on the legal instrument providing for permanent protection. 
4.  Golf courses. 
Ownership, preservation, and maintenance of green space. Green space land shall be preserved and maintained solely for the purposes specified in this ordinance. The method for effectuating such preservation and maintenance may be one (1) of the following: 
A.  Establishment of a mandatory homeowners' association to own and maintain the land in common for the green space purposes intended according to the following provisions: 
a.  With their application for a permit to develop a conservation subdivision, developers will create and submit documentation detailing the minimum requirements and structure for the homeowners' association before the first lot is sold. 
b.  The homeowners' association will maintain, pay taxes, and own the green space. 
c.  Membership in the homeowners' association is mandatory for all homeowners, and dues are uniform.

A.  A permanent conservation easement in favor of either: 
1.  A land trust or similar conservation-oriented nonprofit organization with legal authority to accept such easements. The organization shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the conveyance instruments shall contain an appropriate provision for re-transfer in the event the organization becomes unable to carry out its functions; or 
2.  A governmental entity with an interest in pursuing goals compatible with the "purposes" of this ordinance. 
B.  A permanent restrictive covenant for conservation purposes in favor of a governmental entity. The covenant must include "use for the public good" language. The instrument for permanent protection: 
1.  Shall be placed on the green space concurrent with the issuance of a land disturbance permit.

8.  Will provide that such instrument may not be altered, modified, or amended. 
C.  All legal instruments used to permanently protect conservation areas platted within the conservation subdivision shall be executed by the developer and approved by the County Attorney prior to approval of the final plat for the development. Upon approval of the final plat and the legal instruments for permanent protection of the conservation areas, the County may record said documents with the Clerk of the Court's office. All fees associated with the recordation of plats and legal instruments will be furnished by the developer of the conservation subdivision or their agent. 
Procedure. 
Pre-application meeting (first meeting). 
A pre-application meeting is required between the applicant, the site designer and the Planning Staff where the site designer has not submitted a conservation subdivision designed under these regulations prior to the effective date. Subsequent pre-application meetings are recommended but are at the discretion of the site designer. The purpose of the pre-application meeting is to introduce the applicant to the County's zoning, subdivision regulations, and procedures; to discuss the applicant's objectives and to schedule site inspections; set up additional meetings, and plan submissions. Applicants are encouraged to present the NFI survey at this meeting. 
Existing resources Natural Features Inventory (second meeting). 
The purpose of this key submission is to familiarize County Staff and Officials with existing and factual reference in making a site inspection. This plan shall be provided prior to the site inspection and shall form the basis for the development design as shown on the conceptual preliminary plan. The applicant shall present the Natural Features Inventory survey, which is to ensure that the important site features have been adequately identified prior to the creation of the site design, and that the proposed green space will meet the requirements of this article. 
The existing NFI survey forms shall include the following features: (The NFI short or long forms are available at the Planning Department.) 
•Property boundaries. 
•All streams (perennial and intermittent), rivers, lakes, wetlands and other hydrologic features. 
•Topographic contours of no less than ten-foot intervals. 
•All primary and secondary conservation areas labeled by type, as described in this article [section]. 
•Vegetation characteristics. 
•Groundwater recharge areas. 
•Significant wildlife habitats, if known. 
•Historic, archeological and cultural features. 
•General soil types. 
•The planned location of protected green space. 
•Existing roads and structures. 
•Potential connections with existing green space and trails. 
•Identification of surrounding property type/land use. 
Review of existing resources. The existing resources map shall be reviewed by the Planning Director or his/her designee. If found inadequate by the reviewer, the reviewer shall state the reasons for its inadequacy, and the existing resources map shall not be accepted until adequate changes are made. 
Site inspection (third meeting). 
After preparing the existing resources survey or NFI, applicants may arrange for a site inspection of the property by the Planning Staff and shall distribute copies of such site analysis plan at this on-site meeting. The purpose of the site visit is to familiarize the staff with the property's existing conditions and special features, to identify potential site design issues, and to provide an informal opportunity to discuss site design concepts, including the general layout of the designated green space lands and potential locations for proposed buildings and street alignments. Comments made by the staff and consultants shall be interpreted as being only suggestive. It shall be understood by all parties that no formal recommendations can be offered, and no official decisions can be made at the site inspection. 
Sketch plan submission (may be submitted at site inspection meeting). 
Purpose. At the discretion of the applicant, a sketch plan may be submitted as a diagrammatic basis for informal discussion with the staff regarding the design of a proposed subdivision or land development. The purpose of a sketch plan submission is to provide a mechanism to help applicants and the staff develop a better understanding of the property and to help establish an overall design approach that respects its special or noteworthy features while providing for the density permitted under the Zoning Ordinance. 
Required information. To provide a full understanding of the site's potential and to facilitate the most effective exchange with the Planning Staff, the sketch plan shall include the information listed below. Many of these items can be taken from the NFI survey and in fact the diagrammatic sketch plan may be prepared as a simple overlay sheet placed on top of a tax map or aerial map. 
1.  Name and address of the legal owner, the equitable owner, and/or the applicant; 
2.  Name and address of the professional engineer, surveyor, planner, architect, landscape architect, or the site designer responsible for preparing the plan; 
3.  Graphic scale (not greater than one (1) inch = two hundred (200) feet, however, dimensions on plan need not be exact) and north arrow; 
4.  Approximate tract boundaries, sufficient to locate the tract on a map of the community; 
5.  Location map; 
6.  Zoning district; 
7.  Streets on and adjacent to the tract (both existing and proposed); 
8.  One hundred-year floodplain limits, and approximate location of wetlands, if any; 
9.  Topographic, physical and cultural features including fields, pastures, meadows, wooded areas, trees with a diameter of fourteen (14) inches or more, hedgerows and other significant vegetation, steep slopes (greater than twenty-five (25) percent), soil types, ponds, ditches, drains, dumps, storage tanks, streams within two hundred (200) feet of tract, existing right-of-way and easements, and cultural features such as all structures, foundations, walls, wells, trails, and abandoned roads; 
10.  Schematic layout indicating a general concept for land conservation and development. 
11.  Proposed general street and lot layout; 
12.  In the case of land development plans, proposed location of buildings and major structures, parking areas and other improvements; and 
13.  General description of proposed method of water supply, sewage disposal, and stormwater management. 
Concept/preliminary plan (fourth meeting). 
The concept/preliminary plan shall follow the process and procedure outlined in the Thomas County Subdivision Rules and Regulations for plan submittal. The plan shall be reviewed by staff at regular scheduled Technical Review Committee meetings. 
Four-step subdivision design process. 
All concept/preliminary plans for conservation subdivisions shall include documentation of a four step design process in determining the layout of proposed green space lands, house sites, streets and lot lines as described below. 
A.  Step 1: Delineation of green space lands. 
1.  The minimum percentage and acreage of required green space lands shall be calculated by the applicant and submitted as part of the sketch plan or conceptual design plan in accordance with this ordinance. Green space lands shall include all primary conservation areas and those parts of the secondary conservation areas to meet the terms of this ordinance. 
2.  Proposed green space lands shall be designated using the engineer's calculations as a base map. 
3.  In delineating secondary conservation areas, the applicant shall consult with the Planning Staff on the prioritization of natural and cultural resources on the tract in terms of their highest to least suitability for inclusion in the proposed green space. 
4.  On the basis of those priorities and practical considerations given to the tract's configuration, its context in relation to resource areas on adjoining and neighboring properties, and the applicants subdivision objectives, secondary conservation areas shall be delineated to meet at least the minimum area percentage requirements for green space lands and in a manner clearly indicating their boundaries as well as the types of resources included within them. 
B.  Step 2: Location of house sites. 
Potential house sites shall be tentatively located using the proposed green space lands as a base map as well as other relevant data on the resource maps such as topography and soils. Home sites should generally be located not closer than one hundred (100) feet from primary conservation areas and fifty (50) feet from secondary conservation areas, taking into consideration the potential negative impacts of residential development on such areas as well as the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and visual settings for residences. 
C.  Step 3: Alignment of streets and trails. 
Upon designating the house sites, a street plan shall be designed to provide vehicular access to each house, which complies with the standards for road design in the Thomas County Subdivision Regulations and bears a logical relationship to topographic conditions. Impacts of the street plan on proposed green space lands shall be minimized, particularly with respect to crossing environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and traversing steep slopes. Street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new cul-de-sacs and to facilitate access to and from homes in different parts of the tract and adjoining parcels. 
D.  Step 4: Drawing in the lot lines. 
Upon completion of the preceding three (3) steps, lot lines are drawn as required to delineate the boundaries of individual residential lots. Lot lines are drawn as the last step. 
E.  Additional design considerations: 
1.  Additional minimum acreage requirements for green space areas consist of secondary conservation areas. 
2.  Total green space area requirements are the sum of primary and secondary conservation areas. 
3.  The locations and boundaries of primary conservation. 
4.  The locations and boundaries of secondary conservation. 
5.  Development areas constitute the remaining lands of the tract outside the designated green space areas. 
Road specification. 
Roads for the conservation subdivision shall follow road construction guidelines consistent with those set forth in the Thomas County Subdivision Regulations. The design of streets within the conservation subdivision, and where possible and with the approval of the County Public Works Director, should seek to: 
1.  Minimize the number of cul-de-sac streets by providing more than one (1) entrance to the development and interconnect streets as much as possible. 
2.  For cul-de-sac streets, minimize the amount of impervious surface by limiting the internal turning radius to thirty-five (35) feet and the width of the paved lane to twenty (20) feet. Use grass and vegetation for the inner circle of turn-a-rounds, rather than paving the entire area. Declare the HOA responsible for the maintenance of the grassy area in the neighborhood bylaws. 
3.  Omit curbs wherever appropriate. 
4.  As an alternative to curbs and gutters, allow runoff from roofs and pavements to pass immediately through grass swales or infiltration basins. Use plant material that will absorb rainwater and act as a natural filter for oil and pollution. 
5.  Provide paths for nonvehicular traffic within the development and connecting to neighboring residential recreation areas. 
Buffer requirement. 
Where property to be developed as a conservation subdivision abuts property not a part of the conservation subdivision, the conservation subdivision shall have a buffer along the exterior property boundary. The buffer shall be undisturbed except as specifically allowed herein, and of sufficient volume to provide a year-round opaque screening. Where no vegetation exists within the required buffer area, or where existing semi vegetation does not provide a sufficient screen, and where planting of native vegetation will provide screening, the buffer shall be planted with such vegetation to meet the intent of this section. 
A.  Mandatory stormwater structures. Where the only practical place upon the tract of land being developed as a conservation subdivision to locate a stormwater facility serving to contain and control the stormwater generated from the conservation subdivision is within the required buffer. The County Public Works Director may permit such a structure to be built within the required buffer. The area devoted to the installation of the stormwater structure may not be used to satisfy the green space requirement for the development. 
Where stormwater structures are allowed within the buffer, the developer shall plant sufficient vegetative material to effectively screen the location of such structure and obscure such structure from view. 
B.  Trails. Where trails are planned to be provided, such trails may be constructed within the buffer area. The path through the buffer area containing such trail may be no wider than eight (8) feet. All clearing associated with the construction of such path shall be contained within the eight (8) feet. If such trails are planned as a part of the development, the trails must be located within the first twenty-five (25) percent of the buffer furthest from the exterior boundary line for the subdivision but in no event shall be within thirty (30) feet of said exterior boundary line. 
Size of buffer. The size of the exterior buffer is determined by the size of the lot proposed adjacent to the exterior boundary for the conservation subdivision. (See Table 3, Minimum Exterior Boundary Buffer.) 
Buffer counts toward green space requirement. The area of land designated to the exterior boundary buffer may be used to satisfy the minimum required green space for the development. The buffer area shall not be included as a part of any platted residential lot within the subdivision. This buffer shall be considered a secondary conservation area unless a feature of the buffer qualifies as primary conservation area as defined herein. Such buffer shall be designated as part of the green space for the subdivision and be permanently protected in accordance with the requirements contained herein.

TABLE 3 

 
Planned Unit Development (PUD) 
A.  Purpose. 
The intent and purpose of the planned unit development (PUD) is to encourage creative and imaginative design for the development of residential and nonresidential areas that include compatible residential, commercial, office and related public facilities and provides a higher level of urban amenities. A PUD may be approved according to a site plan that ensures the more efficient use of land conservation of natural environment and efficient streets and utilities. 
This district is to be utilized as a floating zone which shall mean that areas will not be pre-designated as planned unit development districts, but rather each such designation shall result from a specific and separate application for amendment. Planned unit development districts are separate zoning districts and shall follow the same amendment procedure as other zoning districts. The development standards and land uses, if approved, shall become the standards for the property related to the zoning regulations. For purposes of zoning compliance, a PUD district property shall be treated as one (1) lot or parcel. 
B.  Objectives: 
The planned unit development district must provide the following, as appropriate: 
(1)  Mixture of uses: Accommodate a mixture of land uses which are compatible both internally and externally on the parcel. 
(2)  Ensure the conservation of natural resources, geological, and topographical features with emphasis upon: 
(a)  Conservation of existing surface and sub-surface water resources. 
(b)  Prevention of soil erosion on the property. 
(c)  Preserve large trees and natural vegetated areas. 
(d)  Efficient land use in design of streets and utilities within the PUD district and adequate utilities including public water, public sanitary sewer systems and stormwater facilities. 
(e)  Developing open space for recreation or wildlife. 
(3)  A preliminary development plan to convey the overall concept and to guide and coordinate any phased development and a final development plan which meets all of the pre-approved regulations. 
(4)  The PUD developments may be located only within the suburban residential boundaries and have access to minor arterial or minor collector roads or streets. 
C.  Type of planned unit development and permitted uses: 
The following types of planned unit developments are authorized by these regulations: 
(1)  a.  Residential uses only (single-family except manufactured homes). 
b.  Residential with other uses (mixed). 
Other uses: Public buildings, including churches and other places of worship, and recreation facilities for use of the residents of the PUD [and also their guests]. The restrictions as to the use of these facilities shall be set forth in covenants for the residential district. 
The following minimum requirements shall be required: 
Adequate public water and public sewer service or facilities shall be required for all development in a PUD. 
Minimum land area for development is fifteen (15) acres. 
Residential: (Sixty-five (65) percent). 
Open space: (Fifteen (15) percent). 
Recreation, civic or public buildings: (Twenty (20) percent). 
The following uses may be permitted within a PUD district if in conformance with specific and precise preliminary and final development plans or phases as set forth in this ordinance: 
1.  Residential uses: Residences may be a variety of housing types and ownership types as follows: single-family detached, attached single-family, duplex (two-family), multifamily, townhouse, patio homes, zero (0) lot line design homes, condominiums, and apartments. The density for multifamily or apartment shall not exceed eleven (11) units per acre. 
2.  Community center, meeting facilities, indoor or outdoor recreation facilities and spaces are permitted when limited to use by the residents of the PUD through recorded covenants and restrictions. 
3.  Commercial and office uses: 
Office uses shall include those permitted in the commercial limited districts. Office development shall be designed with respect to intensity, location and use so as to primarily serve the residents of the PUD. All business or office uses shall be landscaped and buffered from residential uses. Office uses would be considered an office park development in the PUD. 
Commercial uses shall include those uses allowed in "planned shopping centers" and "planned service centers". Such uses shall be designed with respect to their nature, development intensity and location so as to primarily serve the residents of the PUD. 
Commercial development shall be landscaped and meet buffer requirements in a manner to screen the commercial development from residential development in the PUD. All interior streets or roads in this district shall be curb and gutter. 
The development design for streets and roads shall not route through residential areas within or adjacent to the PUD parcel. 
4.  Public uses. 
Other uses such as public buildings, civic use, churches and recreation facilities are permitted. 
These developments shall be centrally located within the PUD to ensure adequate areas by residents and users. 
Pedestrian and bicycle paths shall be provided to connect civic and public uses to residential areas. 
Adequate public water and public sewer service or facilities shall be required for all development in a PUD. 
The minimum acreage for a mixed PUD of residential, commercial/office uses (office park) or planned shopping center shall be twenty-five (25) acres. 
Provisions for the permanent ownership, operation and maintenance of common space shall be provided by covenant, deed restriction easement or ownership by and for the benefit of a property owners' association, land trust or other legal authority. 
D.  Site plan requirements: 
(1)  Pre-application meeting: Refer to page 86 [of this ordinance] (procedural and regulatory provisions [subsection F. of this section]). 
(2)  The PUD district shall require a site plan to accompany the application for the rezoning. (The submittal and content requirements for the site plan are found in the Thomas County Subdivision Rules and Regulations under planned unit development (PUD). 
(3)  Upon successful approval of the rezoning to the PUD district, the site plan design shall be binding on all future development and use in the development. 
E.  Additional standards applying to planned unit development. The following dimensional requirements and density for lots in a planned unit development are as follows: 
(1)  Minimum lot width at building setback line. 
a.  Sixty (60) feet for detached single-family. 
b.  Twenty-four (24) feet for attached fee simple townhouse and condominium lots. 
c.  One hundred twenty (120) feet for multifamily and office/civic lots. 
d.  One hundred twenty (120) feet for "commercial center" lots. 
(2)  Minimum front yard depth from right-of-way of streets.

(1)  Consistency with local ordinances and comprehensive plan. The proposed conditional use is in compliance with all requirements, and is consistent with the general purpose, goals, objectives and standards, of this ordinance, the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan, and the Code of Ordinances of Thomas County; and is in compliance with all additional standards imposed on it by the particular provisions of this ordinance authorizing such use. 
(2)  Effect on nearby properties. 
(a)  The proposed conditional use will not have an undue adverse effect upon adjacent or nearby property. 
(b)  The proposed conditional use is compatible with the existing or planned character of the neighborhood in which it would be located. 
(c)  All reasonable steps have been taken to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed conditional use on the immediate vicinity through building design, site design, landscaping, and screening. 
(d)  The proposed conditional use will be constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to interfere with the development and use of neighboring property, in accordance with applicable district regulations. 
(3)  Adequacy of public facilities. The proposed conditional use will be served by adequate public facilities and services including roads, police protection, fire protection, waste disposal, water, sewer, and drainage. 
(4)  Environmental impact. The proposed conditional use will not have a significantly adverse impact on the natural environment. 
4.313 - Conditions on conditional use permits. 
The Planning and Land Use Standards Commission may recommend and the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may attach such conditions, limitations, and requirements to a conditional use permit as are necessary to effectuate the purposes of Section 4.310; to carry out the spirit and purpose of this ordinance and the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan; and to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property in the neighborhood, including but not limited to limitations on size, intensity of use, bulk and location, landscaping, lighting, the provision of adequate ingress and egress, duration of the permit, and hours of operation. Such conditions shall be set forth expressly in the resolution granting the conditional use permit. 
(1)  Traffic control devices. Whenever, as the result of traffic generated by a proposed conditional use, it is determined, based on the manual on uniform traffic control devices, that there is a need to install traffic control devices (including traffic signals, signing, and pavement markings), the conditional use permit shall not be granted except upon the condition that the applicant be responsible for installing all said devices and signs, or make an equitable contribution toward such installation. 
(2)  Towers. 
1.  Definitions. As used in this ordinance, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
a.  Alternative tower structure shall mean manmade trees, clock towers, bell steeples, light poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers. 
b.  Antenna shall mean any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio, or television communications through the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves. 
c.  FAA shall mean the Federal Aviation Administration. 
d.  FCC shall mean the Federal Communications Commission. 
e.  Preexisting towers and antennas shall have the meaning set forth in subsection (2)2.d. of this section. 
f.  Height shall mean, when referring to a tower or other structure, the distance measured from ground level to the highest point on the tower or other structure, even if said highest point is an antenna. 
g.  Tower shall mean any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one (1) or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative tower structures, and the like. 
2.  Applicability. 
a.  District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this ordinance shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of, the height limitations specified for each zoning district. The height limitations applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to towers and antennas. 
b.  Public property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall be exempt from the requirements of this ordinance, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners. 
c.  Amateur radio; receive-only antennas. This ordinance shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna that is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive only antennas. 
d.  Pre-existing towers and antennas. All towers shall meet the requirements of subsection 4.D.3. of this section. 
3.  General guidelines and requirements. 
a.  Purpose; goals. The purpose of this ordinance is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this ordinance are to: (i) Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community, (ii) encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites, (iii) encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal, (iv) encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas, and (v) enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently. 
b.  Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
c.  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and or tower shall provide to the Planning and Zoning Department an inventory of existing towers that are either in the jurisdiction of the Thomas County Board of Commissioners or within one-quarter (¼) mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The Planning and Zoning Department may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals under this ordinance or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the Thomas County Board of Commissioners, provided, however that the Planning and Zoning Department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
d.  Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this subsection (3)d. shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this ordinance, provided, however, that the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this ordinance are better served thereby. 
1.  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
2.  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
3.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
4.  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required the Thomas County Board of Commissioners requires shielded dual mode lighting or focused lens-white during daytime hours and red at night. 
e.  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall be in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia. 
f.  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the Thomas County Board of Commissioners concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall be in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia. 
g.  Height requirements. No tower shall exceed a height of three hundred fifty feet (350) feet. 
h.  Setbacks. All towers shall be set back from any adjoining property line a distance of the tower height. 
i.  Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device, provided, however, that the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate. 
j.  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a special use permit is required, provided, however, that the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may waive such requirements if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby. 
1.  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four (4) feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. 
2.  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether. 
3.  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer. 
4.  Conditional uses. 
A.  General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of conditional use permits for towers: 
1.  In granting a conditional use permit, the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may impose conditions to the extent the Thomas County Board of Commissioners concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. 
2.  Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer. 
B.  Information required. Each applicant requesting a conditional use permit for towers under this ordinance shall submit the following: 
1.  Land use compliance form signed by owner of the property in order to alert to possible breech of covenant. 
2.  Authorization letter signed by owner and notarized granting permission to the agent. 
3.  Plat of property, and site plan showing approved drives, setbacks, and other Ordinance requirements. 
4.  Copy of lease agreement.

6.  FCC and FAA acknowledgment. 
7.  Inventory of existing tower sites. 
8.  Furnish letter of intent or written contract with carrier(s). 
9.  Application for conditional use must be submitted to Planning and Zoning Director. 
10.  Propagation coverage. 
C.  Technical information required after approval. Applicants approved for a conditional use permit for towers under this ordinance shall submit the following: 
1.  Site plan signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the scaled elevation view, latitude and longitude, and other supporting drawings, calculations and documentation, location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, approved drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, and adjacent uses. 
2.  Towers shall be designed to meet or exceed all current EIA/TIA 222-F Standards. 
D.  Additional procedures required. In addition to any application procedures specified in [section] 4.320 the following special procedures apply to tower applicants: 
1.  Pre-application conference. 
2.  Review by Thomas County Development Technical Review Committee. 
3.  All approved permits shall be required to file an annual report thirty (30) days prior to December 31 of each year showing proof of carriers located on such tower. 
4.  Applicant must show proof of carrier within twelve (12) months from the date of approval or permit will be revoked (See Section 4.370, Expiration of Conditional Use Permit, page 118 [of this ordinance.) 
5.  A performance bond for fifty (50) percent of the permitted value must be issued to Thomas County prior to a building permit being issued to cover the removal of abandoned antennas and towers. Bond will be reduced after the first twelve (12) months to the certified removal value which will include an annual three (3) percent inflation factor. 
6.  Towers will be considered abandoned if not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, and removal shall be the responsibility of the tower company. A penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day shall be imposed for each day in violation after notification. 
5.  Factors considered in granting conditional use permits. The Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special use permits, although the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one (1) or more of the criteria if the Thomas County Board of Commissioners, concludes that the goals of this ordinance are better served thereby. 
A.  Height of the proposed tower; 
B.  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
C.  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
D.  Surrounding topography; 
E.  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
F.  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; and 
G.  Proposed ingress and egress; and 
H.  Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in subsection 3.c. 
I.  Carrier utilization of tower(s). 
6.  Administrative. 
A.  General. 
(1)  Each applicant applying for a conditional use for towers shall adhere to application procedures as required in Section 4.320, Application Procedures, providing the information set forth in subsections 4.B. and 4.C. 
(2)  Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the Thomas County Board of Commissioners notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said ninety (90) days, the Thomas County Board of Commissioners may, in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia, remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two (2) or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower. 
(3)  Access improvements. A conditional use permit shall not be granted except upon the condition that the applicant provides the access (ingress and egress) improvements determined to be necessary as a result of traffic generated by the development. 
(4)  Projects requiring other regulatory approvals. For proposed conditional uses requiring any permit from any local state, or federal regulatory authority, the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall not grant unconditionally a conditional use permit until the commission has received from such authority notice of either issuance or of intent to issue the required regulatory permit. 
(5)  Conditional approval. The Thomas County Board of Commissioners may grant a conditional use permit contingent upon receiving notice of either issuance of or intent to issue any required regulatory permit if it can make, on a tentative basis and subject to confirmation, the findings required in Section 4.312. A conditional use permit granted contingent upon receiving notice of either issuance of or intent to issue any required regulatory permit shall not preclude the Planning and Land Use Standards Commission, after reviewing the regulatory permit application and other information, from revoking such contingent grant of a conditional use permit based solely upon an inability to confirm the findings required in Section 4.312 or from protesting the regulatory permit application. 
(6)  Reduction in maximum residential density. The Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall require a reduction from the maximum residential density permitted in the land use standards district in which a conditional use is to be located when such allowable maximum residential density would impose an excessive burden, as determined by recognized engineering or other professional standards, on public facilities that would serve the proposed conditional use. 
4.320 - Application procedures. 
4.321 - Pre-application conference. 
An application for conditional use is initiated by requesting in writing a pre-application conference with the Planning Director. The request shall include a description of the character, location, and magnitude of the proposed conditional use, together with a proposed timetable for development. The purpose of this meeting is to acquaint the applicant with the requirements of this ordinance and the views and concerns of the County when positions are flexible. Within twenty (20) days of the request, the Planning Director shall schedule a pre-application conference between himself, the applicant, and any other official of other relevant County departments. 
4.322 - Filing application for conditional use permit. 
(1)  Filing. After the pre-application conference, an applicant for a conditional use permit shall submit an application to the Planning Director accompanied by a nonrefundable fee as established from time to time by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners to defray the actual cost of processing the application.

The Planning Director shall take no further action on the application unless the deficiencies are remedied. 
(b)  When the Planning Director determines that an application for conditional use permit is complete, he shall review the application, make a report, and notify the Planning and Land Use Standards Commission that the application is ready to review. 
4.323 - Hearing and action by Planning and Land Use Standards Commission. 
(1)  Hearing. Upon notification that the application for a conditional use permit is ready for review, the Planning and Land Use Standards Commission shall place it on the agenda of a regularly scheduled meeting for public hearing in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.110. The public hearing held on the application for conditional use shall be in accordance with Section 4.120. 
(2)  Review. In reviewing the conditional use application, the Planning and Land Use Standards Commission shall consider the report of the Planning Director; shall determine whether the proposed use meets the standards in Section 4.312 for conditional uses; and, shall determine whether the proposed use meets all other provisions of this ordinance, the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan, and any other applicable County Ordinance. The Planning and Land Use Standards Commission may recommend certain conditions be met before approval of the application. 
4.330 - Development of an approved or existing conditional use. 
(1)  Effect of issuance of conditional use permit. The issuance of a conditional use permit shall only constitute approval of the proposed use, and development of the use shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other permits and approvals required. 
(2)  Inspections during development of an approved conditional use. 
(a)  Inspections by Planning Director. Following approval of a conditional use, the Planning Director may until the completion of development, review all permits issued and construction undertaken and compare actual development with the approved conditional use and with the approved development schedule, if applicable. 
(b)  Action by Planning Director. If the Planning Director finds that development is not proceeding in accordance with the approved schedule, or that it fails in any other respect to comply with the approved conditional use, he shall notify the Thomas County Board of Commissioners of such fact and may, if he finds it necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, or welfare, take such necessary action to stop such noncompliance. 
(c)  Action by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners. Within thirty (30) days following notification by the Planning Director, the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall determine whether development of the conditional use is proceeding in accordance with the approved conditional use. If the Thomas County Board of Commissioners finds the development is not proceeding in accordance with the approved conditional use, it shall either revoke the permit, or take the necessary action to compel compliance with the approved conditional use. 
(3)  Inspections after development. 
(a)  Inspection by Planning Director. Following completion of the development of a conditional use, the Planning Director shall review the development as completed and determine if it complies with the approved conditional use. 
(b)  Action by Planning Director. If the Planning Director finds that the development as completed fails in any respect to comply with the use as approved, he shall immediately notify the Thomas County Board of Commissioners of such fact. 
(c)  Action by Board of Commissioners. Within thirty (30) days following notification by the Planning Director, the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall determine whether the completed conditional use fails in any respect to follow the approved conditional use permit. If the Thomas County Board of Commissioners finds the completed conditional use fails in any respect to follow the approved conditional use, it shall either revoke the permit or take the necessary action to compel compliance with the approved conditional use. 
4.340 - Extensions of conditional use permits. 
The time limitations imposed on a conditional use permit by Section 4.370 may be extended by the Thomas County Board of Commissioners not more than one (1) time, and for not more than twenty-four (24) months, upon application by the applicant and after a public hearing held in accordance with Section 4.120. 
4.350 - Existing conditional uses. 
A legally conforming use that exists on the effective date of this ordinance and that is permitted as a conditional use in a land use standards district shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in that district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use. A use existing prior to its present classification by this ordinance as a conditional use may change in use or in lot area or may alter a structure only if the change or alteration conforms to the requirements of Section 4.330 for conditional uses. Such change or alteration may be accomplished only pursuant to the standards and procedures established for the adjustment of a conditional use as set forth in Section 4.330. 
4.360 - Revocation of conditional use permit. 
In addition to any other penalty and remedy for violation of this ordinance, it shall be a condition of every conditional use approval that such approval may be revoked for violation of any condition imposed upon such approval. The permit may be revoked only after the Thomas County Board of Commissioners holds a public hearing in accordance with Section 4.120. 
4.370 - Expiration of conditional use permit. 
A conditional use permit shall be valid for the purposes of securing a building permit or zoning compliance certificate for twelve (12) months from the date of approval. Unless a building permit or zoning compliance certificate is secured within twelve (12) months, and construction subsequently undertaken pursuant to such building permit, the conditional use permit shall automatically expire unless the permit is extended upon application to the Thomas County Board of Commissioners in accordance with Section 4.340. 
4.380 - Limitations on approval for conditional uses. 
A conditional use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which it was issued and shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such use shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months. 
Section 4.400 - Variances from land use standards district regulations. 
4.410 - General provisions. 
(1)  Authority . The Planning and Land Use Standards Commission shall recommend and the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall have authority to grant variances from the requirements of Sections 3.216 (except no variance shall be granted for residential or commercial construction on property that is located on an easement), and 3.222, and 3.223 in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in this section. 
(2)  Purpose . The purpose of a variance is to provide a mechanism when, owing to special conditions, the literal enforcement of the regulations of Sections 3.216, 3.222, and 3.223 that impose upon a landowner unnecessary hardship can be mitigated without conferring on the applicant any special privilege. 
(3)  Initiation . An owner of or any person having contractual interest in the property to be affected by the variance may seek a variance under the provisions of this section. 
(Amd. of 10-13-98; Res. of 4-24-18) 
4.420 - Standards for granting variances. 
The Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall not grant a variance unless it shall, in each case, make specific findings of fact based directly upon the particular evidence presented to it which support written conclusions that: 
(1)  The variance requested· arises from a condition that is unique and peculiar to the land, structures, and buildings involved; that the particular physical surroundings, the shape or topographical condition of the specific property involved, would result in unnecessary hardship for the owner, lessee, or occupant, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the provisions of Sections 3.216, 3.222, and 3.223 are literally enforced; that it is a condition that is not ordinarily found in the same land use standards district, and the condition is created by the regulations of Sections 3.216, 3.222, 3.223 of this ordinance, and not by an action or actions of the property owner or the applicant. 
(2)  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same land use standards district under the terms of this ordinance. 
(3)  The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the subject property is located, nor impair an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
(4)  The granting of the variance will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to similar lands, structures, or buildings in the same land use standards district. 
(5)  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structures; and 
(6)  The variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of this ordinance of the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan. 
(Amd. of 10-13-98; Res. of 4-24-18) 
4.430 - Limitations on variances. 
(1)  No variance shall be granted which would permit a use or structure contrary to the use provisions of Section 3.270.1 and Table 4. 
(2)  No variance from the provisions of Sections 3.216, 3.222, and 3.223 shall be valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months unless a building permit is issued and construction is started pursuant thereto. 
(Res. of 4-24-18) 
4.440 - Procedures for application. 
(1)  Application. An application for a variance shall be filed with the Planning Director accompanied by a nonrefundable fee, as established from time to time by the Board of Commissioners to defray the actual cost of processing the application. The application shall be in such form and shall contain such information and documentation as shall be prescribed from time to time by the Planning Director and shall contain at least the following: 
(a)  Name and address of applicant. 
(b)  Legal description, street address, and lot number and subdivision name, if any, of the property which is the subject of the application. 
(c)  The size of the subject property. 
(d)  The variance sought and the section of this ordinance from which a variance is requested. 
(e)  The purpose for the requested variance and a statement of the intended development of property if the variance is granted. 
(f)  A statement of the hardship imposed on the applicant by this ordinance; a statement setting forth reasons why this hardship is unique to the applicant, and why the same hardship is not imposed on other property in the neighborhood that is similarly situated; a statement of why the variance will not be materially detrimental or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the subject property is located; a statement of why the variance will not increase traffic, the danger of fire, or impair property values in the neighborhood; a statement of why the proposed variance is the minimum variance that will make possible a reasonable use of the land, building, and structures; and a statement explaining how the proposed variance is consistent with the general spirit and intent of this ordinance and the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan. 
(2)  Filing and application for approval of a variance. Within five (5) working days after an application for approval of a variance is submitted, the Planning Director shall determine whether the application is complete. If the Planning Director determines that the application is not complete, he shall send a written statement specifying the application's deficiencies to the applicant by mail. The Planning Director shall take no further action on the application unless the deficiencies are remedied. 
(3)  Review by the Planning Director. When the Planning Director determines an application for approval of a variance is complete, he shall review the application, make a recommendation, and submit it to the Planning and Land Use Standards Commission. 
4.450 - Action of Planning and Land Use Standards Commission and Thomas County Board of Commissioners. 
(1)  Upon notification that an application for a variance is complete, the Planning and Land Use Standards Commission and the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall place the application on the agenda of a regularly scheduled meeting for a public hearing in accordance with Section 4.100. In reviewing the application for variance approval, the Planning and Land Use Standards Commission and the Thomas County Board of Commissioners shall use the standards in Section 4.420. The Thomas County Board of Commissioners may require the applicant to meet certain conditions before approval of the variance. 
(2)  Within a reasonable time of the hearing, the Planning and Land Use Standards Commission shall make its recommendation to approve, approve with conditions, or to deny the variance to the Thomas County Board of Commissioners.

Section 4.600 - Inter-governmental land use classification dispute resolution process. 
1.  Prior to initiating any formal annexation activities, the municipality will notify the county of a proposed annexation and provide information on location of property, size of area, and proposed land use or zoning classification(s) (if applicable) of the property. 
Within thirty (30) days following receipt of the above information, the county will forward to the city a statement either: (a) indicating that the county has no objection to the proposed land use for the property; or (b) describing its bona fide objection(s) to the city's proposed land use classification, providing supporting evidence, and listing any possible stipulations or conditions that would alleviate the county's objection(s); 
2.  If the County has no objection to the City's proposed land use or zoning classification, the City is free to proceed with the annexation. If the County fails to respond to the City's notice in writing within the deadline, the City is free to proceed with the annexation and the County loses its right to invoke the dispute resolution process, or object to land use changes after the annexation. 
3.  If the county notifies the city that it has a bona fide land use classification objection(s), the city will respond to the county in writing within thirty (30) days of receiving the county's objection(s) by either: (a) agreeing to implement the county's stipulations and conditions and thereby resolve the county's objection(s); (b) agreeing with the county and stopping action on the proposed annexation; (c) disagreeing that the county's objection(s) are bona fide, the city will initiate a joint meeting of the respective governments to resolve the issue(s). 
4.  If the City initiates mediation, the City and County will agree on a mediator, mediation schedule and determine participants in the mediation. The City and County agree to share equally any costs associated with the mediation. 
5.  An annexation proposal shall not be effective until any bona fide land use classification objections raised by the county are resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution process. 
6.  However, the final resolution of any recommendation of a land use classification will be accorded to the governing body considering the annexation. In cases of land use disputes not related to annexation proposals, the final resolution of a land use dispute will be accorded to the jurisdiction in which the subject property is located. Notwithstanding, a government may seek declaratory judgment in a court of proper jurisdiction pursuant to a land use decision.
