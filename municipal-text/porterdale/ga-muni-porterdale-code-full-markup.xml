PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Porterdale, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2003 Code, as amended through June 2, 2014. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2003 Code, as amended, and any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger Merriam, Code Attorney, and Ramona Connors, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Megan Reid, City Clerk/Treasurer, and Mr. Timothy D. Chambers for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Meetings shall be held in accordance with a regular schedule, but nothing in this subsection shall preclude an agency from canceling or postponing any regularly scheduled meeting. Whenever any meeting required to be open to the public is to be held at a time or place other than at the time and place prescribed for regular meeting, the mayor and city council shall give due notice thereof. 
                  (2)  Due notice shall be the posting of a written notice for at least 24 hours at the place of regular meetings and giving of written or oral notice at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting to the legal organ in which notices of sheriff's sales are published in the county where regular meetings are held or at the option of the mayor and city council to a newspaper having a general circulation in said county at least equal to that of the legal organ; provided, however, that in counties where the legal organ is published less often than four times weekly, due notice shall be the posting of a written notice for at least 24 hours at the place of regular meetings and, upon written request from any local broadcast or print media outlet whose place of business and physical facilities are located in the county, notice by telephone or facsimile to that requesting media outlet at least 24 hours in advance of the called meeting. 
                  (3)  When special circumstances occur and are so declared by the mayor and city council, the mayor and city council may hold a meeting with less than 24 hours' notice upon giving such notice of the meeting and subjects expected to be considered at the meeting as is reasonable under the circumstances including notice to said county legal organ or a newspaper having a general circulation in the county at least equal to that of the legal organ, in which event the reason for holding the meeting within 24 hours and the nature of the notice shall be recorded in the minutes. When any meeting of the city council is closed to the public, the chairperson or other person presiding over such meeting shall execute and file with the official minutes of the meeting a notarized affidavit stating under oath that the subject matter of the meeting or the closed portion thereof was devoted to matters within the exceptions provided by law and identifying the specific relevant exception.

                  Sec. 2-276. - Capital budget policies and capital improvement plan. 
                  (a)  Scope. 
                  (1)  A capital projects plan will be developed and updated annually. A five-year capital improvement program will assist in the planning, acquisition, and financing of capital projects. A major capital project is generally defined as a non-recurring capital expenditure that has an expected useful life of more than ten years and an estimated total cost of $25,000.00 or more. Examples include park improvements, streetscapes, computer systems, trucks, loaders, and expansion of facilities. 
                  (2)  Major capital projects will be budgeted in the capital improvement fund reflecting all available resources. With the involvement of responsible departments, the city manager will prepare the capital budget annually. The city's capital budget will be adopted with the operating budget. 
                  (b)  Control. All capital expenditures must be approved as part of each department budget or in the capital improvement fund. Before committing to a capital improvement project, the city manager or his designee must verify fund availability. 
                  (c)  Program planning. 
                  (1)  The capital budget provides annual funding for long-term capital projects identified in the capital improvement program (CIP). During the annual budget process, each department submits its budget request including operating and capital needs. Upon review of the requests, major capital projects are placed in the capital improvements fund. Other capital outlay is placed in the department's operating budget. Capital outlay is generally defined as an individual item of excess of $5,000.00 with a life expectancy of more than two years but less than ten years. 
                  (2)  Citywide capital improvements are assessed and prioritized based on the city's objectives and goals, the city's comprehensive work plan, and the city's strategic plan. 
                  (d)  Timing. At the beginning of the fiscal year, the city manager or his designee will work with department heads to schedule the appropriate timing of capital purchases to ensure the availability of funds. 
                  (e)  Reporting. Periodic financial reports will be provided to enable the city manager to monitor and control the capital budget and to enable the department heads to manage their capital budgets.

                  Sec. 2-277. - Debt. 
                  (a)  Policy statement. 
                  (1)  Debt results when one borrows from an individual or an institution. The borrower receives funds to acquire resources for current use with an obligation for repayment later. The debt from borrowing generally must be repaid with interest. 
                  (2)  The City of Porterdale recognizes that to maintain flexibility in responding to changing service priorities, revenue inflows, and cost structures, a debt management strategy is required. The city strives to balance service demands and the amount of debt incurred. The city realizes that failure to meet the demands of growth may inhibit its continued economic viability, but also realizes that too much debt may have detrimental effects as well. 
                  (3)  The goal of the city's debt policy is to maintain a sound fiscal position and to protect the credit rating of the city. When the City of Porterdale utilizes debt financing, it will ensure the debt is financed soundly and conservatively. 
                  (b)  Conditions for using debt. Debt financing of capital improvements and equipment will be done only when one or more of the following four conditions exist: 
                  (1)  When non-continuous projects (those not requiring continuous annual appropriations) are desired. 
                  (2)  When it can be determined that future users will receive a benefit from the improvement. 
                  (3)  When it is necessary to provide basic services to residents and taxpayers. 
                  (4)  When total debt, including that issued by overlapping government entities, does not constitute an unreasonable burden to residents and taxpayers. 
                  (c)  Sound financing of debt. When the city utilizes debt financing, it will ensure that the debt is soundly financed by: 
                  (1)  Taking a prudent and cautious stance toward debt, incurring debt only when necessary; 
                  (2)  Conservatively projecting the revenue sources that will be used to pay the debt; 
                  (3)  Ensuring that the term of any long-term debt incurred by the city shall not exceed the expected useful life of the asset for which the debt is incurred and shall be limited to capital improvements only; 
                  (4)  Determining that the benefits of the improvement exceed the costs, including interest costs; 
                  (5)  Maintaining a debt service coverage ratio which ensures that combined debt service requirements will not exceed revenues pledged for the payment of debt; 
                  (6)  Analyzing the impact of debt service on total annual fixed costs before bonded long-term debt is issued; and 
                  (7)  Maintaining total debt service for general obligation debt that does not exceed ten percent of the net operating revenues. Net operating revenues are all general fund revenues available after accounting for transfers between other city funds.

                  Sec. 2-278. - Investments. 
                  (a)  Scope. This section applies to all funds under the City of Porterdale's control; excluding the city's pension funds which are invested at the direction of the City of Porterdale Employees' Retirement System Board of Trustees. 
                  (b)  Objectives. The following investment objectives shall be met with this policy: 
                  (1)  Safety. Preservation of principal shall always be the foremost objective in any investment transaction involving city funds. Those investing funds on the city's behalf must first ensure that capital losses are avoided by limiting credit and interest risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issues or backer. Interest risk is the risk that market value portfolios will fall due to an increase in general interest rates. 
                  (2)  Liquidity. The second objective shall be the maintenance of sufficient liquidity within the investment portfolio. The city's investment portfolio shall be structured such that securities mature at the time when cash is needed to meet anticipated demands (static liquidity). Additionally, since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should maintain some securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity). 
                  (3)  Return on investment. The third objective shall be the realization of competitive investment rates, relative to the risk being assumed. However, yield on the city's investment portfolio is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above. 
                  (c)  Delegation of authority. 
                  (1)  The overall management of the investment program is the responsibility of the city manager. Responsibility for the daily investment activities will be assigned by the city manager. The city manager may designate employees to assist with the management and implementation of the city's investment program. Responsibilities to fulfill this authority include: opening accounts with banks, brokers, and dealers; arranging for the safekeeping of securities; and executing necessary documents. 
                  (2)  A system of internal controls over investments is established and approved by the city's independent auditors. The controls are designed to prevent losses of public funds arising from fraud, error, misrepresentation by third parties, unanticipated changes in financial markets, and/or imprudent action by staff and city officials. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided for under the terms of the policy. 
                  (d)  Authorized investments. 
                  (1)  All investment activity is required to be in compliance with O.C.G.A. title 36, ch. 83, which establishes guidelines for local government investment procedures. 
                  (2)  The City of Porterdale may invest funds subject to its control and jurisdiction in the following: 
                  a.  Certificates of deposit (CD's) issued by banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Deposits in excess of FDIC coverage must be collateralized by securities with a market value equal to at least 110 percent of the deposit. Only those securities described in O.C.G.A. § 50-17-59 can be pledged as collateral; 
                  b.  Certificates of deposit (CD's) issued by savings and loans associations issued by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). Deposits in excess of the FSLIC coverage must be collateralized by securities equal to at least 110 percent of the deposit. Only those securities described in O.C.G.A. § 50-17-59 can be pledged as collateral; 
                  c.  Obligations issued by the United States government; 
                  d.  Obligations fully insured or guaranteed by the United States government or a United States government agency; 
                  e.  Obligation of any corporation of the United States government; 
                  f.  Obligation of the State of Georgia or of other states; 
                  g.  Obligation of other political subdivision of the State of Georgia; 
                  h.  The local government investment pool of the State of Georgia managed by the state department of administrative services, fiscal division; 
                  i.  Repurchase agreements (REPOs) issued by commercial banks insured by the FDIC and collateralized by securities described in O.C.G.A. § 50-17-59 with a market value equal to at least 103 percent of the repurchase agreements' maturity value; 
                  j.  Repurchase agreements (REPOs) issued by primary dealers supervised by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and collateralized by securities described in O.C.G.A. § 50-17-59 with a market value of at least 103 percent of the repurchase agreements' maturity value; and 
                  k.  Prime banker's acceptances. 
                  (e)  Prudence. 
                  (1)  The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the prudent person standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Under the prudent person standard, investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable revenue to be gained. 
                  (2)  The city manager and all designees acting in accordance with written procedures, this investment policy, and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse development. 
                  (f)  Diversification. The City of Porterdale agrees with the premise that diversification is an important component of portfolio security. Therefore, the city shall endeavor to maintain an adequate level of diversification among its investments. The city shall not be over invested in any one type of instrument or financial institution. No more than 25 percent of the total investment portfolio shall be placed with a single issuer. This limitation shall not apply to the local government investment pool or direct obligations of the United States government. 
                  (g)  Maturities. To achieve the aforementioned objective of adequate liquidity within city's portfolio, the city shall attempt to match investment maturities with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow, the maximum maturity of any instrument in the city's portfolio may not exceed two years from the date of acquisition by the city. In order to preserve liquidity and to lessen market risk, not more then 25 percent of the total portfolio may mature more than one year beyond the date of calculation. The maturity of non-negotiable time deposits may not exceed one year. 
                  (h)  Safekeeping and custody. All investment securities purchased by the City of Porterdale shall be delivered against payment and shall be held in a third-party safekeeping account by the trust department of a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The city manager, or his designee, shall be responsible for the selection of a financial institution for this purpose, as well as the execution of a written safekeeping agreement with the trustee. 
                  (i)  Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in the investment process will refrain from personal business activity that would conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which would impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and investment officials will disclose to the city manager any material financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business with the city, and they will further disclose any large personal financial/investment positions that would be related to the performance of the city's portfolio. Employees and investment officials will subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of the city, particularly with regard to the time of purchases and sales. 
                  (j)  Relationships with banks and brokers. The City of Porterdale will select depositories through the city's banking services procurement process, including formal requests for proposals issued as needed. In selecting depositories, objective business criteria will be used. To the extent possible, preference will be given to depositories located within the City of Porterdale. The creditworthiness of the institutions will be a fundamental consideration. 
                  (k)  Report on deposits and investments. Periodic investment reports will be submitted to the city manager. Reports should include the following: an average daily balance of investment in each investment category; a current portfolio yield for each investment type and for the portfolio as a whole; an average daily balance of uninvested collected funds; an average daily balance of uncollected funds; and a percent of available funds invested. The report shall also provide a list of investments and accrued interest as of the last day of the quarter. 
                  (l)  Performance evaluation. The city manager, or his designees, will seek to achieve a market average rate of return on the city's portfolio. Given the special safety and liquidity needs of the city, the basis used to determine whether market yields are being achieved shall be the six-month treasury bill. 
                  (Code 2003, § 4-401(6)) 
                  Sec. 2-279. - Grants. 
                  (a)  Scope. The purpose of this section is to provide direction in the application, acceptance and administration of funds awarded through grants to the city from other local governments, the state or federal government, nonprofit agencies, philanthropic organizations and the private sector. 
                  (b)  Application and acceptance of grants. 
                  (1)  The city manager is given authority to make application for and accept grants that: 
                  a.  Are expected to be $200,000.00 or less on an annual basis with no required city match; 
                  b.  Are expected to be $100,000.00 or less on an annual basis with a required match of 20 percent or less; or 
                  c.  Are expected to be $50,000.00 or less on an annual basis with a required match of over 40 percent. 
                  (2)  The city commission must approve the application of and acceptance of any grants in excess of the limits established in subsection (b)(1) of this section. 
                  (3)  The city will assess the merits of a particular program as if it were funded with local tax dollars. Local tax dollars will not be used to make up for losses of intergovernmental aid without first reviewing the program and its merits as a budgetary increment. Therefore, no grant will be accepted that will incur management and reporting costs greater than the grant amount. 
                  (c)  Grant administration. 
                  (1)  Each department must notify the city clerk/treasurer upon acceptance of any grant. Prior to the receipt or expenditure of grant revenues, the city clerk/treasurer must be provided with the following information prior to receiving grant revenues or making purchases against the grant: 
                  a.  Copy of grant application. 
                  b.  Notification of grant award. 
                  c.  Financial reporting and accounting requirements, including separate account codes and/or bank accounts. 
                  d.  Schedule of grant payments. 
                  (2)  Department is responsible for the management of its grant funds and periodic reporting. 
                  (Code 2003, § 4-401(7)) 
                  Sec. 2-280. - Assets. 
                  (a)  Fixed asset criteria. 
                  (1)  A fixed asset is defined as a financial resource meeting all of the following criteria: 
                  a.  It is tangible in nature. 
                  b.  It has a useful life of greater than one year. 
                  c.  It is not a repair part or supply item. 
                  (2)  A fixed asset has a value equal to, or greater than, the capitalization threshold of $5,000.00. Keeping an accurate record of the city's fixed assets is important for a myriad of reasons. Some of the most important reasons that the city needs to keep a good record of fixed assets are: for financial statement information, for insurable values, for control and accountability, for maintenance scheduling and cost analysis, for estimating and accounting for depreciation, for preparation of capital and operating budgets, and for debt management. 
                  (b)  General policy. 
                  (1)  Department head. The department head is ultimately responsible for the proper recording, acquisition, transfer, and disposal of all assets within their department. City property may not be acquired, transferred, or disposed of without first providing proper documentation. A fixed asset information form must accompany each step. 
                  (2)  Recording of fixed assets. 
                  a.  Unless otherwise approved by the city clerk/treasurer, all recordable fixed assets must be recorded within 30 calendar days after receipt and acceptance of the asset. A fixed asset form must be attached to the purchase order before submitting request for payment. Assets will be capitalized at acquisition cost, including expenses incurred in preparing the asset for use. Donated assets shall be recorded at fair market value as determined by the department head. Fair market value may be defined as, but is not limited to, an average of documented prices for equivalent items from three separate vendors. 
                  b.  The city will recognize acquisition costs based on individual unit prices. Assets should not be grouped. For example, in acquiring equipment, if three personal computers (PC) were acquired simultaneously at $2,000.00 each, this would not be an asset of $6,000.00 consisting of three PCs. Instead, it would be three separate acquisitions of $2,000.00. Each PC would be recorded as a separate controllable item. 
                  c.  For equipment purchases, title is considered to pass at the date the equipment is received. Similarly, for donated assets, title is considered to pass when the asset is available for the agency's use and when the agency assumes responsibility for maintaining the asset. 
                  d.  Constructed assets are transferred from the construction in progress account to the related building, improvements other than buildings, or equipment accounts when they become operational. Constructed buildings, for example, are assumed to be operational when an authorization to occupy the building is issued, regardless of whether or not final payments have been made on all the construction contracts. 
                  (3)  Acquisition of fixed assets. There are various methods by which assets can be acquired. The asset acquisition method determines the basis for valuing the asset. Fixed assets may be acquired in the following ways: 
                  a.  New purchases. 
                  b.  Donations. 
                  c.  Transfers from other city departments. 
                  d.  City surplus. 
                  e.  Internal/external construction. 
                  f.  Lease purchases. 
                  g.  Trade-in. 
                  h.  Forfeiture or condemnation. 
                  (4)  Lease purchases. 
                  a.  Assets may be lease-purchased through installment purchases (an agreement in which title passes to the department) or through lease financing arrangements (an agreement in which title may or may not pass). 
                  b.  Departments considering a lease purchase for greater than $10,000.00 and other than from an established, city-approved contract must consult with the city manager. 
                  (5)  Transfer of fixed assets. An asset transfer between departments usually represents the sale of an item by one department to another and may be treated as a new purchase. A transfer between related departments under the same control (police and fire, for example) may, if desired, be treated as a transfer rather than sale. That is, the asset is recorded under the new department with original acquired date and funding amount. A fixed asset form must be sent to the accounting department for all transfers. 
                  (6)  Sale of fixed assets. Sale of fixed assets by a department must be to the highest, responsible bidder and must be conducted by sealed bid or by auction. The sale must be publicized in accordance with state laws. 
                  (7)  Disposal of fixed assets. 
                  a.  When an asset is disposed of, its value is removed from the financial balances reported and from inventory reports; however, the asset record, including disposal information, remains on the master file for three years, in the city clerk/treasurer's office, after which time it is purged from the system according to general accepted accounting principles. This preserves an audit trail for disposed items, and facilitates departmental comparisons between actual or historical useful life information with useful life guidelines. Such comparisons permit a more precise definition of an asset's useful life than those provided by the internal revenue service (IRS) or other guidelines initially used. 
                  b.  A disposal action is appropriate only when certain conditions occur resulting in an asset no longer being in the possession of the agency. Assets no longer in use, which remain in the possession of the department, are considered surplus property and not a disposal. 
                  c.  Fixed assets may be disposed of in any one of six ways: 
                  1.  Sale or trade-in. 
                  2.  Abandonment/retirement. 
                  3.  Lost or stolen. 
                  4.  Transfer. 
                  5.  Cannibalization (taking parts and employing them for like uses within the department, such as is often the practice in computer or vehicle maintenance). 
                  6.  Casualty loss. 
                  d.  Only when the asset is no longer in possession of the department, due to one of the six reasons listed in subsection (b)(7)c of this section, is disposal action appropriate. 
                  e.  Assets are abandoned or retired when there is no longer any use for them in the department, they are of no use to any other city department, they cannot be repaired, transferred, cannibalized, sold, or traded-in. Thus meaning that there is no safe and appropriate use for the abandoned goods to the city or for others. 
                  f.  Stolen items must be reported to the police and a police report filed. A copy of this report must accompany the disposal record. 
                  g.  Casualty losses must be documented within 24 hours of loss and reported to the city's administrative services director immediately for followup with the city's insurance carrier. 
                  h.  Cannibalized items are considered surplus and are disposed of by noting cannibalization on the disposal record. Ideally, this method will allow departments to look at cannibalized items on the disposal report and assess what surplus parts may be available. Departments will send documentation of items cannibalized to the city clerk/treasurer's office, and all remaining costs and accumulated depreciation will be removed from appropriate asset accounts in the general fixed asset fund. 
                  i.  All assets no longer in the possession of the department, due to one of these six qualifying conditions, and after submission of all appropriate documentation to the city clerk/treasurer's office, will be removed from the master departmental asset file and considered disposed. 
                  j.  Department management is responsible for reviewing disposal reports, evaluating causes and trends leading to disposals, and implementing procedures to more effectively manage and control disposals when the dispositions represent problems, inefficiencies, and/or the incurrence of unnecessary cost. 
                  k.  The sanitation and facilities administration department will not take city property for disposal without the accompaniment of proper documentation. 
                  (8)  Physical inventory. An annual physical inventory of all fixed assets will be performed by the city clerk/treasurer's office. The inventory will be conducted with the least amount of interruption possible to the department's daily operation. A full report of the results of the inventory will be sent, within 30 days of completion, to all departments for verification and acceptance.

                  Sec. 2-340. - Intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to provide guidance for the procurement of goods and services in compliance with procurement provisions of the city and the State of Georgia. The goal of this article is to establish, foster, and maintain the following principles: 
                  (1)  To consider the best interests of the city in all transactions. 
                  (2)  To purchase without prejudice, seeking to obtain the maximum value for each dollar expenditure with maximum quality standards. 
                  (3)  To subscribe to and work for honesty and truth in buying. 
                  (Code 2003, § 4-401(5)(A)) 
                  Sec. 2-341. - Vendors. 
                  The city will make every effort to obtain high quality goods and services at the best possible price. All procurement procedures will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner with avoidance of any impropriety. All qualified vendors have access to city business. No bidder will be arbitrarily or capriciously excluded. It is the intent of the city that competition be sought to the greatest practical degree. The conditions of the contract shall be made clear in advance of the competition. Specifications shall reflect the needs of the city. 
                  (1)  Solicitation of vendors and submission of bids. 
                  a.  When a purchase for a single good is expected to exceed $10,000.00, competition is required to the extent that it exists. Each department must attempt to obtain a minimum of three bids from different sources. If three sources are not possible, the seeker of the bid must attempt to obtain as many vendors as possible. Each department head shall document the competitive bidding process with records of the vendor and bids received. 
                  b.  Each department has full authority to determine and obtain professional and contractual services as provided for in the budget. When possible and practical, competitive quotes for professional and contractual services should be obtained. If competitive quotes are not possible, the city manager must be notified in writing. Each department head shall document the process. 
                  (2)  Interest of city officials in expenditure of public funds. No official of the City of Porterdale will be interested directly or indirectly in any transaction with, sale to, work for, or contract of the city or any department of government or service involving the expenditure of public funds in violation of section 2-122. The city shall not use a vendor who is a member of the immediate family of a city commissioner, city attorney, city manager, assistant city manager, a department head, personnel officer, or payroll clerk. The city shall not use a vendor for services in an operating department who is a member of the immediate family of an employee of that operating department. 
                  (3)  Request for proposal. It is suggested that, whenever appropriate, a request for proposal (RFP) process be used for procuring products and services. The RFP should specify the service, evaluation criteria, and terms and conditions required by the city. Large purchases should be advertised in the legal organ and other venues as time and advertising funds allow. 
                  (4)  Award of bids. Bids are awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. A responsive bid is one that conforms in all material respects to the need of the city. Responsible means a bidder who has the capability to perform the requirements. 
                  (5)  Local bidder preference. If all other relevant factors are met, each department is authorized to negotiate with and select a local vendor if the local vendor's bid is within ten percent of the lowest offer. A current City of Porterdale business license is required to be considered as a local vendor. 
                  (6)  Equal opportunity. The City of Porterdale will provide an equal opportunity for all businesses to participate in city contracts regardless of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation, age, handicapped status, sexual orientation, sexual preference, or transgender status. The city will actively seek to ensure that minority owned and operated firms have the opportunity to participate in the purchasing process, including bidding, negotiations and contract awards. The city will not knowingly conduct business with contractors that discriminate or permit discrimination against persons because of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation, age, handicapped status, sexual orientation, sexual preference, or transgender status. 
                  (7)  Ineligible vendors. Any person, firm, or corporation who is in arrears to the city for taxes, or otherwise, will not be qualified to bid on any purchase until their lien to the city has been cleared. No requisition will be approved for such vendors. 
                  (8)  State contracts. The city is authorized to use state contracts in lieu of issuing bids to vendors or buying locally when it is to the economic advantage of the city or deemed appropriate by the city manager. The state contract price may be used to establish the maximum price for a good or service. 
                  (9)  Backup policy and emergency purchases. 
                  a.  The city should strive to decrease dependency on single-source vendors in order to achieve maximum efficiency in its purchases. In order to achieve the city's fiscal independence, it is strongly suggested that each department have backup vendors for each recurring and/or large purchase. 
                  b.  In cases of emergency, a contract may be awarded without competitive bidding, but the procurement shall be made with as much competition as the circumstances allow (i.e., informal quotes). An emergency is defined as a threat to life or property, or an unforeseen situation that curtails or greatly diminishes an essential service as determined by the city manager. In the event of an emergency, the city manager shall be contacted.

                  (1)  Each department head shall have the authority to purchase individual goods costing less than $1,000.00 each, as long as costs remain within the approved budget. Each department head is responsible to ensure that internal control procedures, including those issued by the city manager, are followed. 
                  (2)  For individual goods costing over $1,000.00, the department shall make every effort to solicit a minimum of three competitive prices. To the extent that an emergency condition exists or an item is supplied by only one source, the department head shall inform the city manager and make the appropriate notation on the purchase order. 
                  (b)  Monitoring of purchases. Although authority may be delegated, the ultimate responsibility rests with the city manager. Purchases must be monitored to ensure compliance with city policy.

                  Sec. 2-344. - Petty cash. 
                  Petty cash is used to make small cash disbursements for those purchases that must be made quickly and without prior notice on a contingency basis. Each department has a petty cash expense account. Petty cash is incurred as an expense for each department. The petty cash account must be replenished by a purchase order (PO) for the individual department. Departments are monitored at least twice a year to verify account balances.

                  a.  Under $50.00: Cash is distributed at the department level with department head approval.

                  (2)  The following is the city's procedure for petty cash:

                  b.  The petty cash request is approved by the department head. 
                  c.  Petty cash is then received by the requesting party.

                  Sec. 6-3. - General responsibilities of owners. 
                  (a)  It shall be the duty of every owner of an animal to take all necessary steps and precautions to protect other people, property, and other animals from injury or damage resulting from such animal's behavior, including, but not limited to, chasing, biting, or otherwise jeopardizing the safety or welfare of the public, regardless of whether such behavior is motivated by mischievousness, playfulness, or ferocity.

                  (a)  Limitation on number of animals per dwelling unit.

A single unit providing complete independent living facilities for one or more person, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation." Provided, however, that if any single building (as defined in section 119-2) contains more than one dwelling unit, then no more than two animals may be kept or housed in or upon the grounds of each dwelling unit contained within the single structure. By way of example, this limitation would apply in the case of apartment buildings, duplexes, and condominiums.

Following the death of an animal, or other relinquishment or loss of possession of an animal, other than relinquishment on a voluntary, temporary basis, the owner shall not replace the animal if the result of the replacement of that animal would cause there to be more than three animals kept or housed in or upon the grounds of the owner's dwelling unit. The purpose of this subsection is to provide a "grandfathering" provision for those owners who are keeping or housing more than three animals as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, so as not to require any such owners to dispose of an animal to comply with the limitation on the number of animals per dwelling unit created by this section. 
                  (3)  The limitation on the number of animals that may be kept or housed in or upon the grounds of any one dwelling unit established by subsection (a)(1) of this section shall not apply to a dwelling unit located upon a lot (as defined in section 119-2) in an RR, R1 or R2 zoning district of three acres or greater in size; provided, however, that no more than one dwelling unit is located upon the lot, provided further that all other provisions of this chapter are satisfied, and provided that in no instances shall more than seven animals be kept or housed in or upon a lot meeting the requirements of this exemption. 
                  (4)  Except as otherwise provided in section 6-12(a)(2) of this Code of Ordinances, animals normally kept as collections or in groups are exempted from the limitation on number of animals per dwelling unit set out in this section 6-4. Examples of animals normally kept as collections or in groups are fish, reptiles or amphibians in home aquariums, or decorative ponds, rodents such as hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, or mice, and birds such as finches or parakeets kept in cages. 
                  (5)  No wild animal shall be kept as a pet or confined unless specifically licensed by the state department of natural resources. 
                  (6)  Animals allowed in agricultural zoning districts (AG-G) are exempt from this limitation. 
                  (b)  Time limit within which to dispose of animal litters. From and after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, any owner whose animal bears a litter such that the number of animals in the owner's dwelling unit is increased beyond the limitation of three created under subsection (a)(1) of this section, or beyond the number of animals registered by the owner under the "grandfather" provision of subsection (a)(2) of this section, shall have 90 days within which to dispose of the excess number of animals above the limit of three animals per dwelling unit. This exception is not intended to allow the commercial or frequent breeding of animals, which is prohibited in RR, R1, R2, R3, and MU zoning districts.

                  (b)  Any person who has been convicted of failure to keep an animal under restraint while on the owner's property as provided in this Code and has been required to provide additional confinement requirements and has not complied with the court's order, shall not be allowed to own a pet in his City of Porterdale household for three years from the date of conviction.

                  Sec. 8-50. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system by any person; 
                  (2)  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system; 
                  (3)  Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the municipal separate storm sewer system; and 
                  (4)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
                  (Code 2003, § 21-202(1); Ord. of 10-2-2006(3)) 
                  Sec. 8-51. - Introduction. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
                  (2)  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
                  (3)  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
                  (4)  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
                  (5)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
                  (6)  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
                  (7)  Therefore, the City of Porterdale adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

This sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the owner or operator at his own expense. All devices used to measure flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
                  (5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the property or facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the owner or operator at the written or oral request of the City of Porterdale and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner or operator. 
                  (6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the City of Porterdale access to a facility is a violation of this article. 
                  (7)  If the City of Porterdale has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the City of Porterdale is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, environment and welfare of the community, then the City of Porterdale may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

                  ARTICLE XVI. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 
                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 10-700. - Purpose, findings, intent, and incorporation of recitals. 
                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote and protect the public health, safety, good order, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, to establish reasonable and uniform regulations of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing an unreasonable limitation or unreasonable restriction on the content of any lawful communicative materials including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to unreasonably restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene or otherwise illegal material. 
                  (b)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the council, as contained in the report to the mayor and city council of the city on regulation of sexually oriented businesses, prepared by the city attorney and on file with the office of the city clerk, and other matters and documents relating to all of the above, which report and materials hereby are incorporated by this reference, the city council finds: 
                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses. Further, there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
                  (2)  Sexually oriented businesses can lead to significant negative secondary effects, such as increased crime rates and increased ambient crime risk in the surrounding areas. 
                  (3)  The negative secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses are present in urban environments, suburban environments, and in rural areas. 
                  (4)  The negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses can be associated with all business models, including those that provide adult entertainment only for off-site consumption. 
                  (5)  The negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses are exacerbated by allowing such businesses to cluster together. 
                  (6)  The negative secondary effects associated with the presence of sexually oriented businesses in small towns are likely to be magnified beyond that which would be expected in larger cities because of the more compact nature of downtowns and their relationship to surrounding neighborhoods. 
                  (7)  Certain workers of certain sexually oriented businesses defined in this article engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments. 
                  (8)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private areas, booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers. 
                  (9)  Offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities, which create unhealthy conditions. 
                  (10)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult video facilities, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments. 
                  (11)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and, in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
                  (12)  Studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
                  (13)  The findings noted in paragraphs (1)—(12), and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns. 
                  (14)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
                  (15)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order, health, safety and welfare of its patrons and workers, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
                  (16)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters and adult video facilities. 
                  (17)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments. 
                  (18)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
                  (19)  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article. 
                  (20)  Commercial establishments exist in nearby cities and counties in Georgia where sexually oriented material is possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold for commercial purposes in the form of books, magazines, periodicals or other printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides, computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties, devices, or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas. 
                  (21)  Commercial establishments exist in nearby cities or counties in Georgia where sexually oriented commercial activities in the form of nude, semi-nude, or topless dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
                  (22)  Commercial sexually oriented businesses exist in nearby cities or counties in Georgia where sexually oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact, and other services providing sexual encounters. The workers of such sexually oriented businesses operating in Georgia engage in physical contact or touching with customers including, but not limited to, acts of prostitution, or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness. 
                  (23)  The activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses occur at establishments and businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order, health, safety, economy, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the city. 
                  (24)  When the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses are present in establishments and businesses, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
                  (25)  When the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described above and, ultimately, lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
                  (26)  The activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses sometimes occur in establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers, and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, commerce, and community environment. 
                  (27)  Physical contact or touching within sexually oriented businesses between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both, and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
                  (28)  In order to preserve and safeguard the good order, health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, workers, entertainers, performers, and customers at sexually oriented businesses. 
                  (29)  The potential dangers to the good order, health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting a sexually oriented business to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this article are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
                  (30)  Requiring operators of sexually oriented businesses to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer contacts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such establishments. 
                  (31)  Prohibiting sexually oriented businesses from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential use, and parks at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse effects of the activities that accompany such establishments and businesses. 
                  (32)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in sexually oriented businesses have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers, and pose a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression. 
                  (33)  Sexually oriented businesses involve some activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit, rather than speech or expressive activity and, therefore, are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health, good order, morals, welfare and safety of the community. 
                  (34)  The general welfare, health, good order, and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article. 
                  (c)  Intent. It is the intent of this article to protect and preserve the good order, health, peace, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Porterdale. This article regulates conduct and is not an ordinance that affects the use of land as contemplated by O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1 et seq. 
                  (d)  Authority. This article is enacted under the constitutionally derived home rule power of the city in the interest of the good order, health, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city. 
                  (e)  Recitals. It is the city council's further intention to accomplish those intents and purposes expressed by the city council in the recitals of the ordinance from which this section derives, each of which are incorporated by reference into this section. 
                  (f)  Speech protection. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit constitutionally protected expression or speech. This article is intended to reasonably regulate sexually oriented businesses which engage in commercial activities involving acts or services of a sexually explicit nature or which involve acts or services involving matters which are sexual in nature.

                  Sec. 10-706. - Purpose and intent. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent deleterious effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent or effect of this article to in any way condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material or material harmful to minors. Rather, it is the purpose of the article to regulate sexually oriented business establishments to prevent increases in criminal activity and undesirable community conditions. It is recognized that such regulation cannot approach prohibition, or a protected form of expression would vanish. Therefore, this article represents an attempt to balance the competing interests of reduced criminal activity and neighborhood protection versus the rights of sexually oriented business establishments and patrons.

An applicant may appeal the decision of the city manager regarding such denial by filing a written request for a hearing with the city clerk within ten days after the applicant has been given notice of such denial.

                  (d)  The provisions of subsection (c) of this section 10-712 shall not be construed to prohibit a sexually oriented business for which there is a license from relocating to another location situated within 1,000 feet of its existing location, provided that the proposed location complies with all applicable requirements of this article other than its proximity to its own existing sexually oriented business location. An original license application shall be required to be filed for the proposed relocation, and the city manager shall conditionally grant the application, if granted, on the stipulation that the license will not actually be issued until the applicant discontinues operation at its existing location and surrenders the license for its existing location.

                  Sec. 10-713. - Nontransferability of license; alteration. 
                  (a)  No license for a sexually oriented business may be sold, transferred or assigned by a licensee, or by operation of law, to any other person(s) or business entity. Any such sale, transfer or assignment, or attempted sale, transfer or assignment, shall be deemed to constitute a voluntary surrender of such license and such license shall thereafter be null and void; provided and excepting, however, that if the licensee is a partnership and one or more of the partners should die, one or more of the surviving partners may acquire, by purchase or otherwise, the interest of the deceased partner or partners without effecting a surrender or termination of such license, and in such case, the license, upon notification to the city, shall be placed in the name of the surviving partner. 
                  (b)  A license issued to a corporation shall be deemed terminated and void when either any outstanding stock of the corporation is sold, transferred or assigned after the issuance of license, or any stock authorized but not issued at the time of the granting of such license and is thereafter issued and sold, transferred or assigned. 
                  (c)  A license issued to a limited liability company shall be deemed terminated and void when any members and managers are added who previously have not been identified on the license application.

                  Sec. 14-28. - Duties of owners; appointment of public officer; procedures for determining premises to be unsafe or unhealthful. 
                  (a)  Whenever a request is filed with the city manager by a public authority or by at least five residents of the City of Porterdale charging that any dwelling, building, or structure is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the code enforcement officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. If the code enforcement officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the code enforcement officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the owner and interested parties in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the owner of the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and interested parties that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction as determined by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain and at a place within the city where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in court. The owner and interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
                  (b)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure, in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations, cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia Appraiser Classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 41, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (c)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the city manager may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, improved, to be vacated and closed, or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The code enforcement officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes and endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (d)  If the city manager has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any monies received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The city manager and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (e)  (1)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (2)  a.  The lien provided for herein shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(c). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes, to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  b.  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this article, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this article shall transmit to the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. title 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. A county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to this article in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county or municipality whose lien is being collected. 
                  c.  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this section may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this article. 
                  d.  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this section shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this section, together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority, county tax commissioner, municipal tax collector, or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (3)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (4)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (5)  The code enforcement officer designated herein may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article. 
                  (6)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

                  ARTICLE II. - EXCAVATIONS 

                  Sec. 22-45. - Exemption. 
                  The provisions of this article shall not be applicable to any excavation work carried out under the direction of competent city authorities by employees of the city. 
                  (Code 2003, § 22-103(23)) 
                  Sec. 22-46. - Permit. 
                  (a)  Permit required. It shall be unlawful for any person to dig up, break, excavate, tunnel, undermine, or in any manner break up any street, or to make or cause to be made any excavation in or under the surface of any street for any purpose, or to place, deposit, or leave upon any street any earth or other excavated material obstructing or tending to interfere with the free use of the street, unless such person shall first have obtained an excavation permit from the city manager in the manner specified in this article. 
                  (b)  Excavation permit fee. The excavation permit fee to be collected by the city manager shall be in an amount as determined by council. Projects located in the historic district must first receive approval from the historic preservation commission. 
                  (c)  Surety bond. Each applicant for an excavation permit shall be required to file a surety bond with the city manager in the amount as determined by the council. The required surety bond must be: 
                  (1)  With good and sufficient surety approved by the city council; 
                  (2)  Satisfactory to the city attorney in form and substance; and 
                  (3)  Conditioned upon the permittee's agreement to secure and hold harmless the city and its officers against any and all claims, judgments, or other costs arising from the excavation and other work covered by the excavation permit or for which the city, the city council, or any city officer may be made liable by reason of any accident or injury to persons or property through the fault of the permittee either in not properly guarding the excavation or for any other injury resulting from the negligence of the permittee, and further conditioned on the permittee's agreement to fill up, restore, and place in good and safe condition as near as may be to its original condition, and to the satisfaction of the city manager, all openings and excavations made in streets, and to maintain any street where excavation is made in as good condition for the period of 24 months after said work shall have been done, usual wear and tear excepted, as it was in before said work shall have been done. Any settlement of the surface within said two-year period shall be deemed conclusive evidence of defective backfilling by the permittee, except that nothing herein contained shall be construed to require the permittee to maintain any repairs to pavement made by the city if such repairs should prove defective. Recovery on such bond for any injury or accident shall not exhaust the bond, but it shall in its entirety cover any or all future accidents or injuries during the excavation work for which it is given. In the event of any suit or claim against the city by reason of the negligence or default of the permittee, upon the city's giving written notice to the permittee of such suit or claim, any final judgment against the city requiring it to pay for such damage shall be conclusive upon the permittee and its surety.

                  Sec. 22-47. - Routing of traffic. 
                  The permittee shall take appropriate measures to ensure that during the performance of the excavation work, traffic conditions shall be maintained at all times as nearly normal as practicable so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to the occupants to the abutting property and to the general public, provided that the city manager may recommend the closing of streets to all traffic for a period of time if in his opinion it is necessary. The permittee shall route and control traffic, including its own vehicles, as directed by the police department. The following steps shall be taken before any highway may be closed or restricted to traffic: 
                  (1)  The permittee must receive the approval of the city manager and the police department. 
                  (2)  The permittee must notify the fire chief of any street so closed. 
                  (3)  Upon completion of construction work the permittee shall notify the city manager and the police department before traffic is moved back to its normal flow so that any necessary adjustments may be made. 
                  (4)  Where flagmen are deemed necessary by the police chief, they shall be furnished by the permittee at its own expense. Through traffic shall be maintained without the aid of detours, if possible. In instances in which this would not be feasible, the city manager will designate detours. The city shall maintain roadway surfaces of existing highways designated as detours without expense to the permittee, but in case there are no existing highways, the permittee shall construct all detours at its expense and in conformity with the specifications of the city manager. The permittee will be responsible for any unnecessary damage caused to any highways by the operation of its equipment.

                  The permittee shall construct and maintain adequate and safe crossings over excavations and across highways under improvement to accommodate vehicular and pedestrian traffic at all street intersections. Vehicular crossings shall be constructed and maintained of plank, timbers, and blocking of adequate size to accommodate vehicular traffic safely; pedestrian crossings shall be of adequate thickness, width, and length, together with necessary blocking, to ensure safe passage by pedestrians.

                  The permittee shall not interfere with any existing utility without the written consent of the city manager and the utility company or person owning the utility. If it becomes necessary to remove an existing utility, this shall be done by its owner. No utility owned by the city shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work be borne by the permittee.

                  (a)  The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including, but not limited to, social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services.

                  (b)  Such increased ad valorem tax shall be applied and reflected in the first tax bill rendered following official designation of a real property as blighted.

                  (2)  A written inspection report of the findings for any parcel of property inspected pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall be prepared and submitted to the public officer. Where feasible, photographs of the conditions found to exist on the property on the date of inspection shall be made and supplement the inspection report.

If, in his discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee immediately shall report such red flags to the city manager and city clerk/treasurer. If, in his discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city clerk/treasurer, who may in his discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the city clerk/treasurer, in his discretion, determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the city clerk/treasurer:

                  (4)  Notify a debt collection with 36 hours of the discovery of likely or probable identity theft relating to a customer account that has been sold to such debt collector in the event that a customer's account has been sold to a debt collector prior to the discovery of the likelihood or probability of identity theft relating to such account; 
                  (5)  Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or 
                  (6)  Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft. 
                  (b)  In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect to an application for a new account, such employee shall use his discretion to determine whether such red flags or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city manager and city clerk/treasurer. If, in his discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city clerk/treasurer, who may in his discretion determine that no further action is necessary.

                  Sec. 28-57. - Updating the program. 
                  The city council shall annually review and, as deemed necessary by the council, update the identity theft prevention program along with any relevant red flags in order to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the city and its covered accounts from identity theft.

                  The city clerk/treasurer is responsible for oversight of the program and for program implementation. The city manager and city clerk/treasurer are responsible for reviewing reports prepared by staff regarding compliance with red flag requirements and with recommending material changes to the program, as necessary, in the opinions of the city manager and city clerk/treasurer to address changing identity theft risks and to identify new or discontinued types of covered accounts. Any recommended material changes to the program shall be submitted to the city council for consideration. 
                  (1)  The city clerk/treasurer will report to the city manager, at least annually, on compliance with the red flag requirements. The report will address material matters related to the program and evaluate issues such as: 
                  a.  The effectiveness of the policies and procedures of the city in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; 
                  b.  Service provider arrangements;

                  Editor's note— Ord. of 8-24-2017(1) , § 1, amended Ch. 105 in its entirety to read as herein set out. The former Ch. 105 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Code 2003, §§ 34-101.1—34-101.6; and Ord. of 8-6-2007. See the Code Comparative Table for a detailed analysis. 

                  Sec. 105-1. - Intent and disclaimer. 
                  (a)  Intent. The intent of this chapter is to regulate and restrict uses and structures within floodplain areas of the city in order to protect life and property, to prevent or minimize the hazards and damage which follow periods of severe inundation and to reduce the public cost of rescue efforts, relief efforts and flood control activities made necessary by such inundation; to protect the natural function and character of the floodplain and surrounding areas; and to enable owners of property within the city to qualify for national flood insurance. 
                  (b)  Disclaimer of liability. The city council finds the degree of flood protection required by this chapter to be reasonable and consistent with historically established and nationally accepted levels of protection based on scientific and engineering practices. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the floodway, floodplain, special flood hazard area, or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
                  ( Ord. of 8-24-2017(1), § 1 ) 
                  Sec. 105-2. - Flood insurance study and maps adopted. 
                  The Federal Emergency Management Agency flood insurance study, flood hazard boundary map and flood insurance rate map, for the City of Porterdale, Georgia, effective March 17, 2014 or as it may be revised, shall constitute the official flood maps for the city. Revisions of such maps shall include but not be limited to future conditions maps. All land shown on said maps as lying within a "special flood hazard area", and all other land subject to inundation during the base flood, as confirmed by a flood study or a field run survey, shall be subject to the regulations set forth in this chapter. 
                  ( Ord. of 8-24-2017(1), § 1 ) 
                  Sec. 105-3. - Definitions.

                  ( Ord. of 8-24-2017(1), § 1 ) 
                  Sec. 105-4. - Permits required. 
                  (a)  Permit required. Use of lands and buildings, and construction, reconstruction, repair, modification or demolition of any structure within all floodplains, including special flood hazard areas, shall require review and approval of a permit by the city. 
                  (b)  Flood study or field run survey required. The Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps, more particularly described and adopted by the city in section 105-2, are used for general reference purposes only. A flood study or a field run survey may be required to determine the location and extent of the floodplain area on a specific parcel. 
                  (1)  Flood study. In an unmapped floodplain or in a mapped floodplain where elevation has not been established, a flood study may be required in order to establish the base flood elevation. Such a flood study shall address, at a minimum, impact to upstream, downstream and adjacent properties, and the free flow of flood waters. 
                  (2)  Field run survey. In order to establish the horizontal extent of the vertical floodplain elevation, a field run survey may be required to establish the actual location of the limit when proposed development is proximate to the limits of a floodplain/floodway. 
                  (3)  A flood study or field run survey required under this subsection shall be certified by either a professional engineer or registered land surveyor. 
                  (c)  Review and approval. Any proposal which includes any of the activities described in this chapter shall be submitted to the city for review before any such activity is commenced. The city may authorize the approval of any of such activities upon a finding, based on detailed plans and specifications submitted with the proposal, that the activity can be completed and occupied or used in full compliance with the requirements of this chapter. No part of any such activity shall be commenced before such permit approval has been issued and all other permits and licenses required by applicable law have been issued or obtained. 
                  (d)  Permit revocation. The city may revoke any such permit when the city determines the activity is not being accomplished, or that the land is not being used or occupied, as shown on the plans and specifications approved by the city. A permit approval so revoked may be reinstated upon application by the holder under such rules and conditions as are established by the city consistent with the requirements of this chapter and other applicable laws. 
                  (e)  Protection of existing flood storage and protection of upstream, downstream, and adjacent lands from flooding. The city shall not, by authorizing the approval of a permit under the authority of this chapter, authorize any use of land, any extension or enlargement of a use of land which existed before the original date of enactment of the provisions of said chapter, or the commencement of any of the activities described in this chapter, where the effect thereof would be to decrease the volume of existing flood storage on that land or to increase flooding conditions upstream, downstream or adjacent to that land. 
                  (1)  Protection of floodways. The floodway shall be that as defined in the flood insurance study and maps, City of Porterdale, Georgia, Newton County, Federal Emergency Management Agency, effective March 17, 2014 or as it may be subsequently revised or extended. On those watercourses and rivers regulated hereunder where the floodway has not been defined in the said flood insurance study and until such time as these watercourses and rivers are defined in an officially adopted or revised flood insurance study, the floodway shall be defined as the channel of the watercourse or river and the adjacent areas of the defined or undefined floodplain that must be reserved in order to discharge the 100-year base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot upstream of, downstream of, or at the point being considered. No fill or encroachments shall be placed within the defined floodway that would impair the ability to carry and discharge the waters resulting from the 100-year base flood. 
                  (2)  Floodplain protection. The city shall not authorize the approval of any permit authorizing the placement of fill or stored materials, or the construction of any building or other structure within the floodplain, other than public purpose or public use infrastructure. Earth-disturbing activities in the floodplain shall be permitted only when the resulting configuration shall allow stormwater to enter the floodway by sheet flow (not channelized flow) and results in no loss of existing flood volume. Any earth-disturbing activities within a floodplain shall be subject to requirements of stream bank buffer limits and should be constructed using best management practices for soil erosion and sedimentation control. The use of compensating excavation or contouring procedures to modify flood hazard limits may only apply to install necessary public infrastructure within the flood limits to support existing and new property(s) which are not within the flood limits, and for purposes of creating or maintaining walkways and/or trails dedicated to public use. 
                  All applications for permits issued by the city which would allow any use or construction wholly or partly in a special flood hazard area shall include detailed plans and specifications which demonstrate that no expansion of a special flood hazard area would result from the work which would be authorized by any such permit. No such permit shall authorize any proposed use or construction which would have a finished elevation less than two feet higher than the nearest base flood elevation and that would be closer than 15 feet from the nearest base flood elevation, and no such permit shall be issued until the plans and specifications submitted are in compliance with this chapter and have been authorized by the city. Any comments or requirements endorsed on such plans and specifications or on an addendum thereto, by the city shall become a part of any permit issued for the work covered by the plans and specifications and shall be enforced as are all other requirements applicable to such permit. 
                  (3)  Modification to existing structures or existing usages of the floodplain in violation of, but predating the provisions of this chapter. Minor modifications and routine maintenance of uses and structures which were lawful prior to the original date of enactment of the provisions of this chapter, including existing structures, fills, pavements, utilities, manufactured homes, mobile homes, mobile home sites and other facilities, shall be subject to the following restrictions: 
                  a.  Permitted modifications of existing structures or existing usage. Any modification to an existing usage, when such existing usage is in violation of this chapter, that enhances the protection of life or property or which is reasonably necessary to the maintenance and upkeep of the property concerned and which does not extend the scope and magnitude of the existing violation of these regulations, is permitted provided the value of such modification or maintenance does not exceed 50 percent of the value of the structure or total existing usage prior to such modification or maintenance, excluding the value of the land but including the value of existing structures, utility service connections, fills, pavements, slabs, mobile home sites and other facilities which can be reasonably demonstrated as an integral part of that existing usage. 
                  b.  Modifications requiring additional measures. Any improvement, modification or maintenance and any repairs or reconstruction required by any reason, including damages arising from normal deterioration, flood, other natural act or accident, of any existing usage where such existing usage is in violation of this chapter, shall bring that existing usage under the scope of the regulations set forth in this subsection; and that existing usage shall be brought into compliance with this chapter, providing that the total value of such improvement, modification, maintenance, repair or reconstruction exceeds 50 percent of the value of the structure or existing usage before such improvement, modification or maintenance or before such flood, other natural act or accident, excluding the value of the land but including the prior value of structures, utility service connections, fills, pavements, slabs, mobile home sites and other facilities which can be reasonably demonstrated as an integral part of the existing usage prior to the event.

                  (b)  Substantially damaged or substantially improved structures. If an existing single-family residential structure located within the floodplain, floodway, or special flood hazard area has sustained substantial damage or is proposed for substantial improvement, the structure shall be relocated not less than 15 feet horizontally and two feet vertically beyond the nearest base flood elevation. 
                  (c)  Elevating existing single-family structures. If, due to site conditions, an existing single-family residential structure cannot comply with the 15-foot horizontal requirement, in accordance with section 105-5.1(b), the structure may be elevated in accordance with either section 105-5.5(b) or (c); provided however, section 105-5.5(a) shall apply to all elevated structures regardless of whether section 105-5.5(b) or (c) applies. 
                  (d)  Flood protecting single-family residential structures. An existing single-family residential structure that has not been substantially damaged or is not proposed for substantial improvement can be flood protected, in accordance with section 105-5.5(d). A new single-family residential structure or an existing single-family residential structure that has been substantially damaged or is proposed for substantial improvement cannot be flood protected in order to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  ( Ord. of 8-24-2017(1), § 1 ) 
                  Sec. 105-5.2. - Multifamily residential structures in floodplain areas. 
                  (a)  New development.

                  Sec. 105-9. - Appeal. 
                  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of the denial or issuance of a permit, aggrieved or adversely affected parties may file an appeal with the city. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall include a copy of the initial denial or issuance of the permit. 
                  (b)  Upon receipt of an appeal, and for good cause, the city may suspend the permit, or applicable portions thereof, pending review. Within 30 days after receipt of an appeal, the city shall make a determination and shall notify the appellant. 
                  (c)  The city's determination may be appealed to the Superior Court of Newton County. Such appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the date of issuance of the city's determination as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1 and will be reviewed under the standard provided by O.C.G.A. § 50-13-19(h).

                  Sec. 107-58. - Requirements for adopting an ordinance for the designation of historic districts and historic properties. 
                  (a)  Application for designation of historic districts of property. Designations may be proposed by the Porterdale City Council, the commission, or:

                  (Code 2003, § 39-503(4); Ord. of 5-7-2012(2)) 
                  Sec. 107-59. - Historic district designation. 
                  (1)  Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  The mayor and city council have found and determined that the historical, cultural and aesthetic heritage of the city are among its most valued and important assets and that the preservation of this heritage is essential to the promotion of the health, prosperity and general welfare of the people. 
                  (b)  The areas of the City of Porterdale being designated as historic districts are among the best surviving examples of mill communities in Georgia, including three distinct mill complexes, an intact mill village, and numerous community landmark buildings, significant under themes of industry, community planning and development, and architecture. 
                  (c)  In accordance with the ordinance to establish a historic preservation commission in the city, to provide for the designation of historic properties of historic districts, to provide for issuance of certificates of appropriateness, to provide for an appeals procedure, to repeal conflicting ordinances, and for other purposes as set forth in chapter 107 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Porterdale, the mayor and council hereby declare it to be the purpose and intent of this section to designate historic districts in geographically definable areas containing buildings, structures, sites, objects, landscape features and works of art or a combination thereof, which have special historic and aesthetic value or interest in representing one or more eras in the history of the City of Porterdale, Newton County, Georgia. 
                  (d)  There are three districts being established hereby, designated as follows: 
                  1.  The Rose Hill Historic District. This district is situated on either side of North Broad Street/State Route 81 at the easternmost edge of the National Register and Porterdale municipal boundaries. Out of 33 properties, there are 18 remaining contributing historic resources within this small district. Most of the contributing resources were built in 1912. A reflection of the Jim Crow era, the Rose Hill neighborhood specifically was built for the African-American mill workforce. The district is significant not only for its examples of architecture, but also as an example of early 20th century community planning as it affected African-Americans. The district is significant as an example of social history and African-American ethnic heritage. The saddlebag houses were built smaller and situated nearer to one another than in other areas of the city, and were located furthest from the mills. 
                  2.  The Residential Historic District. This is the largest of the local historic districts in Porterdale, encompassing most of the properties within the National Register district boundaries that are not identified in the Rose Hill or Downtown Commercial Districts. Out of 508 properties, there are 475 contributing historic resources within this district. Seven houses originally were located on property south of the Yellow River that was first settled as Cedar Shoals, but were later moved to the north side of the river. The majority of the mill workers' housing units located in the Residential Historic District were constructed during the first two decades of the 20th century. These houses consist predominantly of four- and six-room wood framed houses and four-room gabled-ell houses. Six-room duplexes were constructed on empty lots within the district between 1920 and the early 1940's, many of which were later divided into apartments. This district is significant for its examples of late 19th and early 20th Century Revival architecture (Colonial, Late Gothic, Tudor), and early 20th Century American Movement. In addition, the district is significant as an example of community planning and development, as the residential areas were planned and developed as integral components of mill operations. The Residential Historic District is described in two sections: The first section consists of the historic residential areas of the city lying east of the Yellow River, while the second section consists of the historic residential areas lying west of the Yellow River. 
                  3.  The Downtown Commercial Historic District. This district encompasses 28 commercial properties, most of which are situated along Main Street/State Route 81 from the Yellow River to the west and the former Welaunee Inn on the easternmost boundary. Included in this district is the still operational Osprey Mill complex, nestled within the residential district north of Main Street. Within this district, there are 24 remaining contributing historic resources, the oldest of which was built in the 1890's. The three mill complexes encompassed within the Downtown Commercial District are significant as they provide an understanding of all aspects of textile mill operations in Georgia, which operations were a major component of the state's economy for a century, beginning in the middle of the 19th century. Included within the Downtown Commercial District are the railroad depot, office buildings contracted for use of mill executives, a commissary building serving the community, and the Porter Memorial Gymnasium (although damaged by fire, recently partially reconstructed and re-purposed as an events venue). The Downtown Commercial Historic District is described in two sections: The first section consists of the historic mill complex lying north of Main Street/State Route 81, and surrounded by the Residential Historic District; the second section consists of the historic mill complexes and buildings situated along Main Street/State Route 81. 
                  (2)  Districts created. There hereby are created and designated in and for the City of Porterdale three historic districts, to be known as the Rose Hill Historic District, the Residential Historic District, and the Downtown Commercial Historic District. Individual district boundaries necessarily will follow a mixture of street rights-of-way and legal property boundaries, as denoted on the Porterdale Commercial, Residential and Rose Hill Local Historic Districts Map prepared by the Northeast Georgia Regional Commission, effective date January 7, 2016, which map is attached hereto as Attachment A and made a part hereof by this reference, and which district boundaries are described as follows:

               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 109-1. - Preamble and findings. 
                  (a)  Whereas land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition. 
                  (b)  Whereas land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased non-point source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
                  (c)  Whereas the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
                  (d)  Whereas, these adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits. 
                  (e)  Whereas localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and non-point source pollution. 
                  (f)  Whereas the City of Porterdale (the "city") does enact this stormwater management ordinance to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and non-point source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  (g)  Therefore, the mayor and the council of the City of Porterdale hereby enact and ordain this chapter.

                  Sec. 109-3. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, non-point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the city and county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  Sec. 111-2. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  This section provides for the protection of river corridors and the regulation of activities in or adjacent to those corridors; provides for the powers and duties of City of Porterdale and other governmental entities; provides for goals, guidelines, practices, procedures, policies, rules, and regulations; provides for minimum standards for regulated activities within river corridors and their buffers which natural resources of the county are of vital importance to this county and its citizens; provides for a review of decision; provides for hearings and judicial review; provides for enforcement; prohibits certain activities or actions; provides for civil and other penalties; repeals conflicting ordinances; and other proposes. 
                  (b)  The State of Georgia has determined that its river corridors are of vital importance in that they help preserve those qualities that made a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors are fragile natural resources subject to flood, erosion, soil-bearing capacity limitation, and other natural and human induced hazards. In their natural state they serve multiple functions for pollution control, aquifer recharge and discharge, storage and passage of floodwater, and erosion and sedimentation control, as well as wildlife habitat, education, scientific study, open space and recreation, and scenic and aesthetic beauty. 
                  (c)  The Georgia Planning Act of 1989 (O.C.G.A. §§ 50-8-7.1, 50-8-7.2) provides for the development of coordinated and comprehensive planning by municipal and county governments. Such comprehensive plans shall consider the natural resources, environments, and vital areas within the jurisdiction of the local governments. Additionally, O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 authorizes the department of natural resources to develop minimum planning standards and procedures for the protection of river corridors in the state and requires local government to use these minimum standards in developing and implementing, local comprehensive plans, the method mandated in O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 for protecting river corridors is establishing a natural vegetative buffer bordering each protected river. In October, 1993, a river corridor protection plan was developed as authorized in O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3 to maintain the integrity of the Yellow River.

                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPS. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in this subsection (b) and subsection (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities.

As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.); 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 113-4(b)(2); 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to the Metropolitan River Protection Act shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout steams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 113-5. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the local issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the operator owner is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Porterdale without first obtaining a permit from the City of Porterdale to perform such activity. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Porterdale and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 113-4(b) and (c). Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board. 
                  (3)  A fee as established by the city council shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  (4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 113-4(c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. 
                  (6)  Permit applicant with previous violations. 
                  a.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  b.  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof, up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this chapter or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 113-4(b) and (c). Conformance with the minimum requirements may be attained through the use of design criteria in the current issue of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state soil and water conservation commission as a guide; or through the use of alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws.

                  Sec. 113-6. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The City of Porterdale will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The City of Porterdale shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (c)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (d)  The districts or the commission, or both, shall periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission, or both, may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion and sedimentation control program. The districts or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (e)  The board, on or before December 31, 2003, shall promulgate rules and regulations setting forth the requirements and standards for certification and the procedures for decertification of a local issuing authority. The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary correction action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division may revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this chapter, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; and 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 113-5(b)(6)b. The issuing authority may call the bond or any party thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this chapter, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, notwithstanding any provisions in any city Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalties not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this chapter under county ordinances approved under this chapter shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $1,000.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Sec. 113-10. - Liability. 
                  (a)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this chapter, nor the compliance with provisions of this chapter, shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (b)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (c)  No provision of this chapter shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

                  Sec. 117-3. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within Porterdale, Georgia, are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (b)  Title and purpose. This chapter shall be known as the "Wetland Protection Ordinance of Porterdale, Georgia." The purpose of this chapter is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.

                  Sec. 117-4. - Wetland protection district boundaries. 
                  The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this chapter does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-702) 
                  Sec. 117-5. - Local development permit requirements, permissible uses (uses as of right). 
                  The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein: 
                  (1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (4)  The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  (5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (7)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the city or its designee for the following reasons: 
                  a.  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunications or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the city or their designee and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  b.  Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations. 
                  c.  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use. 
                  d.  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.

                  Sec. 117-6. - Subdivision design options in the wetland protection district. 
                  Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options: 
                  (1)  Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The city or their designee may allow a reduction in lot size provided that the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The county or its designee shall require no more than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot. 
                  (2)  Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the city or its designee will allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible.

                  Sec. 117-7. - Assessment relief. 
                  Assessors and boards of assessors shall consider wetland regulations in determining the fair market value of land. Any owner of an undeveloped wetland who has dedicated an easement or entered into a conservation program with the government or a nonprofit organization restricting activities in a wetland shall have that portion of land assessed consistent with those restrictions. Such landowner shall also be exempted from special assessment on the wetland to defray the cost of municipal improvements such as sanitary sewers, storm sewers and water mains.

                  d.  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare. 
                  e.  The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant. 
                  f.  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure. 
                  g.  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures, which are not permitted by right in the district involved. 
                  (d)  Decisions of the board of zoning appeals. 
                  (1)  In exercising its powers, the board of appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination, and to that end shall have all of the powers of the city council or building inspector and may issue or direct the issuance of a building permit. 
                  (2)  The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the building inspector, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter or to effect any variation of this chapter. 
                  (e)  Appeals, hearings and notice. 
                  (1)  Appeals to the board of zoning appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by an officer, department, board of bureau of the City of Porterdale affected by any decisions of the city council, building inspector or other city official based on this chapter. Such appeal shall be taken within 60 days, or as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the building inspector and with the board of zoning appeals a written notice of appeal specifying the ground thereof. All papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken shall forthwith be transmitted to the board of zoning appeals. 
                  (2)  The board of zoning appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of appeals or other matters referred to it, and give at least 15 days public notice thereof and due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon a hearing, any party may appeal in person, or by agent or by attorney. 
                  (f)  Stay of proceedings. An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the building inspector certifies to the board of zoning appeals, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason or acts stated in the certificate that a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of zoning appeals or by a court of record on applications, on notice to the building inspector, and on due cause shown. 
                  (g)  Rules of procedure. 
                  (1)  Meeting date. The board of zoning appeals shall prescribe the time, place, and dates of regular meetings of the board of zoning appeals. Such information shall be made available to the general public and a notice containing such information shall be posted and maintained in a conspicuous place available to the public at the regular meeting place of said board. Meetings shall be held in accordance with a regular schedule, but nothing in this subsection shall preclude an agency from canceling or postponing any regularly scheduled meeting. 
                  (2)  Official action. No official action will be taken by the board of zoning appeals on any item at any meeting that is not open to the public. 
                  (3)  Agenda preparation. 
                  a.  The agenda shall be prepared by the city clerk/treasurer with the assistance of the chair of the board of zoning appeals and the city manager. 
                  b.  The official copy of the agenda shall be prepared no less than five days in advance of the meeting date and shall be circulated to every member of the board of zoning appeals, the city manager, building inspector, and code enforcement officer. 
                  c.  A copy of the agenda shall be made available to the local press and to all persons having business with the board. 
                  (4)  Materials received after date of preparation. Material received after the date of the preparation of the agenda may be presented by a person appearing at the regular meeting of the board of zoning appeals. These persons may not present materials after the official agenda items have been considered. By unanimous vote of the member present, the board of zoning appeals may elect to amend the official agenda and permit presentation of unlisted items in any order determined by the board. No official action will be taken on any item not submitted as part of the regular agenda unless it is determined by unanimous vote of the board that such an item so affects the public health, safety, and welfare of the community that an emergency exists. 
                  (5)  Order of business. 
                  a.  Call to order by the chairperson.

When considering an appeal, the chairperson shall provide for the presentation of the technical report by the building inspector. Upon completion of the technical report presentation, the chairperson shall give the petitioner, or his agent, an opportunity to speak for the appeal. The board of zoning appeals may question the staff about the request, solicit further comment from the petitioner, or discuss the issue among themselves. Having concluded their discussion and solicitation of comments, the board will then vote on the application. Results of that vote will be forwarded to the city manager.

                  Sec. 119-42. - Building permits. 
                  (a)  Generally. It shall be unlawful for any building to be located, erected, moved, or added to, or structurally altered, without obtaining a building permit issued by the building inspector. No building permit shall be issued except in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Application for permits. 
                  (1)  An application shall be accompanied by two copies of a dimensional sketch or a to-schedule plan, signed by the owner, or his authorized agent, to include, as a minimum, the following: 
                  a.  Lot dimensions with property line monuments located thereon; 
                  b.  Shape, size, height, and location of the buildings proposed to be erected, demolished, altered, or moved, and of any buildings already on the lot, yard dimensions and use of structures, including the number of dwelling units within each structure where appropriate; 
                  c.  Easements (private and public); 
                  d.  Water courses; 
                  e.  Fences; 
                  f.  Street names and street right-of-way lines; and 
                  g.  Such other information regarding abutting property as directly affects the application. 
                  (2)  Each permit shall be conspicuously posted and displayed on the premises described in the permit during the period of construction or reconstruction. 
                  a.  If the proposed excavation, filling, construction, or movement set forth in said sketch or plan are in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, and other appropriate codes and ordinances then in effect, the building inspector shall sign and return one copy of the sketch plan to the applicant and shall issue a building permit. The building inspector shall retain one copy of the building permit and one copy of the sketch or plan for his records. 
                  b.  If the sketch or plan submitted describes work which does not conform to the requirements of this chapter, the building inspector shall not issue a building permit but shall return one copy of the sketch of plan to the applicant along with a signed refusal and shall cite the portions of these ordinances with which the submitted sketch plan does not comply. The building inspector shall retain one copy of the sketch plan and two copies of the refusal. 
                  c.  Any building permit shall automatically expire six months from the date of issuance if the person, firm, or corporation to which the certificate or permit was issued has not clearly demonstrated that the permit is being exercised for the purpose for which it was issued, or if the work so authorized is suspended or discontinued for a period of one year.

                  Sec. 119-43. - Issuance of certificate of occupancy. 
                  The building inspector shall sign and issue a certificate of occupancy if the proposed use of land or buildings, as stated on the application for such certificate and signed thereto by the owner or his appointed agent, is found to conform to the applicable provisions of this chapter and if the building, as finally constructed, complies with the sketch or plan submitted for the building permit. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-106(7)(D); Ord. of 7-9-2007(1)) 
                  Sec. 119-44. - Developments of regional impact (DRI). 
                  (a)  The Georgia Planning Act of 1989 (O.C.G.A. §§ 50-8-7.1, 50-8-7.2) authorized the department of community affairs to establish procedures for regional review of development projects that are of sufficient size that they are likely to create impacts beyond the jurisdiction in which the project will be located. The DRI review process involves the host local government, the reviewing regional development center (RDC), and other potentially affected local governments, RDCs and agencies. 
                  (b)  Thresholds are used to determine whether a proposed development is a DRI. Because positive and negative impacts of DRIs are not necessarily confined to the host local governments' jurisdictional boundaries, impacts on other jurisdictions need to be assessed. 
                  (c)  If a development project is submitted to the City of Porterdale for review, then the time deadlines imposed in by this chapter are suspended until the DRI review process is completed. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-106(8)) 
                  Sec. 119-45. - Nonconforming buildings and uses. 
                  (a)  The elimination of existing buildings and structures or uses that do not conform with this chapter is as much a subject of health, safety and general welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this chapter. It is also the intent of this chapter to administer the elimination of nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights. 
                  (b)  Any structure or use of land lawfully existing at the time of the enactment of this chapter and its amendments, but not in conformity with its use provisions, may be continued subject to the following provisions. 
                  (1)  Unsafe structures. Any structure or portion thereof declared unsafe by an appropriate council may be restored to a safe condition, provided the requirements of subsection (b)(4) of this section are met. 
                  (2)  Alterations. Any change in a lawfully existing nonconforming building, use, building site or yard area is subject to the following: 
                  a.  No lawfully existing nonconforming building can be structurally altered, except repairs on the building or installation of plumbing fixtures required by law, changing of interior partitions or interior remodeling. Improvements on a lawfully existing nonconforming building shall not exceed 50 percent of the value of the building as determined by the building inspector. 
                  b.  No lawfully existing nonconforming building or lands, except those residential dwellings needing repairs on the building or installation of plumbing fixtures as required by law, can be substantially added to, moved, or extended in any manner unless such building or land is changed to conform with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  c.  If a lawfully existing nonconforming building is moved, all nonconforming minimum yard requirements, as defined in this chapter, must be eliminated. 
                  d.  Whenever an owner of a lawfully existing residential dwelling must make repairs on or installation of plumbing fixtures which will force the location of the future addition of the dwelling nearer the lot line than permitted, the addition to the dwelling shall be allowed to extend to the existing building line but no nearer the property line than any existing portion of the dwelling. 
                  (3)  Extension. A lawfully existing nonconforming use is restricted to the lot occupied by such use as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. A nonconforming use must not be extended to include either additional building or land, except as permitted in this section, or unless the owner applies for and is granted a variance. 
                  (4)  Restoration of damaged buildings. Unless otherwise specified, a lawfully existing nonconforming structure that is destroyed (damage equals or exceeds 50 percent of the structures' replacement value, as determined by the building inspector), through no intent of the owner, may not be reconstructed or restored to the same nonconforming use except upon approval of the zoning administrator. However, residential dwellings that are nonconforming because of area and minimum yard requirements may be replaced regardless of extent of damage. 
                  (5)  Discontinuance. A lawfully existing nonconforming use which became such after the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, and which has been discontinued for a continuous period of six months, shall not be reestablished. Any future use shall be in conformance with this chapter. Where government action impedes access to land, the time of any resulting discontinuance of a nonconforming use shall not be counted towards the time periods of this section.

                  Sec. 119-64. - Authority. 
                  The council may from time to time amend the boundaries of the districts established on the official zoning map and/or the provisions set forth in this chapter. Proposed amendments shall first be submitted to the zoning commission for its recommendation. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-106(1)(A)) 
                  Sec. 119-65. - Application for amendment (rezoning application). 
                  (a)  An application for amendment must be filed with the city clerk/treasurer at least 45 days prior the zoning commission meeting at which the request will be heard. An application for amendment must contain the following information: 
                  (1)  A survey of the property prepared by the applicant showing existing and proposed structures and uses, access drives, easements, utilities, buffers, existing zoning, and any other supporting documentation required by the city clerk/treasurer to assist the zoning administration and council in rendering a decision, including concept plans. 
                  (2)  A list of adjoining property owners as shown on the tax rolls. 
                  (3)  Any additional information the applicant or the city clerk/treasurer believes to be pertinent. 
                  (b)  Additionally, the applicant, if other than the local government, must pay the required application fee, as determined by the council, to cover the administrative and advertising costs of the application and sign a statement certifying he or the owner represented by the applicant has at least a 51 percent ownership interest in the property. 
                  (c)  Once the application is submitted it cannot be amended. Incomplete applications will not be processed. 
                  (d)  The zoning administrator shall present the application and all its supporting documents, along with a written analysis of the requested zoning's impact, to the zoning commission at its regular business meeting the month in which the public hearing on the application is scheduled. The written analysis shall show that the zoning administrator has considered the proposed change in relation to the following, where applicable: 
                  (1)  What is the existing land use pattern in the area? 
                  (2)  Would approval create an isolated district designation unrelated to adjacent and nearby district designations? 
                  (3)  Would approval significantly increase or possibly overtax available infrastructure, including, but not limited to, schools, streets, and public safety services? 
                  (4)  Are the existing boundaries illogically drawn in relation to existing conditions on the property proposed for change? 
                  (5)  Would changed or changing conditions make the passage of the proposed amendment necessary? 
                  (6)  Will the proposed change adversely influence living conditions in the neighborhood? 
                  (7)  Will the proposed change create or excessively increase traffic congestion or otherwise affect public safety? 
                  (8)  Will the proposed change seriously reduce light and air to adjacent areas? 
                  (9)  Will the proposed change adversely affect property values in the adjacent area? 
                  (10)  Will the proposed change be a deterrent to the improvement or development of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations? 
                  (11)  Will the proposed change constitute a grant of special privilege to an individual owner as contrasted with the public welfare? 
                  (12)  Are there substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with its existing zoning? 
                  (13)  To what extent is the proposed change consistent with the city's comprehensive plan? 
                  (14)  What other factors, if any, should be considered in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety morality or general welfare against the right to unrestricted use of the property? 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-106(1)(B)) 
                  Sec. 119-66. - Public hearing, procedures, and rezoning standards. 
                  (a)  Public hearing required. Before enacting an amendment to this chapter, one public hearing must be held by the zoning commission. 
                  (b)  Applicant notification. The city clerk/treasurer must notify the applicant of the date, time, and place of the required public hearing. 
                  (c)  Publication of notice. Not less than 15 days, and not more than 45, days prior to the date of the public hearing, the city clerk/treasurer shall advertise the date, time, place and purpose of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in Porterdale. The notice shall also include the location of the property, the present zoning classification of the property, and the proposed zoning classification of the property. The notice shall further include a statement that any opponent of a rezoning action that has made, within two years immediately proceeding the filing of the rezoning action, campaign contributions aggregating $250.00 or more to a local government official that will consider the application, must file a disclosure with the zoning commission showing: 
                  (1)  The name and official position of the city official to whom the contribution was made; and, 
                  (2)  The dollar amount and description of each campaign contribution made to the city official. The disclosure shall be filed at least five calendar days prior to the public hearing on the zoning application. 
                  (d)  Sign. 
                  (1)  In addition to the newspaper notice, and not less than 15 days prior to the zoning commission public hearing, the zoning administrator shall cause the applicant to have posted in a conspicuous place on the lot or parcel to be rezoned, one or more signs, which shall provide adequate notice of the zoning action. Each sign shall be approximately 32 inches in height and 24 inches in width and shall provide adequate notice of the zoning action. At a minimum, the sign must contain the following information: date, time, and location or the hearing, current zoning classification and proposed zoning classification, and a telephone number interested persons can call for additional information. 
                  (2)  If, because of circumstances peculiar to the location of the property to be posted, the sign will either be inconspicuous or invisible from any well-traveled right-of-way, the sign shall be posted on the property to be rezoned and on other property in such a location that it is likely to be seen by persons potentially interested in the decision. 
                  (e)  Zoning commission action. The zoning commission shall review the record and vote on the proposed amendment to this chapter or the zoning map. The commission may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application. Within seven days of its decision, the zoning administrator shall so notify the applicant. If the zoning commission fails to act on the application within 60 days of its submission or by the next regularly scheduled zoning commission meeting (whichever is later) the application is deemed to have been approved unless the application or the matter is tabled, postponed, or withdrawn. 
                  (f)  Council action. The council shall review the record, consider the zoning amendment criteria of section 119-67, and vote on the application. The council may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application. Within seven days of its decision, the city clerk/treasurer shall so notify the applicant in writing. If the council fails to act on the application within 60 days of its submission or by its next regularly scheduled meeting, whichever is later, the application is deemed to have been approved unless the application is tabled, postponed, or withdrawn. 
                  (g)  Withdrawal. 
                  (1)  If an application for an amendment to this chapter or official zoning map is withdrawn in writing by the applicant at any time after the publication of the newspaper notice and posting of the required sign, but prior to the public hearing, then the same property may not be considered for zoning by the zoning commission until the expiration of at least 60 days immediately following the withdrawal of the rezoning application. The withdrawal must be in writing and signed by the applicant. 
                  (2)  The application will be considered to have been withdrawn if the applicant, his authorized agent or his attorney fails to appear at the zoning commission and council hearing. By withdrawing in this manner, the same property may not be considered for rezoning by the council until the expiration of at least 60 days from the date of the scheduled public hearing for which the applicant failed to appear. 
                  (h)  Denial. If an amendment to this chapter or official zoning map is denied by the council, then the same property may not be considered for rezoning until the expiration of at least six months immediately following the denial of the rezoning by the council. A tie vote with no further action during said 60-day period shall be deemed a denial of the rezoning by the council.

                  Sec. 119-67. - Zoning amendment criteria. 
                  (a)  In the adoption of an amendment to an existing zoning ordinance or amendment to the official zoning map, the zoning committee and council shall consider factors relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morals or general welfare against the right of the individual to the unrestricted use of property and must specifically consider the following factors as they may be relevant to the application: 
                  (1)  The existing land use pattern. 
                  (2)  The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts. 
                  (3)  The population density pattern and possible increase or overtaxing of the load on public facilities including, but not limited to, schools, utilities, and streets. 
                  (4)  The cost to the city and other governmental entities in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets and other public safety measures. 
                  (5)  The possible impact on the environment, including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality and water quality. 
                  (6)  Whether the proposed zoning map amendment will be a deterrent to the value or improvement or development of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations. 
                  (7)  Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing regulations. 
                  (8)  The aesthetic effect of existing and future use of the property as it relates to the surrounding area. 
                  (9)  The extent to which the proposed zoning map amendment is consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
                  (10)  The possible effect of the proposed zoning map amendment on the character of a zoning district, a particular piece of property, neighborhood, a particular area, or the community. 
                  (11)  The relation that the proposed zoning map amendment bears to the purpose of the overall zoning scheme, with due consideration given to whether or not the proposed change will help carry out the purposes of these zoning regulations. 
                  (12)  The consideration of the preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall be considered to carry great weight. 
                  (13)  In those instances in which property fronts on a major thoroughfare and also adjoins an established residential neighborhood, the factor of preservation of the residential area shall be considered to carry great weight. 
                  (b)  After hearing evidence at the zoning hearing, the zoning commission and council shall apply the evidence of the standards of review zoning amendment criteria in making their decision. It will not be required that the Porterdale Planning and Zoning Board or council to consider every criterion contained in the standards of review. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the public health, safety, morality or general welfare.

                  Sec. 119-203. - Controls for development within established one- and two-family neighborhoods (R1 and R2 zoning districts). 
                  (a)  Intent. The purpose of this section is to preserve visual compatibility between uses and to maintain property values within one- and two-family neighborhoods (R1 and R2 zoning districts) that are largely built-out and have established over time a neighborhood physical appearance and visual quality and are now experiencing new one- and two-family infill development on the remaining vacant lots. The provisions of this section are not intended to impose a pattern of regimented conformity to any specific architectural style or taste but are intended solely to prevent the location or construction of any one- or two-family dwelling structures which would substantially affect adversely the character of a neighborhood, such as reduce its desirability as a place to live, depreciate property values or otherwise be visually incompatible with the architectural characteristics of the neighborhood. The provisions of this section are intended to apply in mature subdivisions and neighborhoods that are largely built-out and not to subdivisions or developing neighborhoods where the sale of lots and development of such lots is diligently being pursued by a builder or developer. 
                  (b)  Standards. Building permits shall not be issued for one- and two-family dwelling structures located on infill lots if one or more of the following conditions exist: 
                  (1)  The proposed exterior appearance for such dwelling structure lacks form and rhythm of exterior walls and roof to the extent that the street facade is entirely flat in appearance and contradicts the established character of the neighborhood or is inappropriate in appearance with adjacent dwellings. 
                  (2)  The proposed exterior facade for such dwelling structure is to be constructed of a finished material which is visually incompatible with the quality of materials of the dwellings of the surrounding neighborhood. 
                  (3)  The proposed location of such dwelling structure on the lot does not significantly acknowledge or respect established dwelling setbacks and thereby adversely impacts the visual quality of the established development pattern. 
                  (c)  Enforcement. The building inspector upon the receipt of an application for a building permit for a one- or two-family structure located on an infill lot shall refer such application to the City of Porterdale Project Review Team (see City of Porterdale Development Regulations, Section 303, for details of the City Project Review Team) for review and appropriate action pursuant to the provisions of this section. The application referred to the Porterdale Project Review Team shall include elevation or perspective drawings adequate in detail to enable the project review team to determine if the building meets the compatibility standards as set forth in this section. The project review team shall make a determination as to whether or not the proposed building meets the standards of this section, and shall submit written notification to the city council of the project review team's determination. Upon receipt by the city council of the project review team's determination, the city council shall, at its next regular or called meeting, to be held not less than 30 days after the determination of the project review team is received by the city council, vote upon whether or not the proposed building meets the standards of this section. Where, upon affirmative vote of a majority of the city council, the city council finds that the proposed building meets the standards of this section, it shall so notify its approval to the building inspector. Where the city council finds that the proposed building does not meet the standards of this section it shall so notify the applicant and building inspector in writing setting forth its reason for such disapproval, and no building permit shall be issued based on such building design. 
                  (d)  Definition. For purposes of this section the term "infill lot" means a vacant lot located within a mature largely built-out one- or two-family subdivision or neighborhood (R1 and R2 zoning districts) where such lot is located adjacent to or across the street from a lot upon which is located a one- or two-family dwelling structure or is adjacent to a one- or two-story family dwelling structure.

                  (a)  Purpose and intent. 
                  (1)  The C-N Neighborhood Commercial District is primarily composed of service businesses or light retail establishments generally designed to serve nearby residential areas. It is the intent of this district to provide convenient commercial establishments that are primarily used by persons residing in the area. All businesses shall be those which are not objectionable by reason of odor, dust, bright lights, noise, vibration, or traffic congestion, and should, when possible, be conducted within a completely enclosed building. 
                  (2)  The site plan for such use must provide for adequate ingress and egress of vehicular traffic and will not cause safety, health or traffic problems in the area. 
                  (3)  The proposal is justified based on facts presented to indicate the need for such use, as called for in the Porterdale Comprehensive Plan. 
                  (b)  Principal uses and structures. Principal uses and structures shall be permitted in the C-N Neighborhood Commercial District in accordance with section 119-156.

                  Sec. 119-319. - Mixed Use District (MU). 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The MU District allows a combination of commercial, office, residential, recreational, and institutional uses. It is the purpose of this chapter to encourage a diversification of uses in unified projects located in proximity to major roadways and intersections and through the interrelationship of uses and structures to promote innovative and energy conscious design, efficient and effective circulation systems, a variety of housing types, and to encourage the conservation of land resources, minimization of auto travel, and the location of employment and retail centers in proximity to higher density housing. 
                  (b)  Permitted land uses and developments. Permitted land uses and development shall be established in the conditions of the ordinance governing the particular mixed use development district; specific uses may include uses designated as permitted or conditional in any of the residential, commercial, or office institutional districts. Each mixed use development district shall include a minimum of 20 percent of the total gross floor area in residential uses, 20 percent of the total gross floor area in retail commercial uses, and 20 percent of the total gross floor area in office-institutional uses. Gross floor area used for parking shall not be included in the above calculations. Gross floor area devoted to institutional, cultural, entertainment, or recreational uses may be used, on a one to one basis, to reduce the required minimum floor area of any of the three main use categories up to a maximum of 25 percent reduction. Additionally, where residential development in a proposed MU is greater than 51 percent of the total gross floor area, the remainder of the development may consist of commercial or office institutional uses or both without limitation as to percentages of gross floor area. 
                  (c)  Lot area, residential density, and yard requirements. The lot area, residential density, and yard requirements for land uses in the district are as follows: 
                  (1)  Minimum lot area. No minimum lot area is established for this district, but lot dimensions shall be sufficient to meet other requirements set forth in this section or in the conditions of the ordinance governing the particular mixed use development district. 
                  (2)  Residential density. Residential densities shall be established in the conditions of the ordinance governing the particular mixed use development but in no event shall the density exceed 25 units per acre of land in the total development excluding land which is utilized for road right-of-way purposes, and excluding right-of-way dedication for widening existing roadways, and including land within the 100-year floodplain. 
                  (3)  Maximum building site coverage. The maximum coverage of a lot by all structures shall not exceed 50 percent of the lot area and, provided that a minimum of ten percent of the land area shall be landscaped with suitable plants, trees, or shrubs, such landscaping to be maintained to the approval of the council as a condition of the use. 
                  (4)  Minimum yard requirements. 
                  a.  Front yard: None, unless adjacent to a residential district, then ten feet. 
                  b.  Side and rear yard: None, unless adjacent to a residential district, then five feet. 
                  c.  Minimum yard requirements; specific regulations and exceptions: No parking areas, internal drives, loading spaces, and structures shall be permitted within ten feet of a property line adjoining property in any residential district. Additionally, any structure exceeding 30 feet in height which adjoins property in any residential district shall be set back an additional one foot for every two feet in height above 30 feet. Greater setbacks may be required by condition if necessary to ensure compatibility with adjoining developments or uses. 
                  d.  Boundary walls or fences, six feet in height or less, are permitted within the minimum yard requirements, unless otherwise restricted in the conditions of the ordinance governing the particular mixed use development. 
                  (5)  Site design. 
                  a.  Building spacing. Adequate spacing shall be maintained between residential and nonresidential uses to ensure visual and acoustical privacy for dwelling units. Fences, insulation, walks, landscaping, and sound reducing construction techniques shall be used as appropriate for the aesthetic enhancement of the development and the privacy of its occupants, the screening of objectionable views or uses, and the reduction of noise. 
                  b.  Access, circulation. The access and circulation of a development should be designed to provide a safe and efficient system, both on and off the site. Points of access shall be designed in conformance with city regulations. The circulation system shall be designed to reduce conflicts between vehicular and pedestrian traffic, minimize impacts on adjacent properties, combine circulation and access areas, where possible, and provide adequate maneuvering areas. Points of access shall not conflict with other planned or existing access points. Where appropriate, the internal circulation system shall provide pedestrian and bicycle paths that are physically separated from vehicular traffic. 
                  c.  The design of parking areas should minimize auto noise, light and glare, and ambient air temperature. This can be accomplished through the use of sound walls, general location, use of well designed lights, and landscaping throughout the parking lot. 
                  d.  Fencing and screening. The use of any fencing or walls should be consistent with the overall design theme. Fences and wall are discourage unless needed for a specific screening, noise mitigation, or safety purposes. Where they are needed, color, material and variation of the vertical/horizontal plane are needed to blend with the site and building design. 
                  (6)  Signs. A sign program shall be required for the entire development. Such program shall include design criteria to establish an integrated and harmonious use of signs with respect to letter style, materials, color, size, shape and other design characteristics. Signage shall comply with the requirements for the office institutional zone. 
                  a.  Off-street parking and loading requirements. The minimum off-street parking and loading requirements for any use or building in a mixed use district shall not be reduced below that required for the same use in any residential, commercial, or office institutional district. These requirements may exceed minimum standards as required by conditions where determined necessary. However, the council may approved a total reduction of not more than 20 percent or the required off-street parking and loading spaces, where it has been demonstrated by study of the combined uses and customary operation of the uses that adequate parking would be provided. 
                  b.  Specific sign regulations shall be established in the conditions of the ordinance governing the mixed use development. However, in no instance shall they be less restrictive than the sign regulations for any commercial district. 
                  c.  Procedure to establish a district. The compatibility and interaction between mixed uses is to be ensured through adoption of a general development plan and specific development plans, which indicate proper orientation, desirable design character and compatible land use to provide for: 
                  1.  A more pedestrian-oriented non-automotive environment and flexibility in the design of land uses and structures than are provided by single-purpose zoning districts, included, but not limited to, shared parking. 
                  2.  Recreation areas that are most accessible to the MU districts inhabitants. 
                  3.  Environments that are more conducive to mutual interdependence in terms of living, working, shopping, entertainment and recreation. 
                  d.  In order to establish a mixed use development district through a change of zoning, the procedure shall be as follows: Application.

                  (a)  Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The wetlands within Porterdale are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
                  (2)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (3)  It is therefore necessary for Porterdale to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this section is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
                  (c)  Wetland protection district. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this section does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (d)  Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the city or its designee in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (e) of this section, or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
                  (e)  Permitted and prohibited uses. 
                  (1)  The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging, except as provided herein. 
                  a.  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  b.  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  c.  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  d.  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  e.  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  f.  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (2)  The following uses are prohibited in the wetlands protection district: 
                  a.  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
                  b.  Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills. 
                  (f)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the council or its designee for the following reasons: 
                  (1)  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the city or its designee and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  (2)  Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations, provided that they are necessary to alleviate abnormally wet or dry conditions that would have an adverse impact on the conduct of silvicultural activities if not corrected. 
                  (3)  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (e) of this section. 
                  (4)  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  (g)  Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet, with the following information: 
                  (1)  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings. 
                  (2)  A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant. 
                  (3)  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 200 feet. 
                  (4)  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
                  (5)  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet; and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent. 
                  (6)  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. 
                  (7)  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 
                  (h)  Activities to comply with the site plan. 
                  (1)  All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. The site plan may be amended only with the approval of the city or its designee. The city or its designee may require additional information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this chapter or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this section. 
                  (2)  Subdivision design options in the wetland protection district. Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options: 
                  a.  Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The city or their designee may allow a reduction in lot size provided that the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The county or its designee shall require no more than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot. 
                  b.  Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the city or its designee will allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible. 
                  (i)  Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the city or its designee. Filing fees up to a maximum established by resolution may be required to evaluate the application. This fee may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services pertaining to functional assessment, mitigation and wetland boundary determinations as deemed necessary by the city or its designee. 
                  (j)  Enforcement authority. The city clerk/treasurer is hereby established as the administrator of this section. 
                  (k)  Review procedure. The application shall be made to the city clerk/treasurer and will be reviewed within 30 days. The review period shall begin upon determination by the city clerk/treasurer that the application submitted is complete. The review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval or disapproval) by the city clerk/treasurer. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings of the city or its designee. If the review process is not completed within 30 days, the application is considered to be approved. 
                  (l)  Appeals. Decisions on permit applications made by the city clerk/treasurer may be appealed to the council. The appeal must be made within 30 days of the decision rendered by the building inspector. A public hearing shall be held for appeals. Public announcement of the hearing shall be printed in a local newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Any person may offer testimony at the hearing. The decision of the council may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  (1)  Duration of permit validity. 
                  (2)  If construction described in the development permit has not commenced within 12 months from the date of issuance, the permit shall expire. 
                  (3)  If construction described in the development permit is suspended or abandoned after work has commenced, the permit shall expire 12 months after the date that work ceased. 
                  (4)  Written notice of the pending expiration of the development permit shall be issued by the building inspector. 
                  (m)  Monitoring and enforcement. The city or its designee, its agent, officers and employees shall have authority to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing their duties under this section and may make or cause to be made such examinations, surveys or sampling as the city or its designee deems necessary. 
                  (1)  All enforcement and monitoring activities conducted by the city or its designee that involves entrance to privately owned land by the city or its designee shall be preceded by written notification to the landowner. Said notification shall be issued at least seven days prior to the activities specified in the notification. 
                  (2)  The city clerk/treasurer shall have authority to enforce this section; issue permits hereunder; and address violations or threatened violations hereof by issuance of violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator. 
                  (3)  Law enforcement officials or other officials having police powers shall have authority to assist the city clerk/treasurer in enforcement. 
                  (4)  The city clerk/treasurer shall have authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this section. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  The city or its designee may require a bond in an amount of $1,000.00 and with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions set forth in the permit. The particular amount and the conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of this section. In the event of a breach of any condition of any such bond, the city or its designee may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and execution. 
                  (n)  Penalties. 
                  (1)  Any person who commits, takes part in or assists in any violation of any provision of this section may be fined not more than $2,500.00 for each offense. Each violation shall be a separate offense and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense. 
                  (2)  When a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this section, the violator may be required to remove the structure at the discretion of the city or its designee. 
                  (3)  When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this section, the violator may be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation, as far as practicable, at the discretion of the city or its designee. 
                  (4)  If the city or its designee discovers a violation of this section that also constitutes a violation of any provision of the Clean Water Act, as amended, the city or its designee shall issue written notification of the violation to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the landowner. 
                  (5)  Suspension, revocation. The city or its designee may suspend or revoke a permit if it finds that the applicant has not complied with the conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of the work set forth in the permit. The city or its designee shall cause notice of denial, issuance, conditional issuance, revocation or suspension of a permit to be published in a daily newspaper having a broad circulation in the area where the wetland is located. 
                  (o)  Judicial review. 
                  (1)  Jurisdiction. All final decisions of the city or its designee concerning denial, approval or conditional approval of a special permit shall be reviewable in the county superior court. 
                  (2)  Alternative actions. Based on these proceedings and the decision of the court, the county or its designee may, within the time specified by the court, elect to: 
                  a.  Institute negotiated purchase or condemnation proceedings to acquire an easement or fee interest in the applicant's land; 
                  b.  Approve the permit application with lesser restrictions or conditions (i.e., grant a variance); or 
                  c.  Institute other appropriate actions ordered by the court that fall within the jurisdiction of the court. 
                  (p)  Amendments. These regulations and the generalized wetland map may from time to time be amended in accordance with procedures and requirements in the general statutes and as new information concerning wetland locations, soils, hydrology, flooding or plant species peculiar to wetlands becomes available. 
                  (q)  Assessment relief. Assessors and boards of assessors shall consider wetland regulations in determining the fair market value of land. Any owner of an undeveloped wetland who has dedicated an easement or entered into a conservation program with the government or a nonprofit organization restricting activities in a wetland shall have that portion of land assessed consistent with those restrictions. Such landowner shall also be exempted from special assessment on the wetland to defray the cost of municipal improvements such as sanitary sewers, storm sewers and water mains. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-104(1)(A)) 
                  Sec. 119-343. - RIV River Corridor Protection. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. 
                  (1)  This section provides for the protection of river corridors and the regulation of activities in or adjacent to those corridors; provides for the powers and duties of Porterdale and other governmental entities; provides for goals, guidelines, practices, procedures, policies, rules, and regulations; provides for minimum standards for regulated activities within river corridors and their buffers which natural resources of the county are of vital importance to this county and its citizens; provides for a review of decision; provides for hearings and judicial review; provides for enforcement; prohibits certain activities or actions; provides for civil and other penalties; repeals conflicting ordinances; and for other purposes. 
                  (2)  The State of Georgia has determined that its river corridors are of vital importance in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors are fragile natural resources subject to flood, erosion, soil-bearing capacity limitation, and other natural and human induced hazards. In their natural state, they serve multiple functions for pollution control, aquifer recharge and discharge, storage and passage of floodwater, and erosion and sedimentation control, as well as wildlife habitat, education, scientific study, open space and recreation, and scenic and aesthetic beauty. 
                  (3)  The Georgia Planning Act of 1989 (O.C.G.A. §§ 50-8-7.1, 50-8-7.2) provides for the development of coordinated and comprehensive planning by municipal and county governments. Such comprehensive plans shall consider the natural resources, environments, and vital areas within the jurisdiction of the local governments. Additionally, O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 authorizes the department of natural resources to develop minimum planning standards and procedures for the protection of river corridors in the state and requires local government to use these minimum standards in developing and implementing local comprehensive plans. The method mandated in O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 for protecting river corridors is establishing a natural vegetative buffer bordering each protected river. In October, 1993, Porterdale developed a river corridor protection plan, as authorized in O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3, to maintain the integrity of the Yellow River. 
                  (b)  Applicability. The standards and procedures detailed in this section shall be applicable to incorporated Porterdale and all state-owned or -administered land. 
                  (c)  Protection criteria. 
                  (1)  A 100 foot natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained adjacent to the river corridor except as otherwise provided herein. 
                  (2)  Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited within the river corridor, except as provided in subsection (d)(1) of this section. 
                  (3)  The natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land-disturbing activity within the river corridor. 
                  (d)  Permitted activities within the river corridor. 
                  (1)  Detached single-family dwellings and its customary appurtenances shall be permitted within the buffer subject to the following conditions: 
                  a.  The dwelling and its customary appurtenances shall comply with all local zoning regulations, building codes and any other local regulations. 
                  b.  The dwelling must be located on a tract of land containing at least two acres. Where a tract includes any portion of the protected river, the area between the river banks cannot be counted towards the two acre minimum tract size. 
                  c.  Only one dwelling is permitted on each two acre or larger tract. 
                  d.  Septic tanks serving the dwelling may be located within the buffer. 
                  e.  Septic tank drainfields shall not be located within the buffer. 
                  (2)  Construction of road crossings and utility crossings within the river corridor shall be permitted provided that the construction meets all requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), as amended, and chapter 113. 
                  (3)  Industrial and commercial land uses existing prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived are exempt from the protection criteria of this section, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, provided that: 
                  a.  The use of the river corridor does not impair the drinking quality of the river water; and 
                  b.  The activity within the river corridor meets all state and federal environmental rules and regulations. 
                  (4)  Timber production and harvesting provided that the activity is consistent with the Georgia Forestry Commission's best management practices and the activity does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (5)  Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8. 
                  (6)  Waste-water treatment. 
                  (7)  Recreational usage consistent with either the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river-dependent recreation. 
                  (8)  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  (9)  Agricultural production and management provided that the activity is consistent with the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission's best management practices and the activity does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Clean Water Act, as amended. Additionally, the activity must be consistent with all other state and federal laws and Georgia Department of Agriculture regulations. 
                  (10)  Any other uses permitted by the department of natural resources or under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (e)  Prohibited activities within the river corridor. 
                  (1)  Hazardous waste or solid waste landfills, or construction and demolition (CandD) landfills. 
                  (2)  Commercial or industrial uses that involve handling hazardous materials other than wastes. 
                  (3)  Handling areas for the receiving and storage of hazardous waste. 
                  (4)  Construction within the river corridor is prohibited unless permitted in subsection (d) of this section. 
                  (5)  Surface mining activities. 
                  (f)  Permits. 
                  (1)  All persons desiring to undertake a permitted activity within a river corridor as mapped on the official zoning map must first obtain a permit from Porterdale. 
                  (2)  Permits shall be issued only if the activity is in compliance with county regulations and other applicable state, federal, and local regulations. The county shall impose conditions on any permit necessary to ensure that any adverse impacts upon the functions and values of the river corridor are prevented or kept to a minimum. Permits shall be valid for six months. If the activity has not been completed but substantial progress has been made, one six month extension to the permit may be granted by Porterdale or its designee. 
                  (3)  Permits may be revoked for failure to comply with regulatory guidelines, including conditions attached to the permit. 
                  (g)  Variance. 
                  (1)  A variance may be approved if such approval is not contrary to the public interest and where, because of the special characteristics of the property and the activity, a literal enforcement of provisions of this section will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship. However, the spirit of this section must be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; provided that the variance, if granted, will not result in damage to the river corridor. 
                  (2)  An application for variance should be filed with the city clerk/treasurer according to article II, division 4, of this chapter. Newton County shall process the application according to article II, division 4, of this chapter. However, only the following criteria shall be used to determine whether the variance should be granted. 
                  a.  The application of this section to this particular property will result in unnecessary hardship; 
                  b.  It is proven that no damage to the river corridor will result from the requested activity; and 
                  c.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this section. Proof of no damage to the river corridor must be supplied by the applicant as deemed necessary by the board, including, but not limited to, an environmental impact statement. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-104(2)(A)) 
                  Sec. 119-344. - Open Space Design District (OSD). 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. 
                  (1)  The purpose of this district is to encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements under a unified development plan rather than under lot-by-lot regulation. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities, and flexibility in design. The city gains the advantages of variety in building types, compatibility of uses and optimum community development. Review and approval of the development plan by the Porterdale Council provides an opportunity to ensure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood in which the development is located. 
                  (2)  The OSD District is not intended to encourage greater density of development, but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning and to ensure the provision of park and recreation facilities for the use of the occupants of the development. 
                  (3)  The purpose of the OSD District is to: 
                  a.  Allow for greater flexibility and creativity in the design of residential development; 
                  b.  Encourage the permanent preservation of open space, agricultural and forestry land, and other natural resources; 
                  c.  Maintain Porterdale's small town character and land use patterns that preserve open space and farmlands; 
                  d.  Protect scenic vistas from development which would destroy or obstruct such vistas; 
                  e.  Preserve unique and significant natural, historical and archeological resources; 
                  f.  Facilitate the construction and maintenance of streets, utilities and public services in a more economical and efficient manner; 
                  g.  Protect existing and potential drinking water supplies; and 
                  h.  Encourage a less sprawling form of development. 
                  These standards are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation, or variety, but rather to assist in focusing on design principles which can produce creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual appearance within the city, preserve taxable values, and promote the public health, safety, and welfare. 
                  (b)  Types of open space development. Residential development: Parcel or site shall be at least ten acres. 
                  (c)  General design standards. 
                  (1)  The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state, insofar as practicable, by minimizing tree and soil removal. Conflicts between development and the rural environment should be minimized. For example, tucking house lots and driveways into wooded lots is recommended. 
                  (2)  The orientation of individual building sites shall be such as to maintain maximum natural topography and cover. Topography, tree cover, and natural drainageways shall be treated as fixed determinants of road and lot configuration rather than as malleable elements that can be changed to follow a preferred development scheme. 
                  (3)  Streets shall be designed and located in such a manner as to maintain and preserve natural topography, cover, significant landmarks, and trees; to minimize cut and fill; and to preserve and enhance views and vistas on or off the subject parcel. All streets within the OSD development shall be public streets. At least one major access with safe and adequate connections to an existing public street must be provided for every 100 dwelling units proposed in the OSD development. 
                  (4)  Maintain or create a buffer of natural vegetation of at least 100 feet in width adjacent to surface waters and wetlands. 
                  (5)  Maintain unblocked or uninterrupted scenic views and vistas, particularly as seen from public roads or as designated in the Porterdale Comprehensive Plan. For example, a 100 foot deep no build buffer is recommended to screen homes from the street and vice versa. 
                  (6)  The removal or disruption of historic, traditional or significant uses, structures, or architectural elements shall be minimized insofar as practicable. 
                  (7)  Protect the habitat areas of species listed as rare or endangered by the department of natural resources, freshwater wetlands and natural heritage inventory. 
                  (8)  The open space shall be reasonably contiguous, coherent, and, if the tract of land abuts adjacent open space or other permanently protected open space, it shall connect with that adjacent or permanently protected open space. 
                  (d)  Density. 
                  (1)  The maximum number of dwelling units allowed shall equal the number of dwelling units which could reasonably be expected to be developed on the property under the underlying zoning district, in full conformance with zoning, subdivision regulations, health codes, and other local, state and federal requirements. 
                  (2)  Within the OSD development the following percentages of the total land area shall be devoted to the specified uses: a maximum of 50 percent for residential use which shall include streets, parking areas, private open space and courts which abut and primarily service residences or groups of residences, but shall not include the usable open space. 
                  (e)  Minimum dimensional requirements for residential lots. 
                  (1)  The building envelope shall not exceed 40 percent of the lot or 20,000 square feet, whichever is less. In the design process, the most suitable areas for development should be shown. Areas beyond these building envelopes should be restricted against development. Building envelope lines should not be drawn into wetlands, floodplains, or steep slopes (slopes in excess of 25 percent) and shall not include the tops of ridge lines. Building envelopes shall avoid open fields as much as possible. Building envelopes shall be located on the edges of fields and in wooded areas to minimize the visual impact of development. 
                  (2)  Maximum total lot disturbance shall not exceed 50 percent of the lot area or 25,000 square feet, whichever is less. Site disturbance shall include all areas disturbed for the purpose of constructing buildings and structures as well as all graded areas and lawns. The total shall include disturbed areas both inside and outside the building envelope. 
                  (3)  Minimum frontage should not be less than 75 feet. Lots located on the turnaround of a cul-de-sac shall have a minimum of 40 feet of street frontage providing a front building line is designated on the site plan for such a lot and the width of the lot at this building line is at least equal to the minimum frontage requirement. 
                  (4)  The front or rear face of a dwelling unit shall be not less than 50 feet from the front or rear face of another dwelling unit. The side face of a single-family dwelling shall be not less than 20 feet from the side face of another such building and not less than 40 feet from the front or rear face of another such building. 
                  (5)  No dwelling unit shall be situated so as to face the rear of another dwelling unit within the subdivision unless terrain differences or screening will provide effective visual separation. 
                  (6)  The front, side and rear setback lines shall be shown on the final plat. 
                  (7)  Buffer areas. All single-family dwellings and accessory structures shall be located a minimum of 50 feet from adjacent tracts of land. 
                  (8)  Accessory uses. All accessory uses shall be located to the rear of the front building line but no closer than ten feet to the rear lot line. 
                  (f)  Requirements for open space. It is the intent of these regulations that open space be comprised of buildable and non-buildable lands. Land so designated as open space shall be in a location and configuration that relates to the ultimate purpose of the open space (i.e., outdoor recreation, landscape protection, habitat protection, etc.). Development should be designed around these natural features. 
                  (1)  Not less than 50 percent of the total area of the tract of land to be developed as an OSD shall be dedicated as common open space. 
                  (2)  At least 50 percent of the required open space shall be forested, preferably hardwood, and shall be dedicated and used for open space. 
                  (3)  Up to 50 percent of the required open space may be composed of land that is pasture/agricultural land. 
                  (4)  No more than 20 percent of the required open space may be in land that is located in a floodplain or wetlands. 
                  (5)  Rights-of-way for streets, above ground utility easements, drainage easements, and detention ponds shall be excluded from land considered for open space. 
                  (6)  If the development is to be built in phases, 50 percent of the open space of the entire development must be shown on the Phase I final plat and must be deeded to the homeowners' association or other entity responsible for its maintenance and payment of taxes. This requirement must be met prior to approval of the final plat. 
                  (g)  Design standards for public roads. It is the intent of this section to minimize the amount of site disruption caused by roadways and the associated grading required for their construction. 
                  (1)  Streets shall follow existing contours to minimize the extent of cuts and fills. 
                  (2)  Maximum centerline radius for residential collectors shall be 150 feet. However, when topography or aesthetic design concerns prohibit streets which typically take right angle turns followed by an intervening straight segment, reverse curves can be used (no intervening straight segment is required). 
                  (3)  In order to stimulate intra-neighborhood accessibility, all streets within the subdivision shall interconnect as much as possible. Where the interconnection of a street would not promote the purpose of the OSD (subsection (a) of this section), non-interconnected streets (cul-de-sacs) are permissible. A cul-de-sac shall not serve more than 25 single-family dwellings and shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length. Should a cul-de-sac be desired, a turning loop is recommended. Turning loops should include a quarter-acre island of undisturbed native vegetation. The area included in an island that is at least one-quarter acre of undisturbed vegetation shall be counted towards required open space. Turning loops should not be perfectly circular. If the developer demonstrates that a turning loop is for topographic reasons not a feasible development option, a circular, totally paved, cul-de-sac with a radius of 30 feet shall be permitted. An off-center turnaround is preferred as it creates visual variety and improves turning ease for the driver. The right-of-way for a cul-de-sac or turning loop shall extend ten feet beyond the edge of the street pavement. 
                  (4)  Every dwelling shall have direct access to a public street. 
                  (5)  A 25-mile per hour design speed shall be used to establish criteria for minimum grade, maximum grade, minimum tangent length between reverse curves and maximum grade within 50 feet of an intersection. 
                  (h)  Required improvements. 
                  (1)  Water supply. Each dwelling unit shall be connected to a public or community water system approved by the health department. 
                  (2)  Sewerage. All sewerage systems within the development shall meet the requirements of the health department. 
                  (3)  Utilities. All utilities within the subdivision shall be underground. 
                  (4)  Stormwater runoff. The volume and velocity of stormwater runoff after development shall not exceed the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff prior to development. 
                  (5)  Storm drainage system. The developer shall provide a storm drainage system for the subdivision which shall be of sufficient size and design to collect, carry off, and dispose of all predictable surface water runoff within the development and shall be so constructed as to conform with the statutes, ordinances, and regulations of the State of Georgia and Porterdale, Georgia. Proposed storm drainage systems shall be approved by the Porterdale Zoning Administrator. 
                  (6)  Fire hydrant. The developer shall provide a fire hydrant. 
                  (i)  Ownership of the open space. 
                  (1)  All of the land in an OSD shall be owned initially by an individual, by a corporation or by some legal entity. The owner may sell to another person a portion of the OSD to be developed by said person, provided a preliminary plat, in accordance with the original OSD of said portion of the property, has been approved by the Porterdale Council and a performance bond, to ensure construction of streets, has been posted for said property. Individual lots or units in an OSD may be sold after a final plat has been recorded with the lots and units subject to private deed covenants that ensure the continuance of the OSD as originally approved and planned. 
                  (2)  The developer must submit to the Porterdale Council proposed articles of association or incorporation which establish the homeowners' association. Said document must be approved in writing by the Porterdale Council prior to approving said development. The articles of association or incorporation shall be reviewed by the city attorney prior to any action by the city. Any proposed changes in said articles shall require the prior written approval of Porterdale Council. 
                  (3)  Membership in the homeowners' association shall be mandatory for property owners and made a required covenant in all deeds issued or passed. The association shall provide voting and use rights in the open space areas when applicable and charge dues or levy assessments to cover expenses which may include the maintenance of the common areas, open space areas, improvements, rights-of-way, utilities, etc. Such association shall be responsible for the perpetuation, maintenance, and function of all common lands, uses, and facilities. The homeowner's association shall be deemed to have assented to allow Porterdale to perform maintenance of the open space and related facilities if the homeowner's association fails to provide adequate maintenance. If the homeowner's association fails to provide adequate maintenance, Porterdale shall first provide 15 days written notice to the homeowner's association as to the maintenance that is lacking, and, if the association fails to complete said work, the city may perform the work. The owner of each lot or dwelling unit in the OSD shall be deemed to have assented to the city filing a lien against each lot or dwelling unit in the OSD for the full cost of such maintenance, which liens shall be released upon payment to the city of same. Each individual deed, as well as the articles of incorporation, shall include a provision to carry these provisions into effect. Documents creating such corporation shall be submitted to the Porterdale Council for approval and shall be recorded by the clerk of court. 
                  (4)  All lands and improvements, including any improvements to the open space, shall be described and identified as to location, size, use, and control in a restrictive covenant. These restrictive covenants shall be written so as to run with the land and become a part of the deed of each lot or dwelling unit within the development. All open space shall be deemed a common area and may be used by all residents in the development. A pro rata portion of the open space shall be included with each residential or commercial lot in the OSD for tax purposes only. Taxes on the open space shall be paid by the individual homeowner rather than the homeowners' association. 
                  (5)  Such restrictive covenants and the association shall continue in effect so as to control the availability of facilities for their intended function, and to protect the development from additional unplanned densities and use. Such association shall not be dissolved, nor shall such association dispose of any common, open space or natural land by sale or otherwise, except to an organization or association conceived and organized to own and maintain such areas, without prior written consent of the Porterdale Council. 
                  (6)  Any and all open space lands shall be held in common ownership by the dwelling unit owners. All open space, however, has been set aside to lessen the environmental and visual impact of the subdivision on the rural landscape. Therefore, any change in the open space, other than to maintain it in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the approved final plan, requires prior written approval of Porterdale. 
                  (j)  Procedural requirements. 
                  (1)  Formal application for conceptual plan approval of the project shall be submitted to the Porterdale Council. 
                  (2)  The applicant shall submit to the Porterdale Council the following information to determine whether the proposed development meets the required standards and shall pay any required fees. 
                  a.  A separate sketch plan showing the maximum number of dwelling units which could reasonably be expected to be developed on the property under the underlying zoning district, in full conformance with zoning, health codes, and other local, state and federal requirements. 
                  b.  A topographic and boundary line map with five foot contour lines that shows the edge of the hardwood forest, wetlands, floodplains, identified scenic views, historic or archeological sites, and environmentally sensitive habitats. 
                  c.  The relationship of the proposed development to surrounding development and roads. 
                  d.  A preliminary sketch site plan showing approximate locations of proposed streets, road, and parking, where appropriate, proposed locations of lots, types and locations of proposed buildings, and the locations of proposed public or common open spaces and the amount of acreage developed to specific uses. 
                  e.  Any statistical tabulations required to show that the proposed development meets the specific requirements of an OSD as specified in these regulations. 
                  (3)  If the conceptual plan is approved by the council, the developer shall thereafter submit a preliminary plat containing all the information required by these regulations and any other applicable regulations of Porterdale for any part or section of the land for which he expects to seek subdivision approval and shall pay any required fees. The preliminary plat shall be submitted to Porterdale Council. 
                  (4)  Approval of the preliminary plat shall be by the council. 
                  (5)  Initiation of improvements shall proceed in accordance with the Porterdale Subdivision Regulations. 
                  (6)  Request for final plat approval shall be in accordance with the Porterdale Subdivision Regulations.

                  Sec. 119-364. - Principal buildings. 
                  (a)  In all commercial zones, more than one principal building containing a permitted or conditional use may be erected on a single lot or tract of land provided that all yard and other space requirements of this chapter are met for each structure as though it were on an individual lot. Further, in the agricultural zone, more than one principal building housing a permitted single-family residential use may be erected on a single-family residential lot or tract of land provided all yard and other space requirements of this chapter are met for each structure as though it were on an individual lot. 
                  (b)  No residential parcel of land shall contain more than one principal building. Accessory buildings may be allowed. If a parcel currently contains more than one principal building, that parcel and those buildings shall be considered as a "nonconforming building or use" subject to the provisions of section 119-45 of this Code. 
                  Any division of land or the creation of any lot within the city limits is subject to and shall be governed by the City of Porterdale Development Regulations set out at chapter 115 of this Code, and must be reviewed and approved by the city prior to recording in the county land records. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-102(6); Ord. of 4-4-2016, § 2) 
                  Sec. 119-365. - Minimum distance between buildings. 
                  The following minimum distances between buildings are required unless otherwise specified within this chapter. 
                  (1)  The minimum distance between principal uses located on the same lot or parcel: 
                  a.  Front to front arrangement: 40 feet. 
                  b.  Front to rear arrangement: 50 feet. 
                  c.  Rear to rear arrangement: 30 feet. 
                  d.  Side to side arrangement: 20 feet. 
                  e.  All other combinations: 20 feet. 
                  (2)  There shall be a distance of not less than 20 feet between a principal and accessory building located on the same lot or parcel. 
                  (3)  No accessory building shall be located closer than 20 feet to any lot line in any zoning district. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-102(7)) 
                  Sec. 119-366. - Building design and materials. 
                  The "small town character" of Porterdale is what distinguishes the town and village from other more generic suburban area. The intent of these requirements is to maintain and preserve the community's sense of identity and the integrity of areas both inside and outside the historic district while allowing for improvements to the housing stock; maximizing the potential for incremental reversals of past infractions and errors; all resulting in the improvement of the quality of life for all residents. The city can accomplish these goals by regulating structures that may impact adjoining properties and the community at large. 
                  Only by maintaining the historic integrity of the original village and the quality of new development can the city as a whole preserve its underlying character. To protect these critical elements, the following standards shall apply: 
                  (1)  Historic district. All developments within the designated historic districts shall conform to the standards of that district. 
                  (Reference: Porterdale Historic Preservation Standards.) 
                  (2)  All areas within the city limits. In the event of conflicting standards, resolution shall be in the hierarchy of: (1) health and safety, (2) historic preservation, (3) supplemental regulations. 
                  a.  Commercial buildings. 
                  1.  Exterior walls shall be red brick or other material compatible with the style of the existing downtown commercial district. 
                  2.  Doors and fenestrations shall be regular and symmetrical, and compatible with the style of the existing downtown commercial district. Materials may be subject to specific stipulations by the city council. 
                  3.  Roof lines shall be subject to approval by the city council. 
                  b.  Residential buildings and fences. 
                  1.  Exterior walls shall be brick or stone facade, or wood paneling. Hard material (i.e., "Hardy Plank" or similar durable material) may substitute for wood paneling. Composite paneling, hollow siding (aluminum or vinyl), and other similar materials are prohibited. 
                  2.  Roofs shall be asphalt shingles or similar modern material. Metal roofs may be used if specifically approved by the city council. 
                  3.  If original doors or doorframes are replaced, replacement doorway will be a minimum of 36 inches wide to provide handicapped accessibility. The goal of this requirement is to facilitate the evolution of the housing stock into a community that accommodates all ages and abilities, and allows residents to "age in place". 
                  4.  In order to be consistent with traditional Porterdale housing styles, floor elevations shall average a minimum 24 inches above the surrounding ground elevation. This may be achieved by crawlspace type construction, backfilling within a perimeter foundation, or by using monolithic turn-down footings around slabs. 
                  5.  At least one entrance into each residence shall be handicapped accessible. 
                  6.  Front yard fences, gates, and arbors are prohibited. Border fences are allowed behind the front face of the residence. Fencing facing public streets should be no higher than 42 inches. Fencing attached to the structure must be located behind the front edge of the side windows closest to the front face of the residence, or one third of the depth of the house from the front face, but shall be a least 12 feet behind the face of the residence. Privacy and containment fences shall be in the rear of residences and may be no more than six feet high. Fence material must be compatible with the style and structure of the residence and the neighborhood.

                  Sec. 119-367. - Building envelope. 
                  (a)  The building envelope shall not exceed 15 feet beyond the building footprint with the exception of one 15-foot wide construction entrance to the site and the location of underground utilities. All trees outside the building envelope shall be protected. The construction entrance must be the same location as the finished driveway. Underground utilities should be installed adjacent to the construction entrance. However, if it is impossible, no more than a four-foot trenching entrance is permitted. Areas beyond building envelopes should be restricted against development. Building envelope lines should not be drawn into wetlands, floodplains, or steep slopes (slopes in excess of 25 percent) and shall not include the tops of ridge lines. 
                  (b)  Existing features that would add value and quality of life benefits to residential development or to the community as a whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change of grade of the land affected until approval of the preliminary plat has been granted and appropriate permits issued. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and all trees, where required, shall be welled and protected against change of grade. The sketch plat shall show the number and location of existing trees as required by these regulations and shall further indicate all those marked for retention.

                  Sec. 119-368. - Protection of root system and tree protection zones. 
                  The root system of trees can easily extend two to three times beyond the dripline of the tree canopy. The root system within the dripline region is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Disturbance within this zone can directly affect a tree's chances for survival. To protect these critical root zones the following standards shall apply: 
                  (1)  Use of tree save islands and stands are encouraged rather than the protection on individual (non-specimen) trees scattered throughout a site. 
                  a.  This will facilitate overall site organization as related to tree protection. The protection zone of specimen trees or stands of trees or otherwise designated tree save areas shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy. A specimen tree is defined as any tree in fair or better condition which equals or exceeds the following diameter sizes: 
                  1.  Large hardwoods, i.e., oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, etc.: 30 inches DBH (diameter at breast height). 
                  2.  Large softwoods, e.g., pines, evergreens, etc.: 30 inches DBH. 
                  3.  Small trees, e.g., dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.: ten inches DBH. 
                  b.  Any tree in fair or better condition should meet the following minimum standards: 
                  1.  A life expectancy of greater than 15 years. 
                  2.  A relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay or hollow, and less than 20 percent radial trunk dieback. 
                  3.  No major insect or pathological problem. 
                  c.  Layout of the project site utility and grading plans should accommodate the required tree protection zones. Utilities must be placed outside tree protection zones. 
                  d.  Construction site activities, such as parking, material storage, concrete washouts, burn pit placement, and vehicle and equipment maintenance, shall be located outside tree protection zones and arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protection zones. 
                  e.  No disturbance shall occur within the protection zone of specimen trees or stands of trees without prior approval of the zoning administrator. 
                  f.  To avoid soil compaction, vehicular traffic is not to be permitted in the root or tree protection zone. If vehicular traffic must occur in the root zone, minimize soils compaction by applying a four-inch to 12-inch layer of coarse mulch in the traffic area. 
                  g.  Active tree protection tree fencing shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely surrounding the critical root zones of all specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protection zones, prior to any land disturbance. 
                  h.  These fences will be a minimum of four feet high constructed in post and rail configuration. A two-inch by four-inch post and a double one-inch by four-inch rail is recommended. Four foot orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing is also acceptable. This fencing shall remain in place until the final inspection is issued on said project by the building inspector. 
                  i.  Passive forms of tree protection may be utilized to designate tree save areas which are remote from areas of land disturbance. These areas must be surrounded with continuous rope or flagging (heavy mil minimum four inch wide). All passive tree protection must be accompanied by "keep out" signage. 
                  j.  All specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protection zones, must be protected from the construction processes that cause sedimentation, erosion, flooding, and other conditions resulting in tree damage. 
                  1.  Silt screening must be placed along the outer uphill edge of tree protection zones at the land disturbance interface. 
                  2.  Silt screening should be backed by 12 gauge, two-inch by four-inch wire mesh fencing in areas of steep slope (a grade of 2:1 or greater). 
                  3.  All erosion control must comply with chapter 113. 
                  k.  All tree fencing and erosion control barriers must be installed prior to any land disturbance and maintained throughout the land disturbance process and the building construction. The fencing shall not be removed until landscaping is installed. 
                  (2)  Shade trees planted by developer. As a requirement of subdivision approval, where the development is not naturally wooded, the applicant shall plant shade trees on the property within the subdivision. Trees are to be planted within five feet of the right-of-way of the roads within and abutting the subdivision. One tree shall be planted for every 40 feet of frontage along each road. New trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter (measured 12 inches above the ground level) of not less than two inches. Only long-lived shade trees shall be planted. 
                  (3)  Maintenance of planted trees. The developer shall be responsible for replacing any tree that dies within three years of the completion of the entire development or, if a phased development, within three years of the completion of the phase in which the now dead tree was planted. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-102(10)) 
                  Sec. 119-369. - Curbcuts, vision and pedestrian clearance. 
                  The requirements for controlling curbcuts and maintaining vision and pedestrian clearance shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  Curbcuts. No curbcut shall be less than nine feet nor greater than 30 feet in length unless the property will primarily serve tractor-trailer traffic. Single-family residential curbcuts shall not exceed 12 feet. Except in residential zoning districts, no curbcut shall be closer than 100 feet to another curbcut or access point. At street intersections, no curbcut or other access point shall be located closer to the intersection than is necessary to serve the property, but in no case shall be closer than 50 feet from the intersecting point of the two street right-of-way or property lines involved (or such lines extended in case of a rounded corner), whichever is the least restrictive. Adjacent properties are strongly encouraged to utilize shared parking arrangements as outlined in section 119-461 in an effort to minimize curbcuts and impervious parking area. A permit must be obtained from the Georgia Department of Transportation before curbcuts or any other point of access is authorized onto state-owned highway rights-of-way from abutting property. 
                  (2)  Vision and pedestrian clearance. In all zoning districts, no fence, wall, shrubbery, sign, marquee or other obstruction to vision between the heights of 1.5 feet and ten feet from the ground level is permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two streets or railroad lines, of a street intersection with a railroad line, or of curbcuts or driveways. In order to provide safe passage for both vehicles and pedestrians, no fence or wall shall be located closer than 36 inches to the edge of any street or alley.

                  Sec. 119-370. - Classification and function of streets. 
                  All streets in Porterdale, Georgia, are divided into the following classes. 
                  (1)  Arterials. An arterial is a high-volume street that serves no residences. Its function is to conduct traffic between communities and activity centers and to connect communities to major state and interstate highways. 
                  (2)  Collector. As the principal traffic artery within residential or commercial areas, the collector carries relatively high traffic volumes and conveys traffic from arterial streets to lower-order streets. Its function is to promote the free flow of traffic; as such, communities should not encourage parking or residences along a collector. The collector's secondary function is to serve abutting land uses. A collector street may also accommodate public transit such as buses. 
                  (3)  Subcollector. The subcollector provides passage to access streets and conveys traffic to collectors. Like the access street, the subcollector provides frontage and access to residential lots but also carries some through-traffic to lower-order access streets. The subcollector is a relatively low-volume street. Subcollectors usually serve more dwellings than an access street and carry a small volume of through-traffic to one or more access streets. 
                  (4)  Residential streets and access roads. Sometimes called a place or lane, residential streets and access roads are designed to conduct traffic between dwelling units and higher order streets. This category includes short streets, cul-de-sac, and courts. Access streets are so designated due to their lack of through-traffic and for the fact that they serve only a few dwelling units or businesses. 
                  (5)  Alleys . Alleys in the city are considered to be public rights-of-way. All rules and regulation applicable to public rights-of-way shall apply to alleys. 
                  (6)  Redundant access . In the interest of public health and safety, any public street or system of streets serving 20 or more residential units or commercial entities, or generating more than 200 average daily traffic trips (ADT) shall have more than one connection to a collector street. (Reverence: "Residential Streets," 3rd Edition, a joint publication of Urban Land Institute, Nat'l Assoc. of Home Builders, ASCE and ITE.) 
                  (7)  Trails and pathways . The City of Porterdale is committed to the concept of a walkable community. New development or redevelopment projects must be designed to facilitate convenient access for pedestrians, bicycles, and wheelchairs. Where multi-use trails, pathways, or greenway are planned by the city, appropriate easement or rights-of-way must be provided as a condition of development. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-105(5); Ord. of 4-4-2016, §§ 8—10) 
                  Sec. 119-371. - Storage and parking of recreational vehicles, trailers, and other vehicles. 
                  Commercial vehicles and trailers of all types, including travel, boat, camping and hauling, shall not be parked or stored on any lot or parcel in any zoning district except in accordance with the following requirements: 
                  (1)  No commercial vehicle used for hauling explosives, gasoline or liquefied petroleum products is permitted. 
                  (2)  Recreational vehicles, hauling trailers, or boat trailers are permitted if parked or stored at least 12 feet behind the front yard building line. 
                  (3)  A recreational vehicle shall not be occupied either temporarily or permanently while it is parked or stored in any area except in a recreational vehicle park authorized under this chapter, or as otherwise stated in this chapter. 
                  (4)  In all residentially zoned districts it is prohibited to park or store abandoned, wrecked or junked vehicles, power-driven construction equipment, used lumber or metal, commercial vehicles (except those on a service call), or any other miscellaneous scrap or salvageable material in quantity. For the purposes of this subsection, an abandoned vehicle is a vehicle without current state license. 
                  (5)  No automobile, recreational vehicle, trailer, or other vehicle offered for sale shall be parked in the right-of-way. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-105(6); Ord. of 4-4-2016, § 11) 
                  Sec. 119-372. - Buffer areas. 
                  All required buffer areas and landscape strips are in addition to area, yard, and height requirements for the zoning district as specified in this chapter. 
                  (1)  In the commercial districts, any operation not conducted within a building, such as outdoor recreation, outdoor storage of materials, and outdoor servicing activities, shall be enclosed by a solid wall or solid fence or tight evergreen hedge not less than eight feet in height. Wall and fence material must be of similar material to surrounding buildings and must be compatible with the character of the area. The bottom of the fence must be no higher than four inches from the ground. The top of the fence must not evidence significant elevation changes (i.e., the top of the fence at the highest topographic elevation will determine the height of all portions of the fence, regardless of elevation changes). If constructed from wood, the fence height must be achieved by the installation of one continuous eight-foot, or greater, board. The council shall, based on the character of the area, determine whether the applicant must install the solid wall, solid fence, or tight evergreen hedge. 
                  (2)  In any zoning district not subject to other screening requirements but requiring screening of a specified operation, said screening shall be a solid wall or solid fence or tight evergreen hedge not less than eight feet in height. The tight evergreen hedge shall grow to at least eight feet in height within five years. There shall be a perimeter landscape strip at least 20 feet wide, unless otherwise specified, that conforms to the planting requirements of article IV, division 5, of this chapter. All buffer area requirements are in addition to the area, yard, and height requirements for that zoning district. Prior to any site construction or grading, the zoning administrator must approve a landscaping plan prepared pursuant to article IV, division 5, of this chapter. 
                  (3)  Any grading, improvement or construction adjacent to the buffer must not disturb or encroach on the buffer area. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-105(7); Ord. of 4-4-2016, § 12) 
                  Sec. 119-373. - Accessory buildings. 
                  The location of accessory buildings and uses must meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  All accessory building, structures, and uses of land, including off-street parking, shall be located on the same lot as the principal building to which they are accessory. 
                  (2)  Where an accessory building is attached to the main building, a substantial part of one wall of the accessory building shall be an integral part of the main building or such accessory building shall be attached to the main building in a substantial manner by a roof, and therefore meet requirements applicable to the main building. Construction must be of similar material and must be compatible with the character of the area. 
                  (3)  No accessory building shall be utilized unless the principal structure is also occupied. 
                  (4)  In the R1 and R2 zoning district, a detached accessory structure cannot exceed the height of the principal building nor cover more than ten percent of the lot. In the GN and GC zoning district, a detached accessory structure cannot exceed the height of the principal building nor cover more than 30 percent of the lot. A detached accessory building in all other zoning districts shall not cover more than 30 percent of the lot nor exceed a height that will ensure adequate fire protection. Accessory structures must be of similar material to the principal building and must be compatible with the character of the area. 
                  (5)  No detached accessory building may be located on the front yard of a lot. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall not be used as accessory building in any residential zoning district. 
                  (7)  No storage trailer shall be used as a temporary or accessory structure.

                  Sec. 119-374. - Temporary buildings. 
                  Temporary buildings used in conjunction with construction work only may be permitted in any nonresidential zoning district, provided that no temporary building shall be used for a residential purpose and the building shall be removed immediately upon completion of construction.

                  Sec. 119-375. - Home occupation. 
                  The conduct of business (home occupation) in residential units may be permitted under the provisions of this section. It is the intent of this section to ensure the compatibility of home occupations with other uses permitted in the applicable zoning districts; maintain and preserve the character of residential neighborhoods; and provide peace, quiet, and domestic tranquility within all residential neighborhoods within the zoning district, in order to guarantee to all residents freedom from excessive noise, excessive traffic, nuisance, fire hazard, and other possible effect of commercial uses being conducted in this zoning district. Residential home occupations, where permitted, must meet the following special requirements: 
                  (1)  A home occupation is subordinate to the use of a dwelling unit for residential purposes. No more than ten percent of the floor area of the dwelling unit may be used in connection with a home occupation or for storage purposes in connection with a home occupation. 
                  (2)  No more than one home occupation shall be permitted within a single dwelling unit. 
                  (3)  A home occupation shall be carried on wholly within the principal use. No home occupation, nor any storage of goods, materials, or products connected with a home occupation, shall be allowed in accessory buildings or garages, attached or detached. 
                  (4)  No one other than residents of the dwelling shall be employed in the conduct of a home occupation. 
                  (5)  A home occupation shall produce no noise or obnoxious odors, vibrations, glare, fumes, or electrical interference detectable to normal sensory perception outside the structure. 
                  (6)  A home occupation which will constitute a fire hazard to neighboring residences, will adversely affect neighboring property values, or will constitute a nuisance or otherwise be detrimental to the neighbors because of excessive traffic, excessive noise, odors, or other circumstances is not to be permitted. 
                  (7)  No traffic shall be generated by such home occupations in greater volumes than would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood, and any need for parking generated by the conduct of such home occupation shall be met off-street and other than in a front yard. 
                  (8)  On the premises, retail sales are prohibited except for the retail sales of products or goods produced or fabricated on the premises as a result of the home occupation. 
                  (9)  There shall be no exterior indication of the home occupation or variation from the residential character of the principal use. 
                  (10)  No on-street parking of business related vehicles (either marked or commercially equipped) shall be permitted at any home.

All used motor oil shall be stored in underground tanks. However, storage tanks for the retail sales of propane gas shall be permitted. 
                  (8)  Minimum services and facilities required. In the interest of public health and safety, gas stations shall provide all facilities necessary for refueling vehicles, and shall stock and have available all basic supplies normally used in the routine operation of automobiles. This shall include standard grades of gasoline, motor oil, antifreeze/coolant, transmission fluid, and brake fluid. Facilities shall be readily available and maintained in good working order for washing windshield and windows, and refilling air in tires. Providers may charge for the use of these facilities if desired. Gas stations are not obligated to stock automobile repair parts, supplies, or tools.

                  Combination gas station, fast-food restaurant, and convenience stores shall be regulated on a site-by-site basis under conditional standards that address the following issues. 
                  (1)  Circulation. The council shall require that the site accommodate high levels of traffic while maintaining the smooth circulation of vehicles on site. Driveways and service areas shall be placed in locations that reduce the chance of interrupting on-site vehicle movement. Buildings must be placed in a manner that screens the drive-through land and creates pedestrian pathways and spaces. In order to maintain on-site circulation, each drive-through area is to be separate from pump islands and from routes necessary for entering and exiting the property. 
                  (2)  Driveway entrances. Driveway entrances shall be posted "No Thru Traffic". 
                  (3)  Parking. On-site parking for facilities that combine gas stations with convenience stores and fast food restaurants must equal three spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area. 
                  (4)  Landscaping/buffering. 
                  a.  Where the site is adjacent to residential development or commercially zoned properties, landscaping requirements include the construction of a 30-foot-deep transitional organically landscaped bufferyard and an opaque or nearly opaque screen consisting of a wall, fence, or evergreen vegetation to a height of at least eight feet, in addition to a minimum total landscaping equal to at least 20 percent of the area of the site not covered by buildings. 
                  b.  Speaker boxes shall not be audible on any residential property adjacent to the business. 
                  (5)  Signs. Signs shall comply with this article as applied to the commercial zoning districts with the following limitations: 
                  a.  Only one freestanding sign identifying businesses located on the property is allowed. 
                  b.  One wall sign is allowed per subtenant but the aggregate square footage of all subtenant signs cannot exceed 25 percent of the front wall area.

                  Sec. 119-408. - Development density. 
                  (a)  Only acreage devoted to usable land may be used to determine the development density or number of dwelling units permitted. Usable land is determined by subtracting all land with poorly drained or very poorly drained soils, as defined by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, land with slopes in excess of 25 percent, and land within the 100-year floodplain as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), from the total tract area. If the tract lies in more than one zoning district, lot size shall be computed based on a weighted average minimum lot size, considering the proportion of land. 
                  (b)  For instance, if the parcel contains 100 acres but only 80 acres are determined to be usable land, then in the R1 district where the minimum lot size is 20,000 square feet, the number of dwelling units permitted is 174. In actuality, the number will be less once you provide for roads, easements, and any amenities.

                  This section is established to show the minimum size, width, and maximum height requirements for the land uses within each designated zoning district. Lot size shall be based on factors including the size of the building required for that use, required parking, and groundwater flow. The zoning administrator is authorized to increase minimum lot sizes and otherwise vary zoning district development standards to accommodate the need to use septic tanks and/or wells and health department regulations in this regard. The unavailability of public sewer and/or water shall preclude the ability to develop projects which cannot utilize septic tanks.

                  All street frontages shall include either a curb and gutter or alternative drainage meeting the approval of the zoning administrator. If alternative drainage is utilized, the following is required: 
                  (1)  The drainage channel shall be grass, planting or other material as approved by the zoning administrator to prevent erosion and assist in drainage control. 
                  (2)  The drainage channel shall be considered part of the project improvements and shall be: 
                  a.  Designed by a professional licensed in the State of Georgia to undertake drainage design and engineering prior to the recordation of any subdivision plat or associated metes and bounds deed, or issuance of any building permit; and 
                  b.  All improvements shall be installed to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, use, or occupancy of the project.

                  (a)  For areas that must unavoidably be paved, porous pavement materials limit runoff at the paved source. They eliminate auto oil and other street pollutants by treating them in contact with the soil wherever they are generated. 
                  (b)  All driveways and parking areas shall be surfaced in a porous pavement material. Porous pavement may be used for street pavements, and shall be used on all public and private driveways, parking lots, sidewalks, bike and footpath walkways, and pedestrian plazas and courts, except where it is infeasible due to site-specific constraints such as steep unstable slopes, swelling soils, proximity of structural foundations, or steep slope of pavement subgrade. In new developments and in additions to developments where similar porous pavements have not previously been used, representative portions of porous pavements shall be marked by permanent stencil or sign identifying the porous pavements and special restraint that needs to be taken in using and maintaining them.

                  Sec. 119-458. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this division is to establish standards for the development of parking facilities, access to private and public property, and ensure public health and safety with facilities which safely accommodate vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-105(2)(A)) 
                  Sec. 119-459. - Applicability. 
                  (a)  New development. The off-street parking standards apply to any new development and to any new use established. 
                  (b)  Expansions and alterations. The off-street parking standards apply when an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged. Additional off-street parking space shall be required only to serve the enlarged or expanded areas, not the entire building or use. The council may require increases in parking for nonconforming parking areas when found necessary to ensure adequate off-street parking. 
                  (c)  Change or use. Off-street parking shall be required for any change of use or change of operation that would result in a requirement for more parking than the existing use. Additional parking shall be required only in proportion to the extent of the change, not for the entire building or use. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-105(2)(B)(1)) 
                  Sec. 119-460. - Rules for computing requirements. 
                  The following rules apply when computing off-street parking and loading requirements: 
                  (1)  Multiple uses. Lots containing more than one use shall provide shared parking as specified in section 119-461. 
                  (2)  Fractions. When measurements of the number of required spaces result in fractions, any fraction of one-half or less will be disregarded and any fraction of more than one-half will be rounded upward to the next highest whole number. 
                  (3)  Area measurements. Unless otherwise specifically noted, all square footage-based parking and loading standards are to be computed on the basis of gross floor area. 
                  (4)  Unlisted uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed in an off-street parking schedule, the zoning administrator shall apply the off-street parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or require a parking study in accordance with this division. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-105(2)(D)) 
                  Sec. 119-461. - Shared parking. 
                  Two or more uses shall share parking facilities without providing the minimum number of on-site required spaces for each use, provided the following conditions are met: 
                  (1)  The minimum required number of parking spaces for the combined uses shall be reduced by 20 percent where hours of operation overlap and the uses within the businesses share general customer traffic. 
                  (2)  Off-site spaces shall be within 600 feet walking distance of a building entrance or use. If the pedestrian access is to cross an arterial street, appropriate safety measures must be present to help the pedestrian cross the street. In any event, safe and convenient pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk or path, must exist or be provided from the structure or use to the parking lot. 
                  (3)  The parking facility to be shared must contain at least the minimum required spaces of the largest individual use sharing the lot and shall be developed to the extent of at least being paved and striped according to the standards of this chapter. 
                  (4)  The parking facility to be shared must be owned by the owner of one of the uses or leased for at least a 20-year term or through a permanent easement by the owner of the uses being served. 
                  (5)  No changes shall be made to the shared parking facility which would reduce the parking provided for the uses, unless the owner of one of the uses makes other arrangements to provide parking. No such changes shall be made without approval of the zoning administrator. 
                  (6)  Parking spaces to be shared must not be reserved for a specific person, individual, or use on a 24 hour basis. 
                  (7)  Handicap parking spaces cannot be shared, unless the uses that are to share the spaces are adjacent to the handicap spaces and no inconvenience to the users of such spaces would be created. 
                  (8)  Loading space shall not be shared. 
                  (9)  Any proposed change in the use of a structure that shares a parking facility will require proof that adequate parking is available. 
                  (10)  Off-site and shared parking may be used in combination to develop parking facilities, provided all the requirements of this section are met.

                  Sec. 119-462. - Off-street parking. 
                  Within Porterdale, Georgia, off-street automobile storage or parking space shall be provided on every lot on which any permitted or conditional use is established in accordance with this division. 
                  (1)  General requirements. For the purpose of this division the following general requirements are specified: 
                  a.  The term "off-street parking space" means a space at least nine feet wide and 20 feet in length with a minimum net area of 180 square feet, excluding area for egress and ingress and maneuverability of vehicles. 
                  b.  If an off-street parking space cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, the zoning administrator may permit such space to be provided on other off-street property, provided such space lies within 600 feet of the property line of the principal use. The parking space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner. 
                  c.  The required number of parking spaces for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot, but the required space assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use at the same time. 
                  d.  Area reserved for off-street parking in accordance with the requirements of this division shall not be reduced in area or changed to any other use unless the permitted use which it serves is discontinued or modified, and unless equivalent parking space is provided to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator. 
                  e.  Off-street parking existing at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived in connection with the operation of an existing building or use shall not be reduced to an amount less than hereinafter required for a similar new building or use. 
                  (2)  Parking space requirements for all zoning districts. Off-street automobile storage of parking space shall be provided with vehicular access to a street or alley, and shall be equal in or to at least the minimum requirements for the specific land use set forth. 

                   
                  (3)  Off-street parking for land uses with unique parking requirements. Land uses which have widely varying parking demand characteristics make it impossible to specify a single off-street parking standard. Uses found by the council to have unique parking requirements shall comply with the provisions of this subsection. 
                  a.  A developer proposing to develop or expand a land use with unique parking requirements shall submit a parking study that provides justification for the number of off-street parking spaces proposed. A parking study shall include: 
                  1.  Estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers, or other acceptable estimates as approved by the zoning administrator, and should include other reliable data collected from uses of combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, location, or parameters of the use that may be estimated to parking requirements. 
                  2.  The study shall document the source of data used, and methods used to develop the recommendations. After reviewing the parking study, the zoning administrator shall establish a minimum off-street parking standard for the proposed use. 
                  b.  Appeals of the administrative decision may be made to the council in accordance with section 119-6.

                  (a)  Stacking spaces shall be provided for any use having a drive-through facility or areas having drop-off and pick-up areas. The following general standards shall apply to all stacking spaces and drive-through facilities: 
                  (1)  Stacking spaces and lanes for drive-through stations shall not impede on- and off-site traffic movements, shall not cross or pass through off-street parking areas, and shall not create a potentially unsafe condition where crossed by pedestrian access to a public entrance of a building. 
                  (2)  Drive-through lanes shall be separated from off-street parking areas. Individual lanes shall be striped, marked or otherwise distinctly delineated. 
                  (3)  Approach lanes for drive-through facilities shall have the following minimum widths: 
                  a.  One lane: 12 feet per lane. 
                  b.  Two or more lanes: ten feet per lane. 
                  (4)  All drive-through facilities shall be provided with a bypass lane with a minimum width of ten feet. 
                  (5)  Alleys or driveways in residentially zoned areas adjacent to drive-through facilities shall not be used for circulation of customer traffic. 
                  (6)  Each stacking space shall be a minimum of ten feet by 20 feet. 
                  (b)  The number of stacking spaces shall be provided as follows:

                  All off-street parking shall be laid out, constructed, and maintained according to the following requirements (except for residential lots in the residential zoning districts). Off-street parking includes parking spaces or lots for customers and employees. 
                  (1)  All parking areas shall be hard surfaces with concrete or plant bituminous material and maintained in dustproof condition. 
                  (2)  Lighting facilities shall be arranged so that light is reflected away from adjacent properties and streets. If individual light posts are integrated into or mounted on an exposed concrete base, the exposed concrete base cannot exceed six inches in height. 
                  (3)  The parking area shall be adequately drained. 
                  (4)  No sign shall be placed within the public right-of-way. Signs and planting strips shall not obstruct the visibility of drivers or pedestrians.

                  Sec. 119-465. - Use of required parking spaces. 
                  (a)  Use of parking areas. Required off-street parking areas shall be used solely for the parking of licensed motor vehicles in operating condition. Required spaces may not be used for the storage of vehicles, boats, recreational vehicles, mobile homes, or building materials. 
                  (b)  Use of parking areas for temporary events and sales. 
                  (1)  A portion of a parking lot that allows at least 75 percent of the remaining legal parking spaces to be used for parking in conformance with the standards of this division may be set aside for purposes of a temporary event, such as a tent sale, sidewalk/parking lot sale, or other permitted activity. These events may not exceed seven consecutive days in length and may not occur more than once each calendar quarter. 
                  (2)  The property owner and operator of the licensed business at the location are jointly responsible for ensuring that events blocking parking lots do not result in unsafe traffic or circulation conditions and ensuring that there is adequate fire and emergency vehicle access. The police chief, fire chief or their designee may order the event canceled and removed without hearing or notice if found that the arrangement of the temporary event or sale interferes with safe flow of traffic or emergency vehicle access to a site. 
                  (3)  The property owner, business licensed at the site, and entity responsible for the event are jointly responsible for ensuring there is adequate parking at the event site. The use of public right-of-way for event parking is prohibited. Parking arrangements may be made for use of adjoining or nearby parking areas with a 300 foot radius, but a copy of the agreements shall be in writing and filed with the zoning administrator at least two working days prior to the event. 
                  (c)  Long-term vendors located in parking lots. 
                  (1)  Temporary long-term use of a parking lot for a vendor (for example, but not limited to, Christmas trees and seasonal food sales) that will be located in the parking lot for more than seven consecutive days may be permitted by the zoning administrator provided that a copy of a written agreement for use of the parking area is submitted to the zoning administrator prior to the establishment of the use. 
                  (2)  A site plan showing the location of the facility and an indication of the total number of existing spaces in the parking lot and parking to be removed by the vendor shall be submitted to the zoning administrator. 
                  (3)  In no case shall a long-term vendor be permitted to remove more than five percent of the subject property's parking spaces from general usage.

                  Sec. 119-527. - Landscaping objectives. 
                  Landscaping regulations are intended to provide for two options. If a property owner desires to create a landscaping plan that meets the needs of the individual project, the plan may be prepared pursuant to this section and is classified as a "performance" landscaping plan. 
                  (1)  Landscaping is a community enhancement. Landscaping is intended to enhance the aesthetics of development within the city. Each development has unique characteristics based on location, land use, or physical site features. Project proponents may utilize the performance standards in this section in preparing professional quality landscape plans for review and approval by the zoning administrator in association with overall site development. Proponents not desiring to utilize the flexibility and creative opportunities in this section shall utilize the prescribed standards of this section. 
                  (2)  Landscaping performance objectives. In addition to the purposes of this division, performance landscape plans shall, as determined by the council, meet the following objectives: 
                  a.  Provide a transitional landscape area between the public right-of-way and the parking areas. Landscaping shall be used to provide a screening of vehicles in a parking lot from the ground to approximately 36 to 42 inches in height. 
                  b.  Establish a separation and transition from parking to the building through a gradual increase in elevation of landscaping from the parking area to the building height. Plant materials may be a mixture of heights and shapes but designed to bring an appearance of reducing the height of a structure when viewed from the road or neighboring properties, as determined by the zoning administrator. 
                  (3)  Enhance or develop pedestrian-oriented spaces and creation of usable outdoor spaces. 
                  a.  Ensure that service areas are enclosed and landscaping utilized to transition from the parking area. Landscaping or decorative materials used to screen service areas in a combination of concepts, including, and not limited to, shrubs of similar height to the walls, the design of walls as planters, climbing vines, or other treatment that will break up the appearance of walls. 
                  b.  Provide a balance between the overall appearance of the landscaping as a part of a planned site and the buildings on the site. The city's objective is to ensure that the site has dense landscaping in terms of the land area dedicated to landscaping and in vertical elevation of landscaping. 
                  c.  Any flexibility to be applied by the council shall be based on achieving an attractive site with installations of landscaping that are designed to complement and enhance the site development. 
                  (4)  Submission of performance landscape plans. 
                  a.  Performance landscaping plans shall be of adequate size and detail so that the council can see the land area to be planted and the appearance of plantings at the time of installation, at five years healthy growth, and at ten years healthy growth. 
                  b.  Performance landscaping site plans and elevations shall be drawn in a professional manner with credible representations of drip lines, plant growth diameters, and plant sizes. The council shall not require that plans and elevations be prepared by a licensed professional, but the council may reject plans which do not accurately depict the site landscaping proposal in suitable detail for it to make a decision. 
                  c.  Performance landscaping plans shall be accompanied by a planting schedule that identifies both the common and scientific name of each species. The schedule shall include the size at planting, the size at five years of growth, and ten years of growth if the proposed plants are different than the adopted plant schedule.

                  Sec. 119-528. - Prescriptive landscaping standards. 
                  (a)  Calculating plant units. Development must have the following minimum plant units: 
                  (1)  For development within the residential zones: A minimum of 60 plant units is required for each dwelling unit. 
                  (2)  For development within the commercial and industrial zones: A minimum of ten plant units for each 1,000 square feet, or fraction thereof, of gross land area. 
                  (3)  For development within the office-institutional zone: A minimum of 30 plant units for each 1,000 square feet, or fraction thereof, of gross land area. 
                  (b)  Plant unit values. 

                   
                  (c)  Bonus points. Bonus points may be earned towards the total landscaping requirement by using plants which fall into the following categories. Each plant unit is only subject to one bonus multiplier.

                  Sec. 119-529. - Landscape material standards. 
                  (a)  Plants shall be nursery-grown and adapted to the local climate. 
                  (b)  When more than ten trees are required to meet the standards of this section, a mix of species shall be planted. In order to promote diversity in the urban landscape, the minimum number of species to be planted shall vary according to the overall number of trees required. Street trees within the right-of-way are intended to be of a uniform species and are not subject to the provisions of this subsection. In addition to the diversity of species, the council may require diversity of shapes and sizes as a part of the landscape plan. If a landscape proposal is submitted in which a cohesive element of the landscaping design proposes a uniform species as a part of a unique landscape plan, the zoning administrator may waive the species diversity requirement. 

                   
                  (c)  Groundcover. The ground area within required landscape areas shall have appropriate planted landscape treatment applied and present a finished appearance and reasonably complete coverage upon planting. 
                  (d)  No artificial plants or artificial vegetation shall be used to meet any standards of this section.

                  Sec. 119-530. - Installation, replacement, occupancy. 
                  (a)  Accepted practices required. All landscaping shall be installed according to sound nursery practices in a manner designed to encourage vigorous and healthy growth. All landscape material, living and non-living, shall be in place prior to the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy. Living materials shall be in a healthy condition. 
                  (b)  Protection of existing trees during construction. Any trees identified or approved for preservation by the zoning administrator shall be protected utilizing accepted techniques for protection, including, and not limited to, those shown in Figure 4.1. 
                  (c)  Replacement of dead, diseased, or dying vegetation. The zoning administrator may require that landscaping be replaced in-kind if vegetation becomes dead, diseased, or dying. In the event of blight or species-specific diseases, substitution of plants shall be approved by the zoning administrator. 
                  (d)  Temporary occupancy requirements. A certificate of occupancy may be issued prior to the installation of required landscaping upon execution of an agreement with the city and acceptance by the city of appropriate surety. 
                  (1)  Land development that does not require or is normally utilized without obtaining a certificate of occupancy shall have landscaping installed per this section prior to the initiation of any use or any occupancy of the facility, structure, or grounds. 
                  (2)  An agreement for temporary occupancy shall be used only under extenuating circumstances which prohibit the physical installation of landscaping at the time the certificate of occupancy is issued (drought, flooding, etc.). Financial or similar issues shall not constitute extenuating circumstances for the purposes of this section. 
                  (3)  Financial surety shall be equal to 110 percent of the estimated cost of the plant material, labor, and installation, and other materials. 
                  a.  The amount of the surety shall be calculated from a written cost estimate prepared by an appropriately licensed professional and provided to the council by the developer. If the council finds that the cost estimates are not generally within accepted standards for estimating the costs of landscaping installation, the mayor shall require that surety be based on accepted estimating practices. 
                  b.  Each estimate shall be guaranteed valid at the maturity of the surety instrument. 
                  c.  An irrevocable letter of credit, cash deposit, certificate of deposit endorsed in favor of the city, performance bond issued by a bonding company with an investment grade rating by Moodys or Standard and Poors, or savings account passbook issued in favor of the city shall be acceptable forms of surety. 
                  d.  Automatic irrigation required. All landscaping installations shall be required to incorporate an automatic underground irrigation system. Irrigation system shall be approved by the zoning administrator. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-105(8)(K)) 
                  Sec. 119-531. - Parking lot landscaping. 
                  Parking lot landscaping standards of this section establish minimum landscaping requirements for the perimeter and interior of off-street parking areas. The general purpose of such landscaping is to reduce the visual impact of parking and pavement. Parking lots should be effectively landscaped with trees and shrubs to reduce the visual impact of glare, headlights, and parking lot lights from the public right-of-way and from adjoining properties. In addition, parking lots should be adequately shaded to reduce the amount of reflected heat. 
                  (1)  Perimeter parking lot landscaping. The parking lot perimeter landscaping requirements apply to all off-street parking lots that are not otherwise fully screened from view of adjacent public right-of-way. When a lot is located adjacent to a public right-of-way, alternatives should be considered to reduce the visual impact of the parking lot. Some alternatives are: 
                  a.  Use of landscape perimeter borders. Required landscape borders shall be dedicated solely for open space and landscaping. No structures of paving shall be located within the border area, with the exception of walls, walkways or other features incorporated into the landscaping. 
                  b.  Perimeter landscape border options. Any of the following types of perimeter landscape border, detailed in the below chart, may be used to satisfy parking lot border landscaping requirements of this section. 

                   
                  3 Maximum distance: The greatest depth of the parking lot as measured from the front yard property line and the greatest width of the parking lot as measured from adjacent side yard property lines. 
                  4 Minimum width of border: The minimum width of the border shall be in addition to the required setbacks. A parking perimeter border shall be required between the parking areas and the property line and does not apply between the parking area and interior structures or areas. 
                  5 Minimum number of plant units: The minimum number of plant units to be located within the parking perimeter border shall be in addition to the requirements for the square footage of the lot. The number of units shall be calculated based upon the perimeter of the parking area. 
                  6 Type A parking borders may be used on any parking lot. If the depth of the parking lot measured from the property line is more than 150 feet, Type A parking border shall be required. If the depth is from 100 to 150 feet, a Type A or Type B border shall be required. If the depth is less than 100 feet, Type A, B, C, or D border shall be required. The applicant may select the optional border. Depending on site design, a single site may have more than one landscape parking border type. 
                  7 Landscaping is required on the berm. 
                  8 On property line fronting a public or private road as required by the zoning administrator. Landscaping is required in between the wall and right-of-way. 
                  (2)  Parking lot interior landscaping requirements. The parking lot interior landscaping requirements apply to the interior of all off-street parking lots that contain five or more parking spaces. Interior planting areas are required within all parking lots as specified in the subsection. 
                  a.  At least ten square feet of landscape planting area shall be provided within the interior of all off-street parking area for each parking space contained with the area. For parking areas with more than 20 total parking stalls in a double-loaded aisle, a ten-foot wide landscaped island shall run the length of the aisle. This island shall be required for each such aisle. 
                  b.  Landscaping located on the interior of parking areas shall be dispersed throughout the area. All planting areas shall be protected to prevent damage by vehicles and vehicle overhang. 
                  c.  The size of planting areas used to satisfy parking lot interior landscaping requirements shall be sufficient to protect plant materials and ensure proper growth and maintenance. 
                  (3)  Parking lot landscaping requirements when more than the maximum number of parking space is approved. 
                  a.  When the parking space in excess of the defined maximum in division 4 of this article is approved, the minimum interior lot landscaping requirements shall be increased to 12.5 square feet of landscaping for each parking space. 
                  b.  All aisles shall have landscaped areas at each end of the aisle. 
                  c.  Landscaped medians at least ten feet in width shall be required for aisles that align with street access.

                  (Code 2003, § 39-105(10)(M)) 
                  Sec. 119-606. - Computations. 
                  (a)  Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof, that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets chapter regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
                  (b)  Computation of area of multifaced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more that 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. 
                  (c)  Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of the existing grade prior to construction or the newly established grade after construction, including any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot or parcel, whichever is lower. 
                  (d)  Computation of maximum total permitted sign area for a lot or parcel. The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a lot or parcel shall be computed by applying the formula contained in the table below to the lot frontage, building frontage, or wall area, as appropriate, for the zoning district in which the lot is located. Lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street. 
                  Maximum Total Sign Area per Lot or Parcel by Zoning District The maximum total area of all signs on a lot or parcel except incidental, building marker, and identification signs, and flags, shall not exceed the lesser of the following:

                  b Gross square feet of building = 0—2,500 = 100 square feet maximum total area of signs permitted 
                  Gross square feet of building = 2,501—10,000 = 200 square feet maximum total area of signs permitted 
                  Gross square feet of building = 10,001—50,000 = 300 square feet maximum total area of signs permitted 
                  Gross square feet of building = 50,001—100,000 = 400 square feet maximum total area of signs permitted 
                  Gross square feet of building = over 100,000 = 500 square feet maximum total area of signs permitted.

                  (a)  Generally. 
                  (1)  No sign listed within this section shall be placed, constructed, erected, or modified on a lot or parcel without first obtaining a sign permit from the zoning administrator. The property owner shall maintain in force, at all times, a sign permit for any such sign as required in this section. A sign permit is required before a sign is erected or attached to, suspended from, or supported on a building or structure, and before an existing sign may be enlarged, relocated or materially improved upon to an extent of 60 percent of its total replacement value. 
                  (2)  No sign permit of any kind shall be issued for an existing or proposed sign unless such sign is consistent with the requirements of this division. P: permit required; NP: no permit required.

                  (3)  A sign permit shall be issued by the zoning administrator when the plans, specifications and intended use of the applied sign, or part thereof, conform in all respects to the applicable provisions of this division and the building code as certified by the zoning administrator. The application shall be accompanied by plans or such other information as the zoning administrator may require in the exercise of sound discretion in acting upon the application. Standardized sign plans may be filed with the zoning administrator. 
                  (4)  Each application shall contain an agreement to identify and save the city harmless of all damages, demands or expenses or every character which may in any manner be caused by the sign or sign structure. Each applicant shall present to the city on request certification of liability insurance prior to the issuance of a sign permit. 
                  (5)  Signs constructed, erected or maintained for which a permit is required shall have the sign permit number affixed on the framework of the sign in such a manner that the information contained herein shall be readily accessible and durable. 
                  (6)  All signs using electrical wiring and connections shall require an electrical permit. 
                  (7)  A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been completed within a period of six months after the date of issuance. 
                  (b)  Sign permits. 
                  (1)  Initial sign permit. An initial sign permit shall be automatically issued by the zoning administrator covering the period from the date of the inspection of the completed sign installation, construction, or modification through the last day of the calendar year.

Except as provided herein, sign permits shall be renewable annually upon submission of a renewal application form and the applicable fees. Renewal applications shall contain a representation by the applicant that no change in signage under the permit has been made or shall contain dimensions, drawings, and photos of any changes. 
                  (3)  Lapse of sign permit. A continuing sign permit shall lapse automatically if not renewed or if the business license for the premises lapses, is revoked, or is not renewed. A sign permit shall also lapse if the business activity on the premises is discontinued for a period of 180 days or more and is not renewed within 30 days of a notice from the city to the last permittee, sent to the premises, that the sign permit will lapse if such activity is not renewed. 
                  (4)  Assignment of sign permit. A current and valid sign permit shall be freely assignable to a successor as owner of the property or holder of a business license for the same premises, subject only to filing such application as the zoning administrator may require and paying any applicable fee. The assignment shall be accomplished by filing and shall not require approval.

                  Sec. 119-608. - General permit procedures. 
                  The following procedures shall govern the application for, and issuance of, all sign permits under this division, and the submission and review of common signage plans and master signage plans. 
                  (1)  Applications. All applications for sign permits and for approval of a master or common signage plan shall be submitted to the zoning administrator on an application form furnished by the city. 
                  (2)  Fees. Each application for a sign permit or for approval of a master or common signage plan shall be accompanied by the applicable fees, which shall be established by the council. 
                  (3)  Completeness. Within five days of receiving an application, the zoning administrator shall review it for completeness. If the application is found to be complete, the application shall then be processed. If the application is found to be incomplete, the zoning administrator shall, within such five-day period, send to the applicant a notice of the specific ways in which the application is deficient, with appropriate references to the applicable sections of this division. 
                  (4)  Action on sign permit application. Within seven days of the submission of a complete application for a sign permit, the zoning administrator shall either issue the sign permit, if the proposed sign conforms with this division or with a previously approved master or common signage plan, if applicable, or reject the sign permit if the proposed sign fails to conform with the requirements of this division and the master or common signage plan, if applicable. In case of a rejection, the zoning administrator shall specify in the rejection the section or sections of this division or applicable plan with which the signs is inconsistent. 
                  (5)  Action on plan permit application. The zoning administrator shall take action on an application on the following dates:

                  b.  On the date of final action on any related application for building permit, site plan, or development plan for signs involving new construction. 
                  On or before such applicable date, the zoning administrator shall either: 
                  a.  Approve the application if the signs as shown on the plan and the plan itself conforms in every respect with the requirement of this division; or 
                  b.  Reject the application if the signs as shown on the plan or the plan itself fails in any way to conform with the requirement of this division. In case of a rejection, the zoning administrator shall specify in the rejection the section or sections of this division with which the plan is inconsistent. 
                  (6)  Permits to construct or modify signs. An application for construction, creation, or installation of a new sign or for modification of an existing sign shall be accompanied by detailed drawings to show the dimensions, design, structure, and location of each particular sign, to the extent that such details are not contained on a master signage plan or common signage plan then in effect for the lot or parcel. One application and permit may include multiple signs on the same lot or parcel. 
                  (7)  Inspection. The zoning administrator shall notify the code enforcement officer to cause an inspection of the lot or parcel for which a permit for a new sign or for modification of an existing sign is issued during the sixth months after the issuance of such permit or at an earlier date as the owner may request. If the construction is not substantially complete at the time of inspection, the permit shall lapse and become void. If the construction is complete and in full compliance with this division and the building and electrical codes, the zoning administrator code enforcement officer shall affix to the premises a permanent decal identifying the signs and the applicable permit by number or other reference.

                  Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district development regulations, including, but not limited to, set-back requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this division shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.

                  (1)  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (2)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipments must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the council may review the available lighting alternative and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.

                  All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas, if such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this division shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the council shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17.

If, upon inspection, the Porterdale Zoning Administrator concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance. Upon the owner's failure to do so, the city may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the city shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17.

                  (1)  Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or antenna, in any industrial or heavy commercial zoning district; provided, however, that such tower shall be set back from any existing off-site residence a distance equal to the height of the tower; 
                  (2)  Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other freestanding nonresidential structure) that is 50 feet in height or greater, so long as said additional antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said existing structure; and 
                  (3)  Installing an antenna on any existing tower of any height, so long as the addition of said antenna adds not more than 20 feet to the height of said existing tower and said existing tower is not a preexisting tower; provided, however, that such specific permitted use shall not include the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-105(21)(D)) 
                  Sec. 119-675. - Administrative approvals. 
                  (a)  The zoning administrator may administratively approve the uses listed in this section. 
                  (b)  Each applicant for administrative approval shall apply to the zoning administrator, providing the information set forth in section 119-676(b) and (d).

                  (f)  Specific administratively approved uses. The following uses may be approved by the zoning administrator after conducting an administrative review: 
                  (1)  Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other freestanding nonresidential structure) that is less than 50 feet in height, so long as such addition does not add more than 20 feet to the height of the existing structure. 
                  (2)  Installing an antenna on an existing tower of any height, including a preexisting tower and further including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna, so long as the addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said existing tower. 
                  (3)  Locating any alternative tower structure in a zoning district other than light-industrial that in the judgment of the zoning administrator is in conformity with the goals set forth in section 119-668.

                  (a)  General. The following provision shall govern the issuance of conditional use permits: 
                  (1)  If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under section 119-674 or permitted to be approved administratively pursuant to section 119-675, then a conditional use permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in all zoning districts. 
                  (2)  In granting a conditional use permit, the council may impose conditions based on the extent the council concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. 
                  (3)  Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer. 
                  (b)  Information required. Each applicant requesting a conditional use permit under this division shall submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information deemed by the council to be necessary to assess compliance with this division. 
                  (c)  Factors considered in granting conditional use permits. The council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit, although the council may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the council concludes that the goals of this division are better served thereby. 
                  (1)  Height of the proposed tower; 
                  (2)  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential zoning district boundaries; 
                  (3)  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (4)  Surrounding topography; 
                  (5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
                  (6)  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
                  (7)  Proposed ingress and egress; and 
                  (8)  Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in section 119-670. 
                  (d)  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the council that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
                  (1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant engineering requirements. 
                  (2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant engineering requirements. 
                  (3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant proposed antenna and related equipment. 
                  (4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
                  (5)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
                  (6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  (e)  Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a conditional use permit is required; provided, however, that the council may reduce the standard setbacks and separation requirements if the goals of this division would be better served thereby. 
                  (1)  Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure. 
                  (2)  Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
                  (3)  In zoning districts other than industrial or heavy commercial zoning districts, towers over 90 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter of a mile from any existing tower that is over 90 feet in height. 
                  (f)  Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the council may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate. 
                  (g)  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a conditional use permit is required; provided, however, that the council may waive such requirement if the goals of this division would be better served thereby: 
                  (1)  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. 
                  (2)  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirements may be reduced or waived altogether. 
                  (3)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer.

                  Sec. 119-677. - Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. 
                  Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the council notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said 90 days, the city may, in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17, remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.

                  (h)  Nothing in this division shall limit the city from enforcement of its Code, state or federal law by any other legal remedy available to the city. Nothing in this division shall be construed to limit or supplant the power of any city inspector, or other duly empowered officer under the city's ordinances, rules and regulations and the authority granted under state law, as amended, to take necessary action, consistent with the law, to protect the public from property which constitutes a public nuisance or to abate a nuisance by any other lawful means of proceedings.
