PREFACE

         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Dacula, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1993 Code, as updated by ordinances subsequently adopted by the Mayor and City Council through March 6, 2014. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1993 Code, as updated, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Mr. Jim Jenkins, Senior Code Attorney, and Kayla Mahnken, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Heather Coggins, Finance Director, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

                  This city and the inhabitants thereof are hereby constituted and declared a body politic and corporate under the name and style of Dacula, Georgia, and by that name shall have perpetual succession. 

                  (a)  The boundaries of this city shall be those existing on the effective date of the adoption of this charter with such alterations as may be made from time to time in the manner provided by general State law. The boundaries of this city at all times shall be shown on a map, a written description or any combination thereof, to be retained permanently in the office of city clerk and to be designated, as the case may be: "Official Map (or Description) of the Corporate Limits of the City of Dacula, Georgia." Alteration in these boundaries shall be indicated by appropriate entries upon or additions to such map or description. Such entries or additions shall be made by and under the direction of the city clerk. Photographic, typed, or other copies of such map or description certified by the city clerk shall be admitted as evidence in all courts and shall have the same force and effect as with the original map or description. 
                  (b)  The city council may provide for the redrawing of any such map by ordinance to reflect lawful changes in the corporate boundaries. A redrawn map shall supersede for all purposes the earlier map or maps which it is designated to replace.

                  (b)  The powers of this city shall be construed liberally in favor of the city. The specific motion or failure to mention particular powers shall not be construed as limiting in any way the powers of this city. 
                  All powers, functions, rights, privileges, and immunities of the city, its officers agencies, or employees shall be carried into execution as provided by this charter. If this charter makes no provision, such shall be carried into execution as provided by ordinance or as provided by pertinent laws of the State of Georgia. 


                  The legislative authority of the government of this city, except as otherwise specifically provided in this charter, shall be vested in a city council to be composed of a mayor and four council members. The mayor and council members shall be elected in the manner provided by Article V of this chapter [charter]. 
                  The members of the council shall serve for terms of four years and until their respective successors are elected and qualified.

Any person who fails or refuses to obey a lawful order issued in the exercise of these powers by the council shall be punished as provided by ordinance. 
                  Except as otherwise provided by this charter, the council shall be vested with all the powers of government of this city as provided by Article I [of this charter].

Notice of such special meetings shall be served on all other members personally or by telephone personally, at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting. Such notice to council members shall not be required if the mayor and all council members are present when the special meeting is called. Such notice of any special meeting may be waived by a council member in writing before or after such a meeting, and attendance at the meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice on any business transacted in such council member's presence. Only the business stated in the call may be transacted at the special meeting. 
                  (c)  All meetings of the council shall be public to the extent required by general State law. 
                  The council shall adopt its rules of procedure and order of business consistent with the provisions of this charter [and] shall provide for keeping the minutes of its proceedings, which shall be a public record. 
                  Three council members shall constitute a quorum and shall be authorized to transact business of the council.

                  (a)  Every proposed ordinance shall be introduced in writing and in the form required for final adoption. No ordinance shall contain a subject which is not expressed in its title.

                  (b)  An ordinance may be introduced by either the mayor or any member of the council and be read at a regular or special meeting of the city council. Ordinances shall be considered adopted or rejected by the city council in accordance with the rules which it shall establish. 
                  (Ord. of 12-11-1997, §1) 
                  In addition to other acts required by general State law or by specific provisions of this charter to be done by ordinances, acts of the council which have the force and effect of law shall be done by the ordinance. 
                  Section 2.22. - Emergencies. 
                  To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property, or public peace, the council may convene on call of the mayor or one council member and promptly adopt an emergency ordinance, but such ordinance may not levy taxes; grant, renew, or extend a franchise; regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services; or authorize the borrowing of money except for loans to be repaid within 30 days. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing the emergency in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment, or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify. Every emergency ordinance shall automatically stand repealed 30 days following the date upon which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency still exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances. 
                  (2003 Ga. Laws (Act No. 300), § 2, p. 4395)

                  The council may adopt any standard code of technical regulations by reference thereto in an adopting ordinance. The procedure and requirements governing such adopting ordinance shall be as prescribed for ordinances generally. 
                  Section 2.24. - Codification of Ordinances. 
                  All ordinances passed by the mayor and council having the force and effect of law shall be codified in a compilation known and cited officially as "The Code of the City of Dacula, Georgia [2015]." All ordinances contained therein shall be deemed to have been duly passed by the mayor and council and duly signed, authenticated and recorded by the city clerk.

He shall continue to reside in this city during the period of his service. He shall forfeit his office on the same grounds and under the same procedure as for council members.

                  (b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
                  (c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code.

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the county commissioners that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code, since the same would have been enacted by the council without the incorporation in the Code of any such unconstitutional phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section.

                  (c)  All applicants shall furnish data, fingerprints, financial responsibility and other records as required by the City administrator and to ensure compliance with the provisions of this article.

                  (b)  Where the applicant is a partnership or corporation, the provisions of this section shall apply to all its partners, officers, and majority stockholders. In the case of a corporation, the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and the majority stockholder, if an individual. Where the majority stockholder is not an individual, the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and its agent registered under the provisions of this chapter. In the case of a partnership, the license will be issued to all the partners owning at least 20 percent of the partnership, or if no partner owns 20 percent of the partnership, then the general partner, managing partner or the partner with the greatest ownership will be licensed. 
                  (c)  No person, firm or corporation shall be granted any alcoholic beverage license unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the City administrator or his/her designee that such person, partners in the firm, officers and directors of the corporation have not been convicted or plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere, and has been released from parole or probation, to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexually related crime within a period of ten years immediately prior to the filing of such application. At the time an application is submitted for any alcoholic beverage license, the applicant shall, by a duly sworn affidavit, certify that the applicant, nor any of the other owners of the establishment, has not been convicted or has pleaded guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere and has not been released from parole or probation to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexually related crime within a period of ten years immediately prior to the filing of such application. An applicant's first-time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a City ordinance shall not, by itself, make an applicant ineligible for an alcohol license. Should any applicant, partner, or officer used in the sale or dispensing of any alcoholic beverage, after a license has been granted, be convicted or plead guilty or nolo contendere to a crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexually related crime, the license shall be immediately revoked and cancelled. 
                  (d)  No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be granted to any person convicted under any federal, state or local law of any felony, within ten years prior to the filing of application for such license.

                  (g)  The City administrator may decline to issue a license when any person having any ownership interest in the operation of such place of business or control over such place of business does not meet the same character requirements as herein set forth for the licensee. 
                  (h)  All licensed establishments must have and continuously maintain in the county a registered agent upon whom any process, notice or demand required or permitted by law or under this chapter to be served upon the licensee or owner may be served. This person must be a resident of the county. The licensee shall file the name of such agent, along with the written consent of such agent, with the City administrator or his/her designee and shall be in such form as he may prescribe. 
                  (i)  All applicants for any alcoholic beverage license must be of good character, and all operators, managers, clerks, or other employees shall be of like character. Corporate or firm applicants shall be of good business reputation. 
                  (j)  A license application may be denied to any applicant for any alcoholic beverage license where it appears that the applicant would not have adequate financial participation in the proposed business to direct and manage its affairs, or where it appears that the application is intended to be a mere surrogate for a person or persons who would not otherwise qualify for a license for any reason whatsoever. 
                  (k)  The City administrator, in his discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances which may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application or the proposed location of the business. If, in his judgment, circumstances are such that granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application. 
                  (l)  For purposes of this section, a conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which the defendant was allowed to avail themselves of the Georgia First Offender Act (Ga. Laws 1968, p. 324), as amended. Except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender.

                  (b)  All licenses granted hereunder shall be for the calendar year and the full license fee must be paid for a license application filed prior to July 1 of the license year.

                  (g)  An act or omission of a licensee, owner of more than 20 percent interest in the licensed establishment, or employee of the licensee or licensed establishment willingly or knowingly performed, which constitutes a violation of federal or state law or of any provision of this chapter will subject the licensee to suspension or revocation of its license in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, when the City administrator or his/her designee determines to their own satisfaction that the act or omission did occur, regardless of whether any criminal prosecution or conviction ensues; provided, however, in the case of an employee, the City administrator or his/her designee or their designee must determine that the acts of the employee were known to or under reasonable circumstances should have been known to the licensee, were condoned by the licensee, or where the licensee has not established practices or procedures to prevent the violation from occurring. 
                  (h)  A license may be suspended or revoked by the City administrator or his/her designee whenever it can be shown that a licensee hereunder no longer maintains adequate financial responsibility upon which issuance of the license was conditioned or whenever the licensee has defaulted in any obligation of any kind whatsoever, lawfully owing to the City. 
                  (i)  Wherever this chapter permits the City administrator or his/her designee to suspend any license issued hereunder but does not mandate the period of such suspension, such discretion shall be exercised within the guidelines of this subsection.

                  a.  Consistency of penalties mandated by this chapter and those set by the City administrator or his/her designee. 
                  b.  Likelihood of deterring future wrongdoing.

                  (b)  The City administrator or his/her designee shall provide written notice to the applicant or licensee of his order to deny, suspend or revoke the license. Such written notification shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for such action and shall notify the applicant or licensee of the right to appeal under the provisions of this chapter. Any applicant or licensee who is aggrieved or adversely affected by a final action of the City administrator or his/her designee may have a review thereof by appeal to the mayor and council. Such appeal shall be by written petition, filed in the office of the City administrator or his/her designee within 15 days after the final order or action of the City administrator or his/her designee and, in order to defray administrative costs, must be accompanied by a filing fee that will be in an amount as established by the City council from time to time; the filing fee for appeals relating only to pouring permits for employees shall also be in an amount as established by the City council from time to time.

                  (3)  No permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the City marshal or designee, and upon paying a fee in an amount as established by the City council from time to time, and a search of the criminal record of the person completed. Said application shall include, but shall not be limited to, the name, date of birth, and prior arrest record of the person though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order. 
                  (4)  The City marshal or his designee shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any criminal record of the person fingerprinted or cleared.

If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the City marshal or his designee shall notify the person in writing that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and their right to appeal. 
                  (5)  No person shall be granted a pouring permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the City marshal or his designee that such person has not been convicted or plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexually related crime within a period of five years of the date of conviction and has been released from parole or probation, A person's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a City ordinance shall not, by itself, make a person ineligible for an alcohol pouring permit. 
                  a.  No person shall be granted a pouring permit who has been convicted, plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state, or local law for any felony within five years of the date of conviction and has not been released from parole or probation prior to the filing for application for such permit.

Laws 1968, p. 324), as amended. Except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentence in court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender. 
                  (6)  An alcohol pouring permit shall be issued for a period of one calendar year from the date of the original application. As noted in subsection (11) of this section, the alcohol pouring permit must be in the possession of the employee while the employee is working at the licensed establishment. This permit must be in the possession of the employee while the pouring permit holder is working and available for inspection by members of the City marshal or the City administrator or his/her designee. 
                  (7)  No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed, or covered up any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme while making application to the City marshal for an alcoholic beverage pouring permit under this section.

                  (8)  All permits issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the City marshal or their designee, or the City administrator or his/her designee. 
                  (9)  Replacement permits will be issued within 30 days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fee charged for alcohol pouring permits. After 30 days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted. 
                  (10)  All permits issued hereunder remain the property of the City marshal, and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the City marshal or employee of the City administrator's office. 
                  (11)  No licensee shall allow any employee or manager required to hold a permit to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid City pouring permit. For new employees, a receipt issued by the City marshal may be used for a maximum of 30 days from the date of its issue. Licensees are required by this section to inspect and verify that each employee required to do so has in their possession a valid current alcohol pouring permit. 
                  (12)  It shall be the duty of all persons holding any license to sell alcoholic beverages to file with the City marshal or his designee, the name of the establishment, the license number and a list of all employees, with their home addresses and home telephone numbers twice annually, during the month of June and again during the month of December.

                  (b)  The requirement for approval is that the patio/open area be enclosed by some structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink without the licensee's knowledge. 
                  (c)  The height of such structure shall be a minimum of 3½ feet above ground level. It does not have to be solid nor does it have to restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area.

                  (d)  The only entrance or exit from this type of area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises and through an approved fire exit (not for general public use unless a public safety emergency exists). The fire exit should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists. 
                  (e)  In the event that a licensee desires a patio/open sales area inside an existing structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the City administrator or his/her designee. Interior type patio/open sales areas must also meet the requirements of the county's development and fire codes. 
                  (f)  Nothing contained herein shall prohibit a hotel or motel with a consumption-on-the-premises license from making sales and allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages in ballrooms, meeting rooms, reception rooms, or patio areas of such hotel or motel, provided such functions are catered in connection with a meeting, conference, convention or similar type gathering at such hotel or motel.

Interior plans, floor plans and detailed plans of the building are not required or requested at the time of application. If the applicant is a franchisee, then such applicant shall attach a copy of the franchise agreement or contract with the application. All premises for which an alcoholic beverage license shall be issued shall afford therein adequate sanitary toilet facilities and shall be adequately illuminated so that all hallways, passageways and open areas may be clearly seen by the customers therein. The proposed building shall be a stand-alone structure not attached to any other structure. 
                  (c)  It shall be unlawful to sell or dispense any alcoholic beverages from or at a drive-in, drive-thru, drive-up, or service bay, window or other facility. Further, curb service is expressly prohibited.

                  It is prohibited for any person to bring in his own alcoholic beverage (brown bag) in any establishment either licensed or unlicensed to serve alcoholic beverages.

                  (a)  Preamble and purpose. 
                  (1)  Based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida; which experiences the mayor and council believe are relevant to the problems faced by the City and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, the mayor and council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
                  (2)  Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity and semi-nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment," "adult entertainment," or "erotic entertainment" begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or semi-nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or semi-nudity. 
                  (b)  Prohibited. Any establishment licensed under the provisions of this chapter is prohibited from permitting, or engaging in, the following activities: 
                  (1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or of any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals; 
                  (2)  Live entertainment which provides or features nude or semi-nude or erotic dancing, or the performance of obscene acts or acts which simulate: 
                  a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts which are prohibited by law; 
                  b.  The touching, caressing or fondling of the breast, buttock, anus or genitals; or 
                  c.  The displaying of the pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals; 
                  (3)  The showing of any film, still pictures, electronic reproduction or other visual reproductions depicting any of the acts described in subsection (b)(2) of this section which are obscene under state law; or 
                  (4)  The holding, promotion or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the above-prohibited conduct. 
                  (c)  Mainstream activity excluded. Notwithstanding the prohibitions in subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall, or is intended to, apply to theatrical or motion picture performance houses, museums, or the like where the consumption or service of alcohol is not a primary purpose or mainstream activity of such establishment. 
                  (Code 1993, § 5.64.410; Ord. of 10-3-2002, exh. A (part); Ord. of 8-28-2003; Ord. of 2-4-2010; Ord. of 12-1-2011; Ord. of 12-6-2012; Ord. of 10-3-2013; Ord. of 11-7-2013) 


                  No distilled spirits may be sold by the drink for consumption on the premises where sold except: 
                  (1)  In eating establishments regularly serving prepared food, with a full-service kitchen (a full-service kitchen will consist of a three-compartment pot sink, a stove or grill permanently installed, and a refrigerator, all of which must be approved by the health and fire departments), regularly serving food every hour they are open and deriving at least as much gross receipts annually from the sale of prepared meals or food as it derives from the sale of distilled spirits. 
                  (2)  In indoor recreation establishments. 
                  a.  The term "indoor commercial recreational establishment" is limited to establishments: 
                  1.  That regularly serve prepared food, with a full-service kitchen (a full-service kitchen will consist of a three-compartment pot sink, a stove or grill permanently installed, and a refrigerator, all of which must be approved by the health and fire departments), prepared to serve food every hour they are open and deriving at least 70 percent of its total annual gross sales from the sale of prepared meals or foods and recreation activities; and 
                  2.  Wherein the sale of food and alcoholic beverages is incidental to its primary enterprise and activity on the premises. 
                  b.  The primary activity on the premises of the indoor commercial recreational establishment shall be family-oriented in nature, generally to mean a use which attracts a range of individuals from all age groups. Uses may specifically include, but are not limited to, dinner theaters, bowling centers, and other similar uses. Outdoor commercial recreation is not included, nor shall concession sales of alcoholic beverages be permitted. Bingo parlors, dance halls, night clubs, taverns, billiard parlors, video arcades, skating arenas, adult entertainment and/or sexually related entertainment activities, and similar uses are specifically excluded from this definition of indoor commercial recreational establishments, provided that no indoor commercial recreational establishment shall offer alcoholic beverages for sale during the time it is sponsoring events which primarily attract persons under the lawful drinking age in the state. 
                  (3)  In an indoor publicly owned civic and cultural center capable of serving prepared food, with a full-service kitchen (a full-service kitchen will consist of three-compartment pot sink, a stove or grill permanently installed, and a refrigerator, all of which must be approved by the health and fire departments), prepared to serve good every hour they are open and deriving at least 70 percent of its total annual gross sales from the sale of prepared meals or foods and recreation activities. When eating establishments are located in hotels, motels and high-rise office and apartment buildings, every entrance to the establishment shall be from a public lobby, hallway, mall or other publicly used interior portion of the primary use structure. 
                  (4)  No licensee under this article shall allow on the premises any gambling, lottery, video poker machines, pusher machines, and other similar machines or games that simulate casino, blackjack, poker, slot and other games of skill or chance. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent any games officially sanctioned by the Georgia Lottery Corporation. Further, this provision shall not be interpreted to prevent any vending machines, juke boxes, or video arcade games (ex. Ms. Pacman, Galaga, Donkey Kong). 
                  (5)  No licensee under this article shall allow on the premises any billiard table or pool table unless said licensee meets the limitations and requirements related to the percentage of total annual gross revenues from the sale of products or services other than from the sale of alcoholic beverages as established by the Georgia General Assembly in O.C.G.A. § 43-8-2, as said code section exists now or hereafter may be amended.

                  Each application for a license under this article shall be accompanied by a certified check for the full amount of the license fee, together with a separate check or cash in an amount as established by the City council from time to time to defray investigative and administrative costs. If the applicant is denied a state license, the deposit representing the license fee shall be refunded, but the cost paid for investigation and administrative cost shall be retained. However, any person applying for more than one license shall pay only one fee to defray investigative and administrative expenses, which fee shall be the larger of the investigative and administrative fees authorized under this Code. Any applicant for a license under this article who has in existence at the time of making the new application an existing license under this article shall pay no investigative and administrative costs.

                  In addition to the requirements of this chapter, a license for the retail sale of package distilled spirits upon the terms and conditions provided in this article shall be granted by the City council and evidenced by a written approval executed by the majority of the members of the City council. Upon the compliance with the foregoing provision and at the direction of the City council, the City administrator or his/her designee shall issue a license.

                  (a)  At no time shall the number of licenses issued by the City permitting the retail sale of package distilled spirits within the City limits exceed the number found as a result of dividing the total population of the City, as found in the most recent population estimates published by the United States Bureau of the Census, by the whole number 5,000. 
                  (b)  If the number resulting from the division required by subsection (a) of this section is a number other than a whole number (for example 1.75) then said number will be adjusted downward to the next whole number where it will remain until the population increases to such an extent which would cause said number to equal or exceed the next higher whole number. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of licenses permitted by this section shall never be less than one. 
                  (c)  The language contained in subsections (a) and (b) of this section can be expressed in the mathematical formula, as follows: Y ÷ 5,000 = X. "Y" is the total population (as defined in subsection (a) of this section) of the City. "X" is the total number of licenses that can be issued (this number, if not whole, is adjusted downward in accordance with subsection (b) of this section).

                  For licensees who wish to operate a business which conducts both the retail sale of package distilled spirits and the retail sale of package malt beverages and wine, in the case of conflict, the provisions of this article regulating the retail sale of package distilled spirits shall prevail, and compliance with those provisions, rather than the provisions applicable to the license permitting the retail sale of package malt beverages and wine, is required.

If such licensee shall also have a license to sell malt beverages or wine, it shall likewise be unlawful for any such items to be consumed on the premises or to sell unsealed (broken) malt beverages or wine, unless the license holder has obtained a proper malt beverage/wine tasting permit from the City pursuant to section 4-291.

                  Numerous studies, including those published by the Surgeon General of the United States and recent reports of the Environmental Protection Agency, have shown that secondhand smoke is:

                  (2)  A major contributor to indoor air pollution; and 
                  (3)  Particularly harmful to children, elderly people and allergic individuals. 
                  Accordingly, the mayor and council finds and declares that the purpose of this article is to protect the public health and welfare by regulating smoking in public places and places of employment.

                  (3)  Not be required to make any expenditures or structural changes to create a smoke-free work area. In the event an employer cannot, after using its best efforts, comply with an employee's request for smoke-free work area, the employer shall designate that employee's work area as a smoke-free work area. 
                  (Code 1993, § 8.36.031; Ord. of 8-6-1998, § 1(part))

                  Nothing in this article shall be deemed, interpreted or construed to restrict or prohibit any person in charge of any public place or place of employment from designating that place a smoke-free facility and prohibiting smoking in areas which otherwise would be permitted by this article.

                  (a)  Because ordinances regulating smoking are primarily self-enforcing, adequate signage is important. 
                  (b)  Signs displaying the words "Smoking," "No Smoking," or the international symbol for "No Smoking" consisting of a pictorial representation of a burning cigarette enclosed in a red circle with a red bar across it, whichever is appropriate, shall be conspicuously posted in every public place and place of employment where smoking is regulated by this article by the person in charge of such facility.

                  (b)  The department of health may initiate any action to seek enforcement of this article on its own motion or upon information provided by any citizen. Any officer of the police department or city marshal also may initiate an action for violation of this article if a violation occurs in his presence.

                  (c)  Any owner, operator or manager of any establishment regulated by this article shall inform persons violating this article's provisions. 
                  (d)  In any dispute arising under this article, the need to breathe smoke-free air shall be given precedence over the need to smoke. 
                  (Code 1993, § 8.36.070; Ord. of 8-6-1998, § 1(part))

                  (a)  Equivalency standards. The department shall review absorption field products that differ in design from the conventional on-site sewage management system. The following standards will be used to determine equivalency to the conventional on-site sewage management system: 
                  (1)  The design infiltrative surface is the wetted trench bottom area. 
                  (2)  Due to the combined effects of compaction, contact area and fines associated with gravel aggregate, the effective infiltrative surface area is reduced by an estimated 50 percent. 
                  (3)  The minimum amount of effective trench bottom infiltrative surface area per linear foot shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system. 
                  (4)  Sidewall area shall not be considered for design reduction. The minimum amount of effective sidewall infiltrative surface area per linear foot shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system. 
                  (5)  The minimum storage volume required for a system shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system. 
                  (6)  The design absorption area required is based on the most hydraulically limiting soil horizon that comes into contact with the infiltrative surface of the sidewall, trench bottom and for a distance one foot below the absorption trench bottom. 
                  Infiltration area for conventional 36-inch wide gravel trench absorption 

                   
                  (b)  Prior approval. Lots approved for development based on a reduction in absorption trench length up to 50 percent shall continue to be approved and permitted for up to a 50 percent reduction in absorption trench length provided the lot is part of a recorded plat or part of a preliminary development plan submitted to the county board of health within one year of rule adoption. Preliminary plans must include, as a minimum, proposed lots and streets with lot identifications, lot dimensions and square footage; a topographic map with watercourses and floodplain identified; a level three soil report; the location of the water supply system, rights-of-way, easements and utilities; and the name, registration number and seal of the professional surveyor or engineer.

                  Sec. 10-29. - Statutory authority; findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The state legislature has, in planning and enabling legislation of 1957, as amended, statutes delegating the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. 
                  (b)  Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other properties which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
                  (Code 1993, § 15.08.010; Ord. of 5-7-1985, art. 1, §§ A, B) 
                  Sec. 10-30. - Purpose and objectives. 
                  (a)  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
                  (2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, streams channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
                  (4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
                  (5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazard to other lands. 
                  (b)  The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
                  (5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood-blight areas; and 
                  (7)  Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Sec. 10-31. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
                  Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
                  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and 
                  (2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface water from any source. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency where the areas of special flood hazard have been designated as Zone A. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements. 
                  Mobile home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "mobile home" does not include recreational vehicles or travel trailers. 
                  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For a structure (other than a mobile home) without a basement or poured footings, the "actual start" includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling or foundation. For a mobile home not within a mobile home park or mobile home subdivision, the "actual start" means the affixing of the mobile home to its permanent site. For mobile homes within mobile home parks or mobile home subdivisions, the "actual start" is the date on which the construction of facilities for servicing the site on which the mobile home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the construction of streets, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads, and installation of utilities) is completed. 
                  Start of construction means (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Public Law 97-348)), substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (other than a mobile home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the state of excavation. 
                  Substantial improvements means, for a structure built prior to the enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived, any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvements or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration on any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure; to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or to an alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.

                  Sec. 10-36. - Article provisions not inclusive. 
                  In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
                  (Code 1993, § 15.08.080; Ord. of 5-7-1985, art. 3, § E) 
                  Sec. 10-37. - Flood damages; City not liable. 
                  The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the City or by any officer or employee thereon for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

                  Sec. 10-38. - Development permit—Application. 
                  (a)  A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article. 
                  (b)  Application for a development permit shall be made to the City on forms furnished by the City and may include but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill storage of materials; drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
                  (1)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed structures; 
                  (2)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure will be floodproofed; 
                  (3)  Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure meets the floodproofing criteria in section 10-45(a); 
                  (4)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.

                  Sec. 10-39. - Same—City administrator authority. 
                  (a)  Duties of City administrator. The City administrator is hereby appointed to administer and implement this article by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its provisions. Duties of the City clerk shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
                  (1)  Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this article have been satisfied; 
                  (2)  Advise the permittee that additional federal or state permits may be required and, if specific federal or state permits are known, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the development permit; 
                  (3)  Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development merit adversely affects the flood-carrying capacity of the floodplain. For purpose of this article, the term "adversely affects" means damage to adjacent properties because of rises in flood stages attributed to physical changes of the channel and the adjacent overbank areas. 
                  a.  If it is determined that there is no adverse effect, and the development is not a building, then the permit shall be granted without further consideration. 
                  b.  If it is determined that there is an adverse effect, then technical justification (i.e., a professional engineering analysis) for the purpose development shall be required. 
                  c.  If the proposed development is a building, then the provisions of this article shall apply. 
                  (b)  Use of other base flood data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the City clerk shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer section 10-45. 
                  (c)  Information to be obtained and maintained.

                  Sec. 10-69. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 10-69(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in EPD Rule 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 10-70. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City without first obtaining a permit from the City to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 10-69(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) or shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 10-69(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 10-70(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 10-69(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permit requirements. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 10-69(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 10-70(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 10-71. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The City administrator, City planner, or City building inspector will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The City administrator, City planner, or City building inspector shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 10-72. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop work order. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 10-70(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any City charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Sec. 10-97. - General requirements. 
                  The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennae, governed by this article. 
                  (1)  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of communication towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the telecommunications industry association, as amended from time to time. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communication towers at least once every three years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in the state. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the director. 
                  (2)  Regulatory compliance. 
                  a.  All towers and antennae must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennae. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the communications towers and antennae governed by this article shall bring such communications towers and antennae into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. 
                  b.  Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communication tower is in compliance with all federal requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  (3)  Security. Communication towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, the director or the City council may waive such requirements for alternative tower structures. 
                  (4)  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  (5)  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower. 
                  (6)  Visual impact. 
                  a.  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  c.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  d.  Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design. 
                  e.  Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower. 
                  (7)  Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows: 
                  a.  For towers 150 feet tall or less, a buffer area no less than six feet wide shall commence at the property line. 
                  b.  For towers more than 150 feet tall, a buffer area not less than ten feet wide shall be provided at the property line. 
                  c.  The buffer zone is to consist of materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in height within two years of planting. 
                  d.  Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 20 feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff/maintenance. 
                  e.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  f.  In lieu of these standards, the director may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions in this subsection, except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or develop heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the director. 
                  (8)  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector and a local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street. 
                  (9)  Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
                  a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made. 
                  b.  Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, setback, separation and general requirements of this article are met, towers may occupy a parcel meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. The minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be for a monopole or lattice tower the greater of 20 percent of the tower height or 25 feet and for a guy tower the greater of 100 percent breakpoint or 25 feet. This separation is required to ensure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site. 
                  c.  Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials, such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals. 
                  (10)  Tower lot size, setbacks and separations. 
                  a.  The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to: 
                  1.  Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as required in subsections (6) and (7) of this section; 
                  2.  Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property; 
                  3.  Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 10-99. 
                  b.  A site is presumed to be of sufficient size when it: 
                  1.  Meets the requirements of the subsection (10)a of this section; 
                  2.  Provides a setback equal to two times the height of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street; and 
                  3.  Provides a setback equal to or exceeding the rear yard setback required for the adjoining property where the adjoining property is not in a residential district nor a public property or a public street. 
                  c.  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
                  d.  For a guyed structure, the site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide a setback equal to at least the height of the tower from a guy anchor to any property line abutting a residential district, public property or public street in addition to the size required to comply with subsection (10)b of this section. Such setback shall be adequate to provide a vegetative, topographic or other buffer sufficient to obscure view to the anchor from such adjoining properties. 
                  e.  All structures and uses associated with the transmission use other than the transmission tower shall be located to meet the setbacks required in the zoning district where the tower is to be located. To encourage and accommodate shared use of a tower, the director may waive or reduce setback requirements by up to 50 percent to accommodate the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment at a tower site. 
                  f.  No freestanding communication tower shall be allowed within a 1,000-foot radius of an existing tower within a residential area. 
                  g.  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard of a residential district. 
                  h.  All freestanding towers constructed after October 1, 1996, shall conform to the following minimum tower separation requirements: 

                   
                  Towers and antennae mounted on rooftops or alternative tower structures shall be exempt from these minimum separation distances.

                  All new towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum number of additional uses technically practicable. 
                  (1)  To encourage shared use of towers, no building permit or special use permit shall be required for the addition of antennae to an existing tower so long as the height of the tower or structure on which the antenna is placed is not increased and the requirements of sections 10-96(b) and 10-97 are met. 
                  (2)  If a new tower is approved, the owner shall be required as conditions of approval, to: 
                  a.  Record the letter of intent required by section 10-100(10) in miscellaneous deed records of the office of the county clerk of the superior court where the tower site is located; 
                  b.  Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information from a potential shared use applicant; 
                  c.  Negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties; and 
                  d.  Allow shared use where the third party seeking such use agrees in writing to pay reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all charges necessary to modify the tower and transmitters to accommodate shared use, but not total tower reconstruction, and to observe whatever technical requirements are necessary to allow shared use without creating interference. 
                  (3)  Willful, knowing failure of an owner whose tower was approved after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, to comply with the requirements of subsection (2) of this section shall be grounds for withholding approval of any application by such owner for a building permit or special use permit for any tower or antenna. 
                  (4)  Such conditions shall run with the land and be binding on subsequent purchasers of the tower site.

                  Sec. 10-99. - Special use permits. 
                  (a)  A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the City and handled in accordance with the special use permit provision of section 1408 of the zoning resolution of the City. The City council may issue a special use permit under this section provided it shall have determined that all of the general requirements of section 10-97 have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties. 
                  (b)  In granting a special use permit, the City council may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding property.

                  (7)  A description of anticipated maintenance needs, including frequency of service, personnel needs, equipment needs, and traffic, noise or safety impacts of such maintenance; 
                  (8)  Report from a professional structural engineer licensed in the state, documenting the following: 
                  a.  Tower height and design, including technical, engineering, economic and other pertinent factors governing selection of the proposed design. A cross section of the tower structure shall be included; 
                  b.  Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including number and types of antennae which can be accommodated; 
                  c.  Evidence of structural integrity of the tower structure; 
                  d.  Failure characteristics of the tower and demonstration that site and setbacks are of adequate size to contain debris; 
                  (9)  Written statements from the FAA, FCC and any appropriate state review authority stating that the proposed tower complies with regulations administered by that agency or that the tower is exempt from those regulations; 
                  (10)  Letter of intent to lease excess space on the tower structure and to lease additional excess land on the tower site when the share use potential of the tower is absorbed, if structurally and technically possible; 
                  (11)  A reasonable pro rata charge may be made for shared use, consistent with an appropriate sharing of construction, financing and maintenance costs. Fees may also be charged for any structural or RF changes necessitated by such shared use. Such sharing shall be condition of approval if approval is granted. 
                  a.  The applicant shall describe what range of charges is reasonably expected to be assessed against shared users. 
                  b.  The applicant shall base charges on generally accepted accounting principles and shall explain the elements included in the charge; 
                  (12)  The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number and types of antennae. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitation and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The director shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means; 
                  (13)  Evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna; 
                  (14)  Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or planned towers can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna/transmitter as described in this subsection. 
                  a.  The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the applicant. A list shall be provided of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, and the form and content of such contact. 
                  b.  Such contact shall be made in a timely manner; that is, sufficiently before the filing of an application for a building or special use permit to include a response into the application when filed. 
                  1.  Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, where an existing or planned tower is known to have capacity for additional antennae of the sort proposed, based on the decision regarding such tower, that application for a new tower shall not be complete until the owner of the existing or planned tower responds. Such response is to be required as a condition of approval. 
                  2.  The director shall maintain and provide, on request, records of responses from each owner. 
                  3.  Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower as described in this section, the owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennae of the sort proposed. 
                  c.  The applicant shall request the following information from each owner contacted: 
                  1.  Identification of the site by location, tax lot number, existing uses and tower height; 
                  2.  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring structural changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length, weight and other relevant data about the proposed antenna; 
                  3.  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be required; 
                  4.  If structurally able, would shared use by such existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the proposed tower, if at all; 
                  5.  If shared use is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower would charge for such shared use. 
                  d.  Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. The director and the governing body may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee and costs and reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable; 
                  (15)  Any other information which may be requested by the director to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed tower and/or antenna.

                  (a)  Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of the tower. The owner of an abandoned antenna or tower and the owner of the property where the tower is located shall be under a duty to remove such a tower or antenna. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the City notifying the owner of such abandonment, the City may seek to have such tower or antenna declared a structural public nuisance as provided for in chapter 13, article IV and removed accordingly. The City may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned communication towers and antenna are removed. Delay by the City in taking action shall not in any way waive the City's right to take action. The City may seek to have the communication tower or antenna removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  (b)  If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this article as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna.

                  ARTICLE V. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION 

                  Sec. 10-124. - Description. 
                  (a)  An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to a municipal or county separate storm sewer system (stormwater drainage system) that is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff (except for discharges allowed under an NPDES permit or non-polluting flows). These non-stormwater discharges occur due to illegal dumping or illegal connections to the stormwater drainage system. This article provides the City with the authority to deal with illicit discharges and establishes enforcement actions for those persons or entities found to be in noncompliance or that refuse to allow access to their facilities. 
                  (b)  Introduction. It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Discharges to the City separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (2)  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the City separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments; 
                  (3)  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters; 
                  (4)  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (5)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the City separate storm sewer system; 
                  (6)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the City separate storm sewer system. 
                  Therefore, the City adopts the ordinance from which this article is derived to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the City separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the City separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

                  (2)  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the City separate storm sewer system; 
                  (3)  Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the City separate storm sewer system; and 
                  (4)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
                  (b)  Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the City limits. 
                  (c)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (d)  Responsibility for administration. The City administrator or his/her designee shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article.

                  ARTICLE VI. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 

                  Sec. 10-161. - Description. 
                  This article addresses post-development stormwater management requirements for new development and redevelopment in a community. The article defines requirements for a post-development stormwater management plan, which is required in order to undertake land development activities. This plan contains the details of how the development will address post-development stormwater runoff quality and quantity impacts resulting from the permanent alteration of the character and hydrology of the land surface as well as the nonpoint source pollution from land use activities. The article also outlines the water quantity and quality performance criteria for managing this runoff and specifies local requirements for the use of structural stormwater controls and nonstructural practices, in order to protect public health and safety, protection of public and private property and infrastructure, and environmental protection. Ongoing long-term inspection and maintenance provisions are provided. The majority of technical criteria and standards are adopted by reference through the use of a local stormwater management design manual. 
                  (Ord. of 9-4-2008, desc. ¶) 
                  Sec. 10-162. - Introduction. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  (2)  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (3)  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (4)  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  (5)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution. 
                  Therefore, the City has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  (Ord. of 9-4-2008, intro. ¶) 
                  Sec. 10-163. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
                  (b)  Applicability. 
                  (1)  This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to this subsection (b). These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
                  a.  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
                  b.  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
                  c.  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the City administrator or his/her designee to be a hotspot land use; or 
                  d.  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in subsections (b)(1)a and b of this section if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  (2)  The following activities are exempt from this article: 
                  a.  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
                  b.  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
                  c.  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
                  d.  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the City administrator or his/her designee. 
                  (c)  Designation of article administrator. The City administrator or his/her designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
                  (d)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (e)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
                  (f)  Stormwater design manual. The City will utilize the policy, criteria and information including technical specifications and standards in the latest edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and any relevant local addenda, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article. The manual may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring and local maintenance experience.

                  ARTICLE VII. - ARCHITECTURAL AND DESIGN STANDARDS 

                  Sec. 10-192. - Objectives and findings. 
                  (a)  In an effort to maintain high quality, long-lasting and sustainable development within the City, the City hereby adopts the following design guidelines and standards for all newly constructed buildings within R-TH, RSR, O-I, C-1, C-2, C-3, M-1 and M-2 zoning districts. These guidelines are intended to enhance the visual aspect and livability of the City. These guidelines will foster architectural diversity and interest, yet achieve and maintain a consistent, durable and pleasing aesthetic/visual quality. 
                  (b)  Each building should be created as an enduring feature of the City's built and natural environment contributing to the productivity of our economy, social/civic network and ecological condition. The use of quality local materials is encouraged in order to minimize the operational and environmental cost over the life of each building. A typical building exterior shall require little maintenance and achieve a life span of at least 80 years. 
                  (c)  The use of building materials should create a consistent and traditional architectural identity for each building/development. Traditional architecture may include the use of brick, pitched roofs, low-profile signage and subdued colors. For large commercial/retail buildings, variations in facade, roofline and depth shall be provided to lend the appearance of multi-tenant occupancy and reduce the perceived scale of such a building. 
                  (Ord. of 8-6-2009, § 1) 
                  Sec. 10-193. - Grandfathering and adoption. 
                  (a)  The following design guidelines and standards apply to all newly constructed nonresidential or multifamily buildings within R-TH, RSR, O-I, C-1, C-2, C-3, M-1 and M-2 zoning districts. Properties with zoning conditions that do not address architectural and design standards of new construction of nonresidential or multifamily buildings are subject to this article in full. 
                  (b)  Properties with existing zoning conditions pertaining to architectural or design criteria are exempt from further requirements of this article. Any project within the City that has received or applied for a building permit by the date of adoption of these requirements shall be allowed to proceed under the previous requirements. In addition to applicable provisions outlined in Article VIII of the 2000 Zoning Resolution of the City relating to nonconforming uses, any building addition or enlargement to a lawfully constructed building shall not be subject to these requirements. 
                  (Ord. of 8-6-2009, § 2) 
                  Sec. 10-194. - Building plans. 
                  (a)  All building plans submitted as an application for a building permit should clearly indicate all of the proposed building materials and colors for each facade as described herein. The plans should clearly show the location, dimensions and calculate the amount/percentages of all building materials per facade. 
                  (b)  The following design standards are primarily based upon the City's zoning categories. However if a use is permitted in a more intensive zoning district, building material allocations shall be used for the less intensive classification (e.g., a professional office in a M-1 or M-2 zoning district shall use the building material allocations in Table I for O-I categories. Said table can be found in section 10-197).

                  Sec. 10-197. - Building materials. 
                  The following building materials may be used and combined to create a consistent, attractive, interesting, and long-lasting building design within the general architectural requirements. The quantity and type of building materials are outlined in this section. 
                  (1)  Allowed building materials. 
                  a.  Brick. Painted brick and simulated brick veneers which are intended to imitate masonry exteriors are not permitted; 
                  b.  Stone. Natural stone, such as, but not limited to, granite, limestone, and marble, is allowed building materials. Terra cotta, cast stone, cultured stone are also acceptable. Painted stone or mass produced sheets of simulated stone which are intended to imitate masonry exteriors are not permitted; 
                  c.  Glass. Reflective or glass tinted more than 20 percent is not permitted; 
                  d.  High grade siding. High grade fiber cement siding; 
                  e.  Stucco. High grade stucco/E.I.F.S (exterior insulation and finish systems); 
                  f.  Block. Split face block; 
                  g.  Siding. Fiber cement siding. 
                  (2)  Ratios and amounts of allowed building materials. The following tables outline the allowed building materials for uses within each zoning category within the City: 
                  Table 1. Allowed Building Materials - Buildings Under 25,000 Square Feet Gross Floor Area (GFA) 

                   
                  Table II. Allowed Building Materials - Buildings With 25,000 - 150,000 Square Feet GFA 

                   
                  Table III. Allowed Building Materials - Buildings or Common Developments With More Than 150,000 Square Feet GFA 

                   
                  NOTES: 
                  # Allowed only on rear facades of single buildings or common developments larger than 150,000 square feet gross floor area and must be finished to match building's primary color. Rear building wall must be screened from adjacent right-of-way, residential uses, retail uses or service uses by an opaque landscape buffer to consist of multiple staggered rows of evergreen and semi-evergreen trees and shrubs native or adapted to the area. Trees shall be six feet tall at time of planting. Plantings shall be arranged to provide an effective visual screen of at least the height of the wall at maturity. Buffer must be shown on a landscape plan to be approved by planning and development prior to receiving any permits. 
                  * Exterior walls must be constructed and finished in accordance with all other provisions of the architectural and design standards. Acceptable finish treatments shall include any of the allowed building materials from Table III adapted for use in a tilt/pre-cast wall application. 
                  (3)  Accent/trim exterior building material. Small amounts of building materials, such as wood, tile, etc., may be used to enhance the elevation of the building or for decorative elements but should not exceed ten percent of total wall area per facade. 
                  (4)  Facade calculations. With the exception of accent/trim materials, there shall be no more than two primary building materials used. When a material is restricted as a percentage in Table I or Table II in subsection (2) of this section, such as stucco or siding, the building material may not be considered a primary building material or be combined with another restricted building material. The allowed facade materials shall not apply to windows, glass-front windows, entry doors and/or roll-up doors. The amount of permitted material shall be calculated using the gross square footage of wall area per facade. A building material that is allowed (such as brick) may be used in any percentage throughout the structure. A material that is restricted (such as stucco and split face block) is allowed as a maximum percentage. For example, a building has a front facade with a gross facade area of 1,200 square feet with 400 square feet consisting of windows and doors. Begin with 1,200 square feet for required building material calculations. In this case, the front facade of a building in C-2 zoning district with a wall area of 1,200 square feet shall have no more than 300 square feet of stucco on the front facade (ex. (1,200 X 25% = 300)). The balance shall be brick or other allowed material. 
                  a.  For buildings with less than 15,000 square feet GFA, multi-pane windows shall be used in individual window openings, rather than large glass sheets. 
                  b.  Mirrored glass with a reflection greater than 20 percent and glass curtain walls shall be prohibited. 
                  c.  For buildings with less than 15,000 square feet GFA, window areas shall not extend down to the floor line. A wall of not less than two feet in height shall separate the floor from the bottom of the window frame. 
                  d.  Building facades shall be visually divided into segments through articulation of the facade achieved by methods such as, but not limited to, variation in building materials, roofline, building setback, the use of additional window bays, pilasters. The segments shall be determined based on the length of the facade as shown:

                  Sec. 10-198. - Roof requirements. 
                  (a)  Pitched roofs. All one-story buildings less than 10,000 gross square feet must have a pitched roof (between 3:12 and 12:12). If a pitched roof is not possible, a combination of flat roof and pitched roof shall be required. Provide a pitched roof on front and side of the building to screen view of any flat roof. Cover arcades, canopies, porches, balconies and other similar features with a pitched roof. Materials for pitched roofs shall be limited to architectural dimensional grade asphalt shingles, natural slate, natural terra cotta, natural wood shake, or factory finished enamel metal roofing. 
                  (b)  Mansard roofs. Mansard roofs shall have a maximum pitch of 12:12 with a minimum 12 foot vertical surface length. 
                  (c)  Flat roofs. Flat roofs may be of any material that meets local codes. If factory finished metal flashing is used the color must be subdued to blend with other materials used in the construction of the roof. All buildings with flat roofs shall include parapet articulation on the front facade of such building. There shall be roof articulations/offsets at a minimum of one foot per each 120 linear feet of length by a change in the top line of the parapet. Additional articulation may occur at any lesser distance. If the front facade is less than 120 linear feet, then a minimum of one roof articulation must occur. 
                  (d)  Other. Drive under canopies for gasoline pumps may have flat roof with vertical or factory formed facing of finished sheet metal.

                  Sec. 10-200. - Alternate review. 
                  (a)  This article is intended to be followed as outlined in this section. In the event the intent of this article can be achieved with minor deviations which do not substantially impact the goals or intent of this article, the director of the City department of planning and development has the authority to modify the specific provisions. If substantial modifications or changes are necessary, any person, firm, group or organization may apply for relief from these requirements to the City council in accordance with Article VII, Section 706 of the City of Dacula Zoning Ordinance. 
                  (b)  Any application for an alternate architectural arrangement shall be accompanied with proposed elevations, building materials, and/or renderings necessary for the City council to make a determination whether the alternate proposal meets the intent of these requirements. The City council, as part of an approval, may include conditions, modifications or requirements necessary to mitigate any part of their decision. The City may establish filing requirements, fees and deadlines as needed.

                  (b)  Statement of purpose . It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by: 
                  (1)  Restricting or prohibiting development or construction activities which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to flooding or erosion hazards or in flood heights or velocities; 
                  (2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or renovation; 
                  (3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
                  (4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
                  (5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
                  (c)  Special definitions . The following definitions of words or phrases apply only to their use and application within the context of this article, and are included herein because of their special nature. 
                  Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year; i.e., the "100-year flood." 
                  Base flood elevation means the highest water surface elevation anticipated at any given point during the base flood. 
                  Compensation means the replacement of flood storage capacity lost as the result of floodplain encroachment. 
                  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) means the federal agency which administers the National Flood Insurance Program. This agency prepares, revises and distributes the maps and studies referenced in this article. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas. 
                  Flood boundary and floodway map means the official map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the floodways are shown and the areas of special flood hazard have been defined as Zone "A." 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the applicable risk premium zones. 
                  Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the flood boundary and floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means those lands subject to flooding, which would have at least a one percent probability of flooding occurrence in any calendar year based on the basin being fully developed as shown on the current land use plan; i.e., the regulatory flood. This area has an inundation of normally dry land outside the limits of the stream channel or stream banks. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
                  Regulatory flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year assuming the drainage basin is fully developed as shown on the current land use plan. 
                  Regulatory flood elevation means the highest water surface elevation anticipated at any given point during the regulatory flood. 
                  Watercourse means a channel with a defined bed and banks, including lakes, ponds, and marshes.

                  Sec. 10-227. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Flood area maps and studies . For the purposes of this article, the following are adopted: 
                  (1)  The floodway boundary and floodway maps as well as the flood insurance rate maps, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its various flood insurance studies for unincorporated areas of the county and the incorporated City, as most recently amended by FEMA, with accompanying maps and other supporting data. 
                  (2)  Other studies which may be relied upon for establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the 100-year floodplain include: 
                  a.  Any flood or flood related study conducted by the United States Corps of Engineers or the United States Geological Survey applicable to the county and/or the City. 
                  b.  Any base flood study authored by a registered professional engineer in the state which has been approved by the City. 
                  (3)  Other studies which may be relied upon for establishment of the regulatory flood elevation or delineation of the regulatory floodplain include: 
                  a.  Any flood or flood related study conducted by the United States Corps of Engineers or the United States Geological Survey applicable to the county and/or the City. 
                  b.  Any regulatory flood study authored by a registered professional engineer in the state which has been approved by the City. 
                  (b)  Areas regulated . Floodplain and floodprone areas as defined herein at or below the base flood elevation or the regulatory flood elevation are regulated by this article (including A, AO, AH, AE, A1-30, or A-99) on the FIRM. 
                  (c)  Interpretation . 
                  (1)  In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be: 
                  a.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
                  b.  Liberally construed in favor of the City; and 
                  c.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
                  (2)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of floodplain or floodway boundaries (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), the City shall make the necessary interpretation based on data submitted by the applicant. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this article. 
                  (3)  Where floodplain elevations have been defined, the floodplain shall be determined based on flood elevations rather than the area graphically delineated on the floodplain maps. 
                  (d)  Permitted uses. Uses of land and water in the regulatory floodplain shall be governed by the zoning resolution. 
                  (e)  Drainage easement established. On behalf of the public, a drainage easement is hereby established for the sole purpose of preserving and protecting the free flow of surface waters inside the regulatory flood contour elevations and along all watercourses. Where debris has accumulated in such a manner as would increase the need for flood protection, raise the flood level, or increase the risk of hazardous inundation of adjacent communities or jurisdictions, the City or county is hereby authorized to enter upon such watercourse and clear or remove such debris or obstructions as are hazardous to the public safety. The cost thereof shall be charged to the owner of the property where such debris and/or obstruction were generated. Where erosion has occurred in such a manner as would endanger a building or a structure, the City or county is hereby authorized to enter upon such watercourse and stabilize the channel for public safety. The cost thereof shall be charged to the owner of the property where the erosion has occurred and/or caused the erosion. 
                  (f)  Establishment of land disturbance permit. A land disturbance permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of these development regulations prior to the commencement of any clearing, grading, or development activities adjacent to, within, or affecting a regulatory floodplain. 
                  (g)  Compliance. No structure or use of land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article, and other applicable regulations. 
                  (h)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and other codes or regulations conflict or overlap, with respect to the prevention of flood damage on property, this article shall prevail. 
                  (i)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard or floodprone areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the City or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article, or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
                  (Ord. of 8-2-2012, § 2) 
                  Sec. 10-228. - Administration. 
                  (a)  General permit procedures. Application for a land disturbance permit on any property where a regulatory floodplain area is located or is proposed to be altered or disturbed in any way shall be made to the City on appropriate forms prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. 
                  (b)  Floodway encroachments. 
                  (1)  Application procedure. An application for a land disturbance permit which proposes any encroachment into or alteration of a floodway shall require submittal to the City complete plans and engineering calculations as required by this article, and FEMA's requirements for "no rise" certification. The City shall review and authorize such encroachments prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit and shall obtain from the applicant an engineering "no-rise" certification signed by a professional engineer stating that the proposed development will not create any change to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths. If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries or base flood elevations, no permit authorizing an encroachment into or the alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City until FEMA has issued an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR). An application for a map revision shall be submitted first to the City. As-built plans and calculations shall be required to be provided to the City by the applicant at the time of completion of the encroachment. Payment of any review fees charged by FEMA shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Final plats or certificates of occupancy shall not be issued by the City until FEMA has issued an affirmative letter of map revision (LOMR). 
                  (2)  Flood levels resulting from floodway encroachments. 
                  a.  Encroachments into a floodway established on the flood boundary and floodway maps or FIRM, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments, shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the regulatory or the base flood (100 year) discharge unless approved by the City and FEMA as outlined in subsection (1) of this section. 
                  b.  In areas where the floodplain has been established but the floodway has not been established on the flood boundary and floodway maps or FIRM, no encroachments into areas of special flood hazard, including fill or structures, shall be authorized unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided to the City demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the regulatory or the base flood more than one foot at any point. The study shall be submitted to FEMA for approval. Approval by FEMA must be received before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. 
                  c.  In areas beyond the limits of study on the flood boundary and floodways maps or FIRM, which contains a watercourse, and have greater than 100 acres of surface drainage area above the property, no increase in flood elevations off-site shall be authorized unless contained in a drainage easement. Increases in flood elevations shall be in accordance with sound engineering and stormwater management practices. 
                  (c)  Other permits or approvals. 
                  (1)  Copies of any additional federal or state permits or approvals as may be required by the Corps of Engineers, Georgia Department of Natural Resources, FEMA, or others shall be provided by the developer upon their approval and maintained on file in the City. 
                  (2)  The City shall notify adjacent communities and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
                  (Ord. of 8-2-2012, § 3) 
                  Sec. 10-229. - Standards for land development. 
                  (a)  Definition of floodplain boundaries. 
                  (1)  FEMA studied "A" zones shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
                  (2)  For floodprone areas, the regulatory flood elevations shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a step-backwater analysis, subject to the approval of the City. 
                  (3)  The boundaries or limits of the floodplain shall be within one-half foot vertical accuracy on the development plan containing existing topographic information. 
                  (b)  Definition of floodway boundaries. 
                  (1)  The width of a floodway shall be determined from a FEMA study. 
                  (2)  Following a pre-design conference with the City, the boundaries or limits of the floodway shall be shown on the development plan containing existing topographic information. 
                  (c)  General standards. 
                  (1)  No construction or structures, including grading, filling, cutting or displacement of earth shall be allowed within the regulatory floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
                  a.  Raise the regulatory flood elevation beyond the boundaries of the ownership of the property being developed unless contained in a drainage easement obtained by the developer. 
                  b.  Reduce the regulatory flood storage capacity. All compensation shall occur either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed, or within a permanent, recorded flood control easement (which shall be a part of the record), and shall be within a reasonable proximity to the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain; lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain; or raising of the regulatory flood elevation within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed. All cut areas are to be graded to a slope of no less than two percent. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from widening or relocation of the stream channel. A step-backwater analysis will be required to determine volume of flood storage created by raising the regulatory flood elevation. 
                  c.  Change the flow characteristics of the waters of the regulatory flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the property. Verification shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis. 
                  d.  Create hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or result in excessive sedimentation. A natural channel may be widened or otherwise improved provided the bottom and sides are permanently stabilized either by pavement, or by some other means acceptable to the City. Such measures shall be defined and constructed so as to provide a minimum velocity for normal low flows of at least 2½ feet per second. In all cases effective transitions must be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are neither increased nor decreased. 
                  (2)  Public utilities and facilities. All proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
                  (3)  Approval of revisions. Any significant changes or revisions to the floodplain as shown on any FEMA maps shall be submitted to FEMA for approval. The revisions shall be approved by FEMA before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. Significant changes or revisions shall be defined as any change to the FEMA floodplain map easily observed when plotted at a scale of one inch equals 1,000 feet. The changes or revisions may be due to, but are not limited to, more current and/or superior topographic information or compensatory cut and fill grading done as a part of the development. 
                  (d)  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments . An engineering study is required (as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site) whenever a development proposes to disturb the regulatory floodplain. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the state and made a part of the application for a land disturbance permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the floodplain. 
                  (1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development. 
                  (2)  Any report that must be submitted to FEMA for review, in accordance with this article, must use HEC-RAS or HEC-2 for step-backwater analysis. Cross sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained from FEMA whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FEMA results and HEC-RAS or HEC-2 will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood and regulatory flood profiles. 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions must be provided to show that regulatory floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development. 
                  (4)  If changes to the regulatory flood elevation are proposed, profiles of the channel showing the existing and proposed regulatory flood elevations must be provided. 
                  (5)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all floodplain encroachments. 
                  (e)  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The City may direct the property owner (at no cost to the City) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not, in the opinion of the City pursuant to the approved plans and floodplain report on file with the City, performed satisfactory maintenance.

                  Sec. 10-230. - Standards for building construction. 
                  (a)  Structures and buildings authorized in or adjacent to the floodplain. 
                  (1)  Where prohibited. New construction of principal buildings, including manufactured homes, shall not be allowed within the limits of the floodplain. 
                  (2)  Residential buildings. For new construction or substantial improvement of any principal residential building or manufactured home, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement and access to the building, shall be at least three feet above the level of the highest base flood (100-year) elevation adjacent to the building or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation whichever is highest. 
                  (3)  Nonresidential buildings. 
                  a.  New construction. For new construction of any principal nonresidential building, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement and access to the building, shall be at least one foot above the level of the highest base flood (100-year) elevation adjacent to the building or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation whichever is highest. 
                  b.  Substantial improvements. Substantial improvements to existing principal nonresidential buildings may be authorized by the City to be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building below the regulatory flood elevation are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer shall certify to the City that the standards of this article are satisfied and shall provide the City any applicable documentation upon request. 
                  (4)  Accessory and non-habitable buildings and structures. Accessory and non-habitable structures (i.e., barns, sheds, gazebos, and other similar structures) which are permitted to be located within the limits of the floodplain under the provisions of the zoning resolution shall be designed and constructed to pass all floodwater in a manner consistent with this article. 
                  (5)  Drainage structures and impoundments. Drainage structures and impoundments may be authorized provided they are designed and constructed pursuant to the requirements of the development regulations of the City are approved by the City and are consistent with the requirements of this article. Detention facilities may be located within the regulatory floodplain if the regulatory flood storage capacity is not reduced by the dam and water impounded behind the dam as required in section 10-229(c). 
                  (b)  Building permit requirements. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for a site which contains or is adjacent to the floodplain, a drawing which shows the elevation of the proposed lowest floor of the building, including basement, the limits of the floodplain, and the highest regulatory flood elevation and base flood (100 year) elevation adjacent to the building, must be submitted to the City for approval. Proposed grading encroachments must be shown on this drawing. Elevations shall be referenced to an accurate topographical reference (e.g., a recorded final plat whereon the regulatory and the base floodplain is shown). 
                  (c)  Construction stage. 
                  (1)  Upon completion of construction of the lowest floor of any building permitted under subsection (a) of this section, the permit holder shall submit to the City a certification of the as-built floor elevation. This requirement shall not apply, however, if the separation between the lowest floor elevation and the regulatory flood elevation shown on the drawing submitted as part of the permit application is greater than ten feet. Said certification shall be prepared by a land surveyor currently registered in the state. 
                  (2)  Any work undertaken prior to submission and approval of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. No framing inspection shall be completed or approved by the City until such required certification is received and verified by the City. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall cause to issue a stop work order for the project. 
                  (d)  Provisions for flood hazard reduction. All new construction, or substantial improvement of existing structures, which is located less than three feet above the highest adjacent base flood elevation or below the regulatory flood elevation, whichever is highest, shall comply with the following: 
                  (1)  Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
                  (2)  Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
                  (3)  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be constructed or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (4)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
                  (5)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.

                  Sec. 10-231. - Appeal and waiver procedures. 
                  (a)  Appeals. Appeals from the interpretation or requirements of this article shall be made in accordance with the procedures and requirements contained in this article. 
                  (b)  Evaluation of waiver requests. 
                  (1)  In passing upon waiver applications for relief from the provisions of this article, the City council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this article, and the: 
                  a.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
                  b.  Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
                  c.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
                  d.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
                  e.  Necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility; 
                  f.  Availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
                  g.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
                  h.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and any floodplain management program for that area; 
                  i.  Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
                  j.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
                  k.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
                  (2)  Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section, and the stated purposes of this article, the City council may attach such conditions to the granting of a waiver as it deems necessary to further said purposes. 
                  (3)  Waivers shall not be approved within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the regulatory or the base flood discharge would result, except and to the extent that may be allowed by FEMA. 
                  (c)  Historic structures. Waivers from the requirements of this article may be administratively approved by the City for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, and provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical designation, and provided further that the requirements of subsection (e) of this section are met. 
                  (d)  Conditions for waiver approval. 
                  (1)  Waivers shall only be approved upon a determination that the waiver is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building; 
                  (2)  Waivers shall only be issued upon a finding of the following: 
                  a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the waiver would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of the waiver will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (3)  No waiver from the provisions of this article may be approved which would allow a structure or use of land otherwise prohibited in the flood hazard area under the provisions of the zoning resolution. 
                  (e)  Records and reports. The City shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any waivers to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

                  (a)  Use of estimated information for returns. All occupation taxes levied hereunder are computed on the volume of business to be conducted during the current calendar year.

This return shall be used as the basis for making estimated payments on the tax due for the current calendar year. The final actual amount of tax payable in a calendar year shall be computed and paid based upon the final return of taxable gross receipts to be made after the end of the year. 
                  (b)  Final returns. The owner or responsible official of each business subject to the occupation tax shall, after the end of the taxable year, and on or before March 31 or the due date established by the licensing and revenue manager of the ensuing year, file with the manager or his/her designee(s) a signed application and return, in the form required, setting forth the amount of gross receipts for the business for the preceding calendar year.

                  (c)  Part year returns. Where the business subject to the tax levied herein has been conducted for less than the full preceding calendar year, the amount of actual gross receipts shall be included on the return. Such return shall also include a figure that, when combined with the actual receipts, will be a reasonable estimate of an annualized, whole-year gross receipts. 
                  (d)  Newly established businesses. In the case of a newly established business subject to occupation tax in the current year, and for which no business was conducted within the City in the previous calendar year, the owner or responsible official shall, on or before actual commencement of business, file a return estimating the gross receipts for the current calendar year, and the tax shall be computed thereon. The tax shall become due 30 days from filing of the return, and shall be delinquent if not paid within 30 days of the due date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a lawyer begins business after January 1 of the occupation tax year, the tax and administrative fee on such business shall be due and payable on December 31 of the year in which the business begins. 
                  (e)  False or fraudulent returns or estimates. Failure to supply complete or accurate information is punishable as specified within this chapter. 
                  (f)  Dates. Filing or payment dates may be extended upon written order of the licensing and revenue manager.

                  (b)  If the amount of occupation tax required herein, computed based upon the final return, is more than the amount of occupation tax previously paid by the business based upon an estimated filing, the difference amount shall be due and payable not later than March 31 of the year following the year in which the tax was incurred, and shall become delinquent if not so paid. 
                  (c)  If the amount paid for occupation tax during the immediately preceding year, computed on the estimated gross receipts for the period, is more than the amount due as computed upon the final actual return, the overpayment difference shall be refundable to the business, or alternately, if the business enterprise remains in existence, the overpayment may be credited towards the estimated occupation tax due for the current year upon providing a final Federal Income Tax Return. 
                  (d)  It shall be the duty of the licensing and revenue manager to at least annually provide a statement of estimated and final tax computations, along with a schedule of payments and final status of the account of each business for the immediately preceding year. 
                  (e)  Refunds. Refund of the occupation tax shall be permitted where there has occurred a clerical error in the submission of a return or application, or where there has been discovered a clerical error in business classification or tax computation, or where there has been a voluntary or involuntary overpayment of the tax. Written requests for refund of the occupation tax or any part thereof must be filed with the licensing and revenue manager by the owner or responsible business official, and the request shall set forth a detailed justification for claim for refund. The administrative fee is nonrefundable. 
                  (f)  Evidence of gross receipts generated during any period may be substantiated by any financial document that evidences the total gross receipts for the immediately preceding year for entities engaging in an occupation, profession, or business for revenue raising purposes and that is deemed appropriate by the licensing and revenue manager or his/her designee(s); and shall be required to be submitted upon request.

                  a.  Contrary to law or ordinances; 
                  b.  Unsupported by substantial evidence on the records as a whole; or 
                  c.  Unreasonable. 
                  (5)  The findings of the alcohol license and permit appeal board shall be final unless appealed within 30 days of the date of such finding by certiorari to the superior court of the county.

As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  The intent of the mayor and council in enacting this article is to regulate the sale of goods and services by canvassing or soliciting at the residence in the City, to the end that criminal activity in the City and abusive techniques utilized by any such canvasser or solicitor, which adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare in the City, will be curtailed.

Instead, this article is intended to balance competing interest, reduce criminal activity and protect City citizens from abusive sales techniques versus the conduct of proper commercial sales activity. This article is not intended to allow any business activity which would otherwise be unlawful.

                  a.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  b.  If the repair, alternation, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alternation, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. tit. 41, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Cost of repair, alternation, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, improved, vacated and closed, or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (6)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sale proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the City are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (7)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  a.  The lien provided for in subsection (c)(7) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(g). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collection of real property ad valorem tax, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the City. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  b.  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq., unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  c.  The City may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property of the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  d.  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alternation, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  e.  The public officers designated herein may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this section. 
                  f.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the City to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. 
                  (d)  Determination by public officer that under existing ordinances dwellings, buildings, or structures are vacant and sample conditions of nuisances. 
                  (1)  The public officer may determine, under existing ordinances, that a dwelling, building, or structure is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use if he finds that conditions exist in such building, dwelling, or structure which are dangerous or injurious to the health, safety, or morals of the occupants of such dwelling, building, or structure; of the occupants of neighborhood dwelling, buildings, or structures; or of other residents of the City. Such conditions include the following (without limiting the generality of the foregoing): 
                  a.  Defects therein increasing the hazards of fire, accidents or other calamities; 
                  b.  Lack of adequate ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities; 
                  c.  Dilapidation; 
                  d.  Disrepair; 
                  e.  Structural defects; 
                  f.  Uncleanliness; and 
                  g.  Other additional standards which may from time to time be adopted and referenced herein by ordinance amendment. 
                  (2)  The public officer may determine, under existing ordinances, that a dwelling, building, or structure is vacant, dilapidated, and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes based upon personal observation or report of a law enforcement agency and evidence of drug crime being committed. 
                  (e)  Powers of public officers. The public officer designated in this section shall have the following powers: 
                  (1)  To investigate the dwelling conditions in the City in order to determine which dwellings, buildings, or structures therein are unfit for human habitation or are unfit for current commercial, industrial, or business use or are vacant, dilapidated, and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes;

                  (3)  To enter upon premises for the purpose of making examinations; provided, however, that such entries shall be made in such manner as to cause the least possible inconvenience to the persons in possession; 
                  (4)  To appoint and fix the duties of such officers, agents, and employees as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this section; and 
                  (5)  To delegate any of his functions and powers under this section to such officers and agents as he may designate.
