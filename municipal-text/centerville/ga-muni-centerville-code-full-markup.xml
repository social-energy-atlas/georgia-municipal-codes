PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Centerville, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code, as updated through August 18, 2009, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and Deborah J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Rebecca L. Tydings, City Attorney; Krista Bedingfield, City Clerk; and Cinnamon Adams, Administrative Assistant, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  Editor's note— Printed herein is the Charter for the City of Centerville, Georgia, as adopted and set forth in 1958 Ga. Laws (Act No. 486), page 3323. Amendments to the original Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision derives unchanged from the original Charter. The format of the Charter, including section numbers, has been retained. The directory provisions of the various acts, including severability, repealer, effective date, affidavits and notices of intent, have been omitted. A uniform system of punctuation and capitalization has been used. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation and material in brackets [ ] has been added for clarity. The text of this document does not reflect subsequent amendments to state law generally or changes in city procedure that render sections of the Charter implicitly repealed or amended.

                  (1985 Ga. Laws (Act No. 475), page 4830) 
                  Editor's note— Municipalities and counties are prohibited from requiring officers or employees to be residents of the municipality or county pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 45-2-5.

                  ARTICLE VI. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 

                  Sec. 4-450. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Based on the demonstrated experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Orlando, Florida; Orange County, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Los Angeles, California; Beaumont, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Austin, Texas, which experience is found to be relevant to the problems that face the City of Centerville, Georgia, the city council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country, particularly the problems of crime, blight, and deterioration which are brought about by alcohol and live nudity. 
                  (b)  It is the finding of the city council that public nudity, either partial or total, under circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment" in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. 
                  (c)  Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public indecency and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the concentration of adult entertainment establishments are depreciation of property values in neighborhoods surrounding nude bars or adult entertainment establishments where alcoholic beverages are sold, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burdens on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this subsection, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of adult establishments in particular areas. 
                  (d)  Other negative effects which were found by the city council are the apparent connection of these establishments to organized crime and illegal drug sales; the potential spread of communicable diseases to law enforcement personnel who answer calls at adult establishments and to patrons of such establishments; and the potential proliferation of adult entertainment establishments after the initial siting of an adult entertainment establishment in a particular neighborhood. 
                  (e)  The city, therefore, finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals and preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, and parks to prevent the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the city finds that the prohibition of live nude conduct in establishments licensed to serve alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare by furthering legitimate government interests, such as reducing criminal activity, protection against property devaluation and deterioration, and eliminating undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and allow and/or encourage nudity, and that such prohibition will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech. To that end, this section is hereby adopted.

                  (b)  The city may suspend or revoke the license of any business owner or operator of any other license granted by the municipality as a penalty for the conviction of the business owner or business operator of a violation of O.C.G.A. §§ 16-12-35(e), (f) or (g). 
                  (c)  The suspension or revocation of licenses under this Code section shall be in accordance with the following guidelines of due process: 
                  (1)  No license which has been issued or which may be issued pursuant to this article shall be suspended or revoked except for due cause and after hearing and upon prior three-day written notice to the holder of the license of the time, place and purpose of the hearing and a statement of the charges upon which the hearing shall be held. 
                  (2)  The term "due cause" for the purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to: 
                  a.  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics, or tax laws. 
                  b.  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any sex offense when the licensed business is for on-premises consumption. 
                  c.  Suspension or revocation of any state license required as a condition for the possession, sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages. 
                  d.  Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor. Any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented. 
                  e.  Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this article as a condition or qualification for holding a license. 
                  f.  Any other factor known to or discovered by the city whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any of the licensee's employees or any person holding an interest in a license, has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, local ordinance or administrative regulations involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics for all alcohol licensed businesses and including any sex offense under state law or local ordinances with respect to businesses licensed for on-premises consumption. With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity. 
                  (3)  Notice of suspension or revocation proceedings shall be served on the person named as licensee in the application. Notice shall be in writing. The notice may be served personally or by first class mail. If by mail, the notice shall be addressed to the licensee at its address as provided by the licensee to the municipality. The burden shall be on the licensee to provide notice, in writing, of any change of address for service of notices and process. In the case of service by mail of any notice required by this chapter, the service is complete at the time of deposit in the United States Postal Service. 
                  (4)  The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the mayor and council. The hearing officer shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the state who is disinterested in the proceeding. 
                  (5)  Hearings shall be only as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice. The city attorney shall present the city's case and bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that due cause exists to suspend or revoke the license. At the hearing the licensee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross examine all witnesses offered by the city, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the hearing officer shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation. 
                  (6)  The hearing officer shall make his final determination within ten business days of the completion of the hearing. The decision shall be placed in writing and contain the hearing officer's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision as to sanction, if any. Such sanction may include one or more of the following: Revocation of the license, suspension of the license for no more than 12 months, imposition of a probationary period not to exceed 12 months, and/or a civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount allowed under the City Charter. Progressive sanctions, depending on the severity of the violation, are encouraged but not required. Where the remaining term of the license is less than 12 months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three separate and unrelated violations within 24 months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
                  (7)  The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the city, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court. 
                  (8)  Upon receipt of notice of adverse action against the licensee under this section, the licensee may waive its right to a hearing and stipulate to a sanction, as recommended by the city attorney, in consultation with the chief of police. Any stipulation entered under this subsection shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and nonappealable.

                  State Law reference— Authority of cities and counties to restrict adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, and adult movie houses to certain areas, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3. 

                  Sec. 6-79. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  Based on the demonstrated experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Macon and Bibb County, Georgia; Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Orlando, Florida; Orange County, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Los Angeles, California; Beaumont, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Austin, Texas, which experience is found to be relevant to the problems that face Centerville, Georgia, and regarding the notorious and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country, particularly the problems of crime, blight and deterioration which are brought about by the combination of alcohol and live nudity, it is the finding of the city council that public nudity, either partial or total, in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment" in conjunction with the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages, whether sold on the premises or not, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public indecency and drug trafficking. 
                  (b)  The city, therefore, finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety, and morals and preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools and parks to prevent the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the city finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment which will not be allowed to sell or serve alcoholic beverages or permit the consumption on the premises. The city finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interest, such as reducing criminal activity, protecting against property devaluation and deterioration, and eliminating undesirable community conditions, and that such regulations will not unduly infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Classified dog means any dog that has been classified as either a dangerous dog or vicious dog pursuant to this article. 
                  Dangerous dog means any dog that: 
                  (1)  Causes a substantial puncture of a person's skin or the skin of a pet of a person by teeth without causing serious injury; provided, however, that a nip, scratch, or abrasion shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subparagraph. 
                  (2)  Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury to such person or another person although no such injury occurs; provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling, or showing of teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subparagraph; or 
                  (3)  While off the owner's property, kills a pet animal; provided, however, that this subparagraph shall not apply where the death of such pet animal is caused by a dog that is working or training as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator control dog. 
                  Owner means any natural person or any legal entity, including, but not limited to, a corporation, partnership, firm or trust owning, possessing, harboring, keeping, or having custody or control of a dog. In the case of a dog owned by a minor, the term "owner" includes the parents or person in loco parentis with custody of the minor. 
                  Proper enclosure means an enclosure for keeping a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog, while on the owner's property, securely confined indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked pen, fence or structure suitable to prevent the entry of young children and designed to prevent the dog from escaping. Any such pen or structure shall have secure sides and a secure top. If the dog is enclosed within a fence, all sides of the fence shall be of sufficient height and the bottom of the fence shall be constructed or secured in such a manner as to prevent the dog's escape either from over or from under the fence. Any such enclosure shall also provide protection from the elements for the dog. 
                  Serious injury means any physical injury that creates a substantial risk of death; results in death, broken or dislocated bones, lacerations requiring multiple sutures, or disfiguring avulsion; requires plastic surgery or admission to a hospital; or results in protracted impairment of health, including transmission of an infection or contagious disease, or impairment of the function of any bodily organ. 
                  Vicious dog means a dog that inflicts serious injury on a person or the pet of a person or causes serious injury to a person or the pet of a person resulting from reasonable attempts to escape from the dog's attack.

Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or mayor, the affairs and business of the city may be conducted at places other than the regular or usual location, within or outside of the city, when it is not prudent, expedient or possible to conduct business at the regular location. When such meetings occur outside of the city, all actions taken by the city governing authority shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the city. Such meetings may be called by the presiding officer or any two members of the governing body without regard to or compliance with time-consuming procedures and formalities otherwise required by law. 
                  (b)  Public works contracts. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or mayor, the city may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest, responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract for four weeks; provided, however, that the emergency must be of such nature that immediate action is required and that the action is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. Any public works contract entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be entered on the minutes of the city as soon as practical and the nature of the emergency described therein in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22(e). 
                  (c)  Purchasing. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or mayor, the purchasing ordinances, regulations or policies may be suspended. City officials shall continue to seek to obtain the best prices during the state of local emergency. 
                  (d)  Code enforcement. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the mayor, the city governing authority may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the ordinances of the city, or any portion thereof, where the emergency is of such nature that immediate action outside the Code is required, such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations. 
                  (e)  Fees. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the mayor, the city may temporarily reduce or suspend any permit fees, application fees or other rate structures as necessary to encourage the rebuilding of the areas impacted by the disaster or emergency.

                  (1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  (2)  The market value of the structure should be: 
                  a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  (3)  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  (4)  The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
                  a.  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.  Any alteration of an historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

                  Sec. 20-21. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the city, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Code 1992, § 8-2; Ord. No. 2007-5, art. 1, § B, 10-16-2007) 
                  Sec. 20-22. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater as follows: 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 20-76(4), pertaining to elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, including ductwork, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this subsection and in section 20-51(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers, or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See section 20-77(6).) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)c of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 20-25 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
                  (Code 1992, § 8-56; Ord. No. 2007-5, art. 4, § B, 10-16-2007)

                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 20-25, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 20-25, then the article administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement, elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: The lowest floor is required to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 20-76(4), pertaining to elevated buildings. 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, including ductwork, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  (a)  The board of zoning appeals as established by the city council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and make recommendations on appeals to the city council who shall then decide on the appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the article administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council's adoption, rejection, or modification of the board of zoning appeals may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing and making recommendations to the city council on such requests, the board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances are as follows: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The article administrator and/or city clerk shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this article, the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to its recommendation in favor of granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Sec. 20-128. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/ BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with section (b)(2) below or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c)(15)—(17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) and (17) of this section, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in [EPD Rule] 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-7, exh. A, 6-1-2010; Ord. No. 2018-2, 3-6-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 20-129. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Centerville without first obtaining a permit from the city clerk's office to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city clerk and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 20-128(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) and (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 20-128(c)(15)—(17), have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 20-128(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by sections 20-128(c)(15)—(17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 20-129(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-7, exh. A, 6-1-2010; Ord. No. 2010-9, 7-6-2010; Ord. No. 2018-2, 3-6-2018 ) 
                  Sec. 20-130. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The director of operations or his designee will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The director of operations or his designee shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 20-131. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 20-129(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)  Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any City Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  ARTICLE IV. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE 

                  Sec. 20-152. - Conflicting provisions. 
                  If any of the provisions of this article conflict with any other provisions, including zoning provisions, of this Code, the more stringent regulation shall be applicable. 
                  Sec. 20-153. - Lot sizing; criteria for protection. 
                  (a)  Minimum lot sizing requirements. 
                  (1)  Permit required. No building permit shall be issued for a building, structure, or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank, unless the building conforms to the requirements of these regulations. The city shall require a site plan or preliminary subdivision plan in sufficient detail to review the proposed development for compliance with the provisions of this section of the comprehensive development regulations. 
                  (2)  County health department approval of permit required. No building permit shall be issued for a building, structure or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank, unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the state department of human resources, "Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems" (hereinafter DHR manual) and this article. 
                  (3)  Minimum lot size. 
                  a.  Lot size requirements are as follows for single-family dwellings including, but not limited to, manufactured or mobile homes, stick built homes, modular homes, etc.; lots in subdivisions, and for each mobile home located in a mobile home park. Multifamily dwellings on a single recorded lot, where not prohibited by local zoning, must be provided in multiples of the following minimum lot sizes for each residence offered for rent or sale on the recorded lot. The lot size for nonresidential facilities shall be based on the proposed sewage flow. All minimum lot sizes shall be based on table MT-1 and table MT-2 summarized in subparagraphs 81.3.1—81.3.6 of the DHR manual and this subsection as follows: 

                   
                  1 In this context, the term "nonpublic" means an individual water supply system or any other water supply system which is not a public water supply system. 
                  2 Gpad means gallons per acre per day or gal/acre/day. 
                  b.  The minimum lot sizes in this subsection (a)(3) are for the typical size home (four bedrooms) with basic appurtenances such as driveway, minimum number of trees, and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed to be constructed or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the county board of health will require larger lots to ensure useable soil area. 
                  c.  The county board of health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features. 
                  d.  Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively. 
                  e.  The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements, such as power line or pipe line, that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors. 
                  f.  There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system. This will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent city zoning setbacks and/or other city or county space requirements must also be met. 
                  g.  The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by a nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by a public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Examples: 
                  1.  Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine X = the square footage of the lot needed, use the following formula: 

                   
                  2.  Assume a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine Y = the square footage of the lot needed for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula: 

                   
                  (b)  Criteria for protection of groundwater recharge areas. 
                  (1)  Significant recharge areas in the city shall be determined by using the state department of natural resources Hydrologic Atlas 18 map. Each significant recharge area in the city shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium (average), or low based on the state department of natural resources Hydrologic Atlas 20 map. Both of these maps are hereby adopted and made a part of these regulations as if fully set forth herein. 
                  (2)  Rules of the department of natural resources, environmental protection division, chapter 391-3-16-.02 require the following minimum lot sizes in the state groundwater recharge areas as defined in subsection (b)(1) of this section are as follows: 
                  a.  Individual lots and subdivisions. New residences served by septic tank and absorption field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified in table MT-1 of the DHR manual: 
                  1.  150 percent of the minimum lot size of table MT-1 if the lot is within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  2.  125 percent of the minimum lot size of table MT-1 if the lot is within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
                  3.  110 percent of the minimum lot size of table MT-1 if the lot is within a low susceptibility area. 
                  b.  Mobile home parks. New mobile home parks served by septic tank and absorption field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified in table MT-2 of the DHR manual: 
                  1.  150 percent of the minimum lot size of table MT-2 if the lot is within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  2.  125 percent of the minimum lot size of table MT-2 if the lot is within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
                  3.  110 percent of the minimum lot size of table MT-2 if the lot is within a low susceptibility area. 
                  c.  Agricultural waste impoundment sites. New agricultural waste impoundment sites in a significant recharge area, specified as follows, shall contain a liner consisting of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than five times 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the natural resource and conservation service: 
                  1.  Any agricultural waste impoundment site located in a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  2.  Any agricultural waste impoundment site within a average or medium pollution susceptibility area which exceeds 15 acre-feet; or 
                  3.  Any agricultural waste impoundment site within a low pollution susceptibility area that exceeds 50 acre-feet. 
                  d.  Aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks. New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks having a minimum volume of 660 gallons shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  e.  Hazardous materials handling facilities. New facilities that handle hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, 42 USC 6901 et seq., excluding underground storage tanks, and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and any adopted city fire code requirements. 
                  f.  Stormwater infiltration basins. Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in significant recharge areas having high pollution susceptibility. 
                  g.  Exemption. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be exempt from the minimum lot size requirements of this section. No subdivision plat shall be recorded after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived until and unless said plat has been reviewed and approved by the city as being in compliance with the minimum lot sizes established by this section. 
                  h.  Effective date. These regulations shall be effective on December 6, 2005. 
                  i.  Uses served by a private (nonpublic) water supply system. All uses served by a private (nonpublic) water supply system, regardless of zoning district, shall have a minimum lot area of 43,560 square feet. Such lots shall have a minimum lot width of 150 feet and maximum lot coverage of 25 percent. 
                  j.  Uses served by a public water supply system by zoning district and use. Within the zoning districts listed herein, the following requirements shall apply: 
                  1.  Single-family and two-family residential dwelling units. With use districts permitting single-family and two-family residential dwelling units, the following minimum lot areas, minimum lot widths and maximum lot coverage shall apply: 

                   
                  (1) Does not apply to lots of record 
                  2.  Multifamily residential dwelling units. 
                  (i)  Basic minimum lot area. Within use districts permitting multifamily dwellings, the basic minimum lot area shall be 7,500 square feet in R-3 multifamily residential district, and 10,000 square feet in commercial districts, or shall be greater based on the following minimum lot area and maximum lot coverage requirements, except as otherwise provided herein: 

                   
                  (1) For C-2 general commercial district, subject to conditional approval of the commission. 
                  (ii)  Minimum lot width. Within use districts permitting multifamily residential dwelling units, the minimum lot width measured at the building line shall be 85 feet. 
                  (iii)  Public sewers required. All multifamily dwelling units shall be connected to a public sewer. No septic tanks or other methods of disposing of waste will be permitted in any multifamily dwelling unit developments. 
                  (iv)  Commercial, industrial and other uses. Within the C-1 neighborhood commercial and M-1 wholesale and light industrial districts, the minimum lot area for each permitted use shall be 10,000 square feet. All other commercial, industrial and other uses have no minimum requirement for lot area. 
                  k.  Minimum setbacks. Within the zoning districts herein defined, the following minimum setback requirements shall apply: 

                   
                  1.  Lots in significant recharge areas serviced by septic tanks shall meet EPD chapter 391-3-16-02 requirements. See section 2.1 and 2.2. 
                  2.  All single-family attached and semidetached dwellings shall be connected to a public or community sewer system. No septic tanks or other method of disposing of wastewater will be permitted.

                  ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER DESIGN STANDARDS 

                  Sec. 20-175. - Local design manual. 
                  (a)  Forward. The local design manual (LDM) is meant to serve as a comprehensive guide to implementing stormwater management systems in the city. Additionally, the LDM is designed to supplement the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM) and all subsequent updates or revisions, which shall serve as the technical manual for design and specification of individual components within the system. 
                  (b)  General level of service standards. 
                  (1)  Detention requirements. 
                  a.  Discharge rates from new development projects. Development plans, including site grading and drainage plans, should be developed to minimize disruption of natural drainage patterns on properties as well as to minimize impacts to downstream drainage infrastructure and structures. Whenever a hydrologic and hydraulic report, as defined in subsection (f) of this section, indicates a potentially adverse impact resulting from development of a property, that project shall incorporate stormwater detention facilities as outlined herein. The meaning of adverse impact shall apply to situations where the post-development discharge rates, up to and including the 100-year storm event, exceed those determined for the predeveloped conditions, or where downstream conditions indicate that the conveyance and/or storage capacity of the existing infrastructure could be inundated by the post-development conditions, or where existing structures could be impacted by the postdeveloped conditions. Additionally, no increases in stormwater runoff rates shall be allowed at any discharge point on the site. The baseline or predeveloped conditions shall be a wooded undisturbed site regardless of whether any clearing has occurred in the past and shall model any depression storage and/or detention storage. The development shall be analyzed for the following storm events: 
                  1.  Two-year 24-hour design storm; 
                  2.  Five-year 24-hour design storm; 
                  3.  Ten-year 24-hour design storm; 
                  4.  25-year 24-hour design storm; 
                  5.  50-year 24-hour design storm; 
                  6.  100-year 24-hour design storm. 
                  If the total area of the site (i.e., total property area) and the drainage area to each stormwater management facility is less than one acre, then a rainfall intensity based analysis (i.e., rational method) may be performed. If detention facilities are to be designed and constructed in series, the 24-hour storm criteria will apply regardless of the drainage area. 
                  b.  Discharge rates from redevelopment projects. Development plans, including site grading and drainage plans, should be developed to minimize disruption of natural drainage patterns on properties as well as to minimize impacts to downstream drainage infrastructure and structures. Whenever a hydrologic and hydraulic report, as defined in subsection (f) of this section, indicates a potentially adverse impact resulting from development of a property, that project shall incorporate stormwater detention facilities as outlined herein. The meaning of adverse impact shall apply to situations where the post-development discharge rates, up to and including the 100-year storm event, exceed those determined for the predeveloped conditions, or where downstream conditions indicate that the conveyance and/or storage capacity of the existing infrastructure could be inundated by the post-development conditions, or where existing structures could be impacted by the post-developed conditions. Additionally, no increases in stormwater runoff rates shall be allowed at any discharge point on the site. The baseline or predeveloped conditions shall be based on an analysis of the stormwater discharge rates from the site in its existing condition and shall model any depression storage and/or detention storage. The development shall be analyzed for the following storm events: 
                  1.  Two-year 24-hour design storm; 
                  2.  Five-year 24-hour design storm; 
                  3.  Ten-year 24-hour design storm; 
                  4.  25-year 24-hour design storm; 
                  5.  50-year 24-hour design storm; 
                  6.  100-year 24-hour design storm. 
                  If the total area of the site (i.e., total property area) and the drainage area to each stormwater management facility is less than one acre, then a rainfall intensity based analysis (i.e., rational method) may be performed. If detention facilities are to be designed and constructed in series, the 24-hour storm criteria will apply regardless of the drainage area. 
                  (2)  Conveyance systems. 
                  a.  Bridges. All bridges shall be designed to accommodate the 100-year 24-hour design storm with no over topping. 
                  b.  Culverts and pipe systems. 

                   
                  Culverts with contributing drainage areas greater than ten acres shall be designed to the 24-hour storm. For example, if a cross drain is to be designed to convey stormwater runoff from a 20-acre drainage basin under a neighborhood road, then the design storm shall be a 25-year 24-hour storm. If a culvert is designed to connect to an existing system of a differing design level of service, then the system with the greater design requirement will be used to size the proposed system. 
                  c.  Inlets (catchbasins, yard inlets, drop inlets, hooded grate inlets and flumes). Inlets collecting stormwater runoff from street surfaces and area inlets shall be sized to capture the storm event specified for the pipe system to which it drains and a maximum flooding depth as determined by the following table: 

                   
                  Inlets and grading adjacent to habitable structures shall be designed to prevent stormwater runoff from entering the structure during the 100-year design storm. 
                  d.  Inlets (headwalls, flared end sections, etc. ). Inlets that utilize the opening of the pipe as the inlet (i.e., headwalls, flared end sections, etc.) shall be sized to capture the storm event specified for the pipe system to which it drains and a maximum flooding depth that will not result in bypass of the inlet or cause structural/nuisance flooding.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Document EPA-600-87-035 (Note. The drastic methodology is most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility). 
                  Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for the city. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means an area that needs the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended. 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  Pollution susceptibility map means the relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources using the drastic methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.) 
                  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  Regulated activity means any activity which will or which may reasonably be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended.

                  (Code 1992, § 9.5-33; Ord. No. 2001-10, § 3, 9-21-2001) 
                  Sec. 20-208. - Establishment of water resource districts. 
                  (a)  The city's water resource districts shall include the following: 
                  (1)  Groundwater recharge area district. 
                  (2)  Wetlands protection district. 
                  (b)  The boundaries of these water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designated as water resource districts and are included as part of the city's official zoning map, which is on file with the zoning administrator's office located in the city hall. 
                  (Code 1992, § 9.5-32; Ord. No. 2001-10, § 2, 9-21-2001) 
                  Sec. 20-209. - Groundwater recharge area district. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides, sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. 
                  (c)  District delineation. The groundwater recharge area district is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Said maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this article. 
                  (d)  Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the groundwater recharge area protection district. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
                  (1)  New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  (2)  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within: 
                  a.  A high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.  A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet in size; and 
                  c.  A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in size. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 by 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the National Resource and Conservation Service. 
                  (3)  New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR table MT-1).

                  a.  150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.  125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
                  c.  110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  (4)  New manufactured home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on table MT-2 of the Department of Human Resources' (DHR) Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR table MT-2). The minimums set forth in table MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors as set forth in sections A—F of the DHR Manual. 
                  a.  150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.  125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-2 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; and 
                  c.  110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size or space size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-2 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  (5)  No construction may proceed on a building or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the state department of human resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereinafter DHR manual) and subsections (d)(3) and (4) of this section. 
                  (6)  New facilities which handle hazardous materials, of the types (listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, 42 USC 6901 et seq., excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts 10,000 pounds or more on any one day shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and any local fire prevention code requirements. 
                  (7)  Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility. 
                  (e)  Exemptions. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, is exempt from the minimum lot size requirements contained in subsections (d)(3) and (4) of this section. 

                   
                  1 In this context, the term "nonpublic" means an individual water supply system or any other water supply system which is not a public water supply system. 
                  2 Gpad equals gallons per acre per day or gal/acre/day. 

                   
                  1 In this context, the term "nonpublic" means an individual water supply system or any other water supply system which is not a public water supply system. 
                  2 Gpad equals gallons per acre per day or gal/acre/day. 
                  (1)  The minimum lot sizes in the tables in this subsection (e) are for the typical size home (three-bedroom or four-bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed for construction or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the county board of health will require larger lots to ensure usable soil area. 
                  (2)  The county board of health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features. 
                  (3)  Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively. 
                  (4)  The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: 
                  a.  Rights-of-way of roads; 
                  b.  Easements, such as power lines or pipe lines, that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system; 
                  c.  Bodies of water; 
                  d.  Land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors. 
                  (5)  There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent county zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met. 
                  (6)  The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. An example follows: 
                  a.  Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine the square footage of the lot needed "X," use the following formula: 

                   
                  b.  Assume a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine the square footage of the lot needed "Y," for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula:

                  Sec. 20-210. - Wetlands protection district. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constrains due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide: 
                  (1)  Habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; 
                  (2)  Water quality maintenance and pollution control; 
                  (3)  Flood control; 
                  (4)  Natural resource education; 
                  (5)  Scientific study; and 
                  (6)  Recreational opportunities. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas. 
                  (c)  District delineation. The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto. The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands with the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC § 1344, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (d)  Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use except those identified in subsection (e) of this section shall be allowed within the wetland protection district without a development permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued. 
                  (e)  Permitted uses. The uses in this subsection are permitted by right within the wetland protection district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging as provided herein. (The activities listed in this subsection are exempt from section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 USC 401 et seq., a permit may be required in some circumstances.) 
                  (1)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended. 
                  (2)  Conservation or preservation soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (3)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (4)  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (f)  Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in a wetland district: 
                  (1)  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
                  (2)  Hazardous or sanitary landfills.

                  ARTICLE VII. - WATER RESOURCE PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 20-229. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Land development and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  (2)  This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants; and 
                  (3)  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites. 
                  Therefore, the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet that purpose through regulation of activities that can, through proper regulation, improve and maintain those water resources that lie partially or wholly within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. 
                  (c)  Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements. This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
                  (d)  Responsibility for administration.

If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the inspections department may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
                  (2)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 or watercourses in violation of this section may have his MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The inspections department will notify a violator of the proposed termination of his MS4 access. The violator may petition the inspections department for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits a violation of this section if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior written approval of the inspections department. 
                  (d)  Monitoring of discharges. 
                  (1)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
                  (2)  Access to facilities. 
                  a.  The inspections department shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this section as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the inspections department. 
                  b.  Facility operators shall allow the inspections department ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
                  c.  The inspections department shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the inspections department to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
                  d.  The inspections department has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
                  e.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the inspections department and shall not be replaced. The costs of cleaning such access shall be borne by the operator. 
                  f.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the inspections department access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this section. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits a violation if the person denies the inspections department reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this section. 
                  g.  If the inspections department has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this section, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  (e)  Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants. 
                  (1)  Specifications of best management practices. The city may adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility, which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or waters of the United States. 
                  (2)  Pollution prevention in new facilities. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at his own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. 
                  (3)  Pollution prevention in existing facilities. Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or watercourses. 
                  (4)  Discharge permits from regulatory agencies other than the city. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. BMPs designated for compliance with the NPDES permit or BMPs implemented as a result of action taken in compliance of this section shall be included in a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
                  (f)  Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
                  (g)  Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or water of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the inspections department in person, by phone, facsimile or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the inspections department within three business days of the phone notice. The notification of the discharge of materials to the inspections department shall be in addition to notification of other applicable city, regional, state and federal authorities. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years. 
                  (h)  Enforcement. 
                  (1)  Notice of violation. Whenever the inspections department finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this section, the inspections department may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible party. Such notice may require, without limitation: 
                  a.  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
                  b.  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
                  c.  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
                  d.  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; 
                  e.  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and 
                  f.  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. 
                  If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work may be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. 
                  (2)  Appeal of notice of violation. Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the inspections department to the superior court of the county. The notice of appeal must be received within ten days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the appropriate authority or his designee shall take place within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the reviewing authority or his designee shall be final. 
                  (3)  Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within ten days of the decision of the reviewing authority upholding the decision of the inspections department, then representatives of the inspections department shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the inspections department or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth in subsection (h)(1) of this section. 
                  (4)  Cost of abatement of the violation. Within 30 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within 30 days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the reviewing authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. 
                  (5)  Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this section. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this section, the inspections department may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation. 
                  (6)  Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this article, the city may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc. 
                  (7)  Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this section is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken. 
                  (8)  Criminal prosecution. Any person who has violated or continues to violate this section shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, and shall be subject to a criminal penalty of $2,500.00 per violation per day. The city may recover all attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement of this article, including sampling and monitoring expenses. 
                  (9)  Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this section are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative remedies. 
                  (Code 1992, § 9.5-43; Ord. No. 2005-20, art. III, §§ 1—8, 12-6-2005; Ord. No. 2006-11, § A.4., 1-10-2006) 
                  Sec. 20-232. - Post-construction stormwater runoff. 
                  (a)  General provisions. 
                  (1)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This section seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  a.  Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream and drainage channels; 
                  b.  Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality; 
                  c.  Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and 
                  d.  Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety. 
                  (2)  Applicability. This section shall be applicable to all development plan applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the inspections department under the specifications of subsection (a)(3) of this section. This section also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  a.  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that disturbs one acre or more of land; 
                  b.  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
                  c.  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the inspections department to be a hotspot land use; or 
                  d.  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in subsections (a)(2)a and b of this section if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  e.  Any development project regardless of size deemed by the inspections department that shall contribute to a known or suspected water quality or quantity impairment. 
                  (3)  Exempt activities. The following activities are exempt from this section: 
                  a.  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
                  b.  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
                  c.  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
                  d.  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the inspections department. 
                  When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project as defined in section 20-230, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be governed by special stormwater sizing criteria found in the current local stormwater design manual (LDM) on file in the office of the utilities superintendent. This criteria is dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the inspections department. 
                  (4)  Development of a local stormwater design manual (LDM). The city may furnish additional policy, criteria and information including specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article and will provide such information in the form of an LDM. The LDM will serve to supplement and/or clarify information set forth in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. The LDM a copy of which is on file in the office of the city clerk, will include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. The manual may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the city, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards during the design and permitting phase of a land development project. 
                  (b)  Permit procedures and requirements. 
                  (1)  Permit required. No landowner or land operator shall receive any of the building, grading or other land development permits required for land-disturbance activities without first meeting the requirements of this section prior to commencing the proposed activity. 
                  (2)  Application requirements. Unless specifically excluded by this section, any landowner or operator desiring a permit for a land-disturbance activity shall submit to the city a permit application on a form provided for that purpose. Unless otherwise excepted by this section, a permit application must include the minimum requirements as defined in this article or LDM in order for the permit application to be considered. 
                  (3)  Application review fees. The city may require the submittal of a review fee for review of the stormwater management plan, as provided in the city fee schedule in chapter 22. This review fee shall be based on the amount of land to be disturbed at the site. Fees charged for review of the submitted stormwater management plan shall include, but not be limited to, the fees charged the city by their designated engineer for such review. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to a local budgetary category to support local plan review, inspection and program administration, and all fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of any development permits. 
                  (4)  Application procedure. All applications received by the city will be received and processed in the manner outlined in chapter 66. 
                  (5)  Permit duration. Permits issued under this section shall be valid from the date of issuance through the date the inspections department notifies the permit holder that all stormwater management practices have passed the final inspection required under permit condition. Should no activity take place on the site, the permit shall expire within one year of issuance. 
                  (c)  Waivers to stormwater management requirements. 
                  (1)  Waivers for providing stormwater management. Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this section, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement. Requests to waive the stormwater management plan requirements shall be submitted to the inspections department for approval. The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions apply or the applicant presents sufficient engineering data and analysis to support his request for a waiver as determined by the local jurisdiction: 
                  a.  It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this article. 
                  b.  Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been approved by the inspections department and local ordinance, or some other legally enforceable document, that requires the implementation of the plan. 
                  c.  Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for longterm operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice. 
                  d.  The inspections department finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of a site. 
                  e.  Nonstructural practices will be used on the site that reduce: 
                  1.  The generation of stormwater from the site; 
                  2.  The size and cost of stormwater storage; and 
                  3.  The pollutants generated at the site. 
                  These nonstructural practices shall be explained in detail in the local or state design manual and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall be determined by the inspections department. 
                  (2)  Conditions of waiver. In instances where one of the conditions of subsection (c)(1) of this section applies, the inspections department may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these stormwater management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the inspections department that the waiver will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways: 
                  a.  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
                  b.  Degradation of biological functions or habitat; 
                  c.  Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; and 
                  d.  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property. 
                  (3)  Mitigation requirements for waivers. Where compliance with minimum requirements for stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the inspections department. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
                  a.  The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. 
                  b.  The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this article. 
                  c.  Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund stormwater management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic studies, and monitoring of stormwater management practices, etc.). 
                  (4)  Fee in lieu of stormwater management practices. Where the inspections department waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development, the applicant may be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the inspections department. When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a fee schedule (unless the developer and the inspections department agree on a greater alternate contribution) established by the city council. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any development permits. 
                  (5)  Dedication of land. In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with the city for the granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-site stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the city prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the development permits. 
                  (d)  General performance criteria for stormwater management. Unless judged by the inspections department to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites: 
                  (1)  All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize previous areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. 
                  (2)  All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not discharge untreated stormwater directly into a state water without adequate control of stormwater runoff. Where such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method acceptable to the inspections department. In no case shall the impact on functional values be any less than allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE) or the state department of natural resources. 
                  (3)  Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained to the maximum extent practical, by promoting infiltration through the use of structural and nonstructural methods where allowable. 
                  (4)  For new development, stormwater treatment practices shall be designed to remove pollutants to levels prescribed in the current LDM, a copy of which is on file in the office of the utilities superintendent. It is presumed that a BMP complies with this performance standard if it is: 
                  a.  Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQ); 
                  b.  Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in the LDM; 
                  c.  Constructed properly; and 
                  d.  Maintained regularly. 
                  (5)  To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the current LDM on file in the office of the utilities superintendent. 
                  (6)  Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e., fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas, etc.) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices. 
                  (7)  Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites. 
                  (8)  Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential pollutant loadings, known as hotspots, may require the use of specific structural stormwater treatment practices (STPs) and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (9)  Prior to design, applicants are encouraged to consult with the inspections department to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements. 
                  (10)  The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the LDM shall be used for sizing all stormwater management practices. 
                  (e)  Basic stormwater management design criteria. 
                  (1)  Minimum control requirements. All stormwater management practices will be designed so that the specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g., recharge, water quality, channel protection, ten-year, and 100-year) as identified in the LDM are met, unless the inspections department grants the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the inspections department reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff. 
                  (2)  Site design feasibility. Stormwater management practices for a site shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Applicants shall consult the current LDM for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a stormwater management practice. 
                  (3)  Conveyance issues. All stormwater management practices shall be designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. The current LDM, a copy of which is on file in the office of the utilities superintendent, shall provide detailed guidance on the requirements for conveyance for each of the approved stormwater management practices. 
                  (4)  Landscaping plans required. All stormwater management practices that utilize wetlands vegetation as part of the functional treatment process (e.g., constructed wetlands, etc.) must submit a separate landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the practice and how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. This plan must be prepared by an individual having a professional certification by the Society of Wetlands Scientists and has completed three projects of a similar nature that have been successfully implemented or equivalent qualifications as determined by the inspections department. 
                  (5)  Maintenance agreements. All stormwater treatment practices shall have an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed. This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and inspect the stormwater treatment practices, and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater treatment practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all stormwater treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land-disturbance activities. An example of the covenant can be found in the LDM, a copy of which is on file in the office of the utilities superintendent. 
                  (6)  Nonstructural stormwater practices. The use of nonstructural stormwater treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. Credit in the form of reductions in the amount of stormwater that must be managed can be earned through the use of nonstructural practices that reduce the generation of stormwater from the site. These nonstructural practices are explained in detail in the current LDM, a copy of which is on file in the office of the utilities superintendent, and applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of nonstructural practices must ensure that these practices are documented and remain unaltered by subsequent property owners. 
                  (f)  Requirements for stormwater management plan approval. 
                  (1)  Stormwater management plan required for all developments. No application for development will be approved unless it includes a stormwater management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated water quality impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed. This plan must be certified by a professional engineer licensed in the state and/or registered land surveyor licensed in the state and must indicate whether stormwater will be managed on site or off site and if on site, the general location and type of practices. The stormwater management plans shall be referred for comment to all other interested agencies, and any comments must be addressed in a final stormwater management plan. This final plan must be signed by a professional engineer and or a registered land surveyor licensed in the state, who will verify that the design of all stormwater management practices meet the submittal requirements outlined in the submittal checklist found in the current LDM. No development permits shall be issued until a satisfactory final stormwater management plan, or a waiver thereof, shall have undergone a review and been approved by the inspections department after determining that the plan or waiver is consistent with the requirements of this article. 
                  (2)  Stormwater management plan requirements. A stormwater management plan shall be required with all land-disturbance activity (LDA) permit applications and will include sufficient information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.) to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site (both present and future) on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. The intent of this planning process is to determine the type of stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project, and ensure adequate planning for management of stormwater runoff from future development. To accomplish this goal the applicant will prepare a design report which shall include elements sufficient to ensure compliance with this section as outlined in the current LDM, a copy of which is on file in the office of the utilities superintendent. The inspections department reserves the right to extend these requirements to ensure compliance with this section if the requirements in the current LDM prove to be insufficient. However, in these cases, the inspections department must provide a written explanation of the additional elements needed to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Performance bond/security. The city may, at its discretion, require the submittal of a performance security or bond in order to ensure that the stormwater practices are installed by the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater management plan. The amount of the installation performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the stormwater management practices approved under the permit, plus 25 percent as agreed to by the applicant and the city. The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure to complete work specified in the stormwater management plan. The installation performance security shall be released in full only upon submission of as-built plans and written certification by a professional engineer and or a registered land surveyor licensed in the state and/or registered land surveyor licensed in the state that the stormwater practice will function in accordance with the approved plan and other applicable provisions of this section. The inspections department will make a final inspection of the stormwater practice to ensure that it is in compliance with the approved plan and the provisions of this section. Provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the performance security based on the completion of various development stages may be done at the discretion of the inspections department. 
                  (g)  Construction inspection. 
                  (1)  Notice of construction commencement. The applicant must notify the city's designated engineer and the city inspections department in advance before the commencement of construction. If any violations are found, the property owner shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. No added work shall proceed until any violations are corrected and all work previously completed has received approval by agreement of the city's designated engineer and city inspections department. 
                  (2)  As-built plans. All applicants are required to submit actual as-built plans for any stormwater management practices located both on site and off site after final construction is completed in a format specified in the current LDM, a copy of which is on file in the office of the utilities superintendent. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer licensed in the state. A final inspection by the city's designated engineer is required before the release of any performance securities can occur. 
                  (3)  Landscaping and stabilization requirements. Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared or removed by development activities shall be revegetated within ten days from the substantial completion of such clearing and construction. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts: 
                  a.  Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established over 90 percent of the seeded area. 
                  b.  Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion. 
                  c.  Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of 75 percent of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum 75 percent survival for one year is achieved. 
                  In addition to the requirements of this subsection (g), a landscaping plan must be submitted with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and management techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed in accordance with other such requirements in this Code. This plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved. 
                  (h)  Maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities. 
                  (1)  Maintenance easement. Prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy or final plat that has a stormwater management facility as part of the project, the applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the inspections department, or their contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this article. 
                  (2)  Maintenance covenants. Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the inspections department and the city council and recorded into the final plat prior to final approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled cleanouts. The city, in lieu of a maintenance covenant, may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this article and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance. 
                  (3)  Requirements for maintenance covenants. Stormwater management facilities may be required to undergo annual inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this article and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include: 
                  a.  Removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catchbasins, inlets and drainage pipes; 
                  b.  Grass cutting and vegetation removal; and 
                  c.  Necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. 
                  Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a timely manner, as determined by the inspections department, and the inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management facility. The requirement for such inspections shall be outlined in the maintenance covenant. 
                  (4)  Inspection of stormwater facilities. 
                  a.  Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis, including, but not limited to: 
                  1.  Routine inspections; 
                  2.  Inspections;

                  4.  Inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; 
                  5.  Inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES stormwater permit; and 
                  6.  Joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. 
                  b.  Inspections may include, but are not limited to: 
                  1.  Reviewing maintenance and repair records; 
                  2.  Sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and 
                  3.  Evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater treatment practices. 
                  (5)  Right of entry for inspection. When any new drainage control facility is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between private property and a public drainage control system or sanitary sewer, the property owner shall grant to the inspections department the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this article is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article. 
                  (6)  Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records for at least three years. These records shall be made available to the inspections department during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon request. 
                  (7)  Failure to maintain practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant, the city, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the inspections department shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner and within the established deadline. After proper notice, the city may assess the owners of the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes by the city. 
                  (i)  Enforcement and penalties. 
                  (1)  Violations. Any development activity that is commenced or is conducted contrary to this article may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law. 
                  (2)  Notice of violation. When the inspections department determines that an activity is not being carried out in accordance with the requirements of this article, the inspections department shall issue a written notice of violation to the owner of the property. The notice of violation shall contain: 
                  a.  The name and address of the owner or applicant; 
                  b.  The address when available or a description of the building, structure or land upon which the violation is occurring; 
                  c.  A statement specifying the nature of the violation; 
                  d.  A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the development activity into compliance with this article and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial action; 
                  e.  A statement of the penalty that shall or may be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed as provided herein; and 
                  f.  A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to the city by filing a written notice of appeal within three days of service of notice of violation. 
                  Persons receiving a notice of violation may be required to halt all construction activities via a stop work order. 
                  (3)  Stop work orders. This stop work order will be in effect until the inspections department confirms that the development activity is in compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to address a notice of violation in a timely manner as determined by the inspections department can result in civil, criminal, or monetary penalties in accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in this article. 
                  (4)  Civil and criminal penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article shall be punished by a fine of not less than $2,500.00.

                  Sec. 34-31. - Procedure for declaring dwelling unfit. 
                  (a)  (1)  Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the municipality charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure or property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract or parcel of property on which such dwelling, building or structure [is located]. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction as determined by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain and at a place within the city where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days, nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for the hearing; 
                  (2)  If, after such notice and hearing the court determines that the dwelling, building or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  a.  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improved such dwelling, building or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  b.  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq., qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the city. 
                  (3)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building or structure the public officer may cause such dwelling, building or structure to be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or section 34-32 of this article, or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted in the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (4)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; and 
                  (5)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (b)  (1)  The lien provided for in subsection (e) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(c) and subsection 34-30(b) of this article. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  (2)  Upon final determination of costs, fees and expenses incurred in accordance with this article, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this article shall transmit to the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition or closure. It shall be the duty of the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. A county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to the article in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county or municipality whose lien is being collected. 
                  (3)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
                  (4)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this article shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this article together with interest, penalties and costs incurred by the governing authority, county tax commissioner, municipal tax collector, or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (c)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (d)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement or demolition of a dwelling, building or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (e)  In addition to the procedures and remedies in this chapter, a governing authority may provide by ordinance that designated public officer may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article. 
                  (f)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings.

                  b.  Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred, or conveyed by the owner or parties at interest at any time prior to the termination of the three-year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the city; and 
                  c.  Should the amount due on such lien, or any portion thereof, be unpaid after the passage of the three-year period, or upon the occurrence of the contingency provided for in subsection (2)b of this section, the city may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for alteration, repair, removal, or demolition of dwellings, buildings, or structures in the same manner as provided in O.C.G.A § 48-5-358 and other applicable state statutes.

                  Sec. 34-115. - Manner of giving notice in abatement proceedings. 
                  (a)  Complaints or orders issued by a public officer or public authority pursuant to this article shall, in all cases, be served upon each person in possession of the property, each owner, and each party in interest; and the return of service signed by the public officer, the public authority, or his agent or an affidavit of service executed by any citizen of the state, reciting that a copy of such complaint or orders was served upon each person in possession of the property, each owner, and each party in interest personally or by leaving such copy at the place of his residence, shall be sufficient evidence as to the service of such person in possession, owner, and party in interest. 
                  (b)  If any of the owners and parties in interest shall reside out of the city, service shall be perfected by causing a copy of such complaint or orders to be served upon such party by the sheriff or any lawful deputy of the city of the residence of such party or such service may be made by any citizen; and the return of such sheriff or lawful deputy or the affidavit of such citizen that such party were served either personally or by leaving a copy of the complaint or orders at the residence shall be conclusive as to such service.

                  (e)  In the event the whereabouts of any owner or party in interest is unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the public officer or public authority in the exercise of reasonable diligence and the public officer or public authority shall make an affidavit to that effect, then the service of such complaint or order upon such persons shall be made in the same manner as provided in subsection (c) of this section or service may be perfected upon any person holding itself out as an agent for the property involved. 
                  (f)  A copy of the complaint or orders shall also be filed in the proper office for the filing of lis pendens notice in the city in which the dwelling, building, or structure is located and such filing of the complaint or orders shall have the same force and effect as other lis pendens notices provided by law. Any such complaint or orders or an appropriate lis pendens notice may contain a statement to the effect that a lien may arise against the described property and that an itemized statement of such lien is maintained on a lien docket maintained by the city clerk.

                  (Code 1992, app. A, §§ 32(64)—(68), 97-2; Ord. No. 2009-5, § 97.2, 8-18-2009) 
                  Sec. 46-2. - Findings, purpose, and intent. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The mayor and council find that: 
                  (1)  Signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law, however, an improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public. 
                  (2)  The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrians and vehicular traffic. 
                  (3)  Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly and safely designed business environment. 
                  (4)  Through proper regulation of signs, the aesthetic attractiveness and economic well-being of the city will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business. 
                  (5)  Concerns about aesthetic and safety issues as balanced with concerns about freedom of expression or speech are reasonably promoted in the city by the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (6)  Some signage has a single targeted function and identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of providing addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Signs at the entrances to subdivisions or major developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners. Holiday decorations such as strings of light are not signs, but rather seasonal ornamentation not controlled by this chapter. 
                  (b)  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this chapter is: 
                  (1)  To promote the mental and physical health, safety and welfare of the public by providing for the orderly and harmonious display of signs within the community; 
                  (2)  To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment by minimizing visual clutter, encouraging a positive visual environment, and avoiding the erection of displays which produce deleterious and injurious effects to adjacent properties and to the natural beauty of the environment; 
                  (3)  To provide for the safety of the traveling public, both vehicular and pedestrian, by limiting distractions, hazards, and obstructions; 
                  (4)  To maintain the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth and to aid in the identification of properties and enterprises for the convenience of the public; 
                  (5)  To protect the area of the city designated for a centralized mixed-use pedestrian friendly downtown area from incompatible signage; 
                  (6)  To encourage the effective use of signs as a means for communication in the city by allowing the maximum amount of expression or speech consistent with the compatibility of such expression or speech with other land uses and with the aesthetic and public health, safety and welfare concerns which the city is charged by law and the state constitution with preserving and protecting; 
                  (7)  To enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations while supporting the policies contained in the comprehensive plan pertaining to signage. 
                  (Code 1992, app. A, § 97-1; Ord. No. 2009-5, § 97.1, 8-18-2009) 
                  Sec. 46-3. - Computation of sign area. 
                  (a)  Generally. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the area of a sign face shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, color, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets other regulations of the city and is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
                  (b)  Area of multifaced signs. The sign area of signs with more than one sign face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces are parallel, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of the larger of the two faces. 
                  (c)  Area of monument signs. The computation of the sign area of a monument sign shall include the entire monument structure, as measured from the top to ground and side to side, upon which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors or other design elements occur. 
                  (Code 1992, app. A, § 97-3; Ord. No. 2009-5, § 97.3, 8-18-2009)

                  (3)  If illuminated, the illumination is not effectively shielded so as to prevent beams or rays of light from being directed at any portion of the traveled way and which are of such intensity or brilliance as to cause glare or to impair the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle, or which otherwise interfere with the operation of any motor vehicle. 
                  (4)  Signs located so as to obscure, or otherwise interfere with the effectiveness of any official traffic sign, signal or device. 
                  (5)  Signs located so as to obscure, or otherwise interfere with a motor vehicle operator's view of approaching, merging, or intersecting traffic. 
                  (6)  Signs which obstruct any fire escape, any means of ingress, egress, or ventilation, or prevent free passage from one part of a roof to any other part thereto; signs attached in any manner to a fire escape. 
                  (7)  Signs displaying any obscene message as obscenity is defined by U.S. Supreme Court decisions.

                  Sec. 46-5. - Compliance with technical codes; zoning. 
                  (a)  All signs hereafter erected, replaced, reconstructed, repaired, altered, relocated or maintained within the city shall conform to the requirements of the standard building code, chapter 23, "Signs and Outdoor Displays," and to the requirements of the National Electrical Code, article 600, "Electrical Signs and Outline Lighting," both of which are adopted by the city.

                  (d)  For joint signs, the property owner or sign contractor shall secure a permit for the sign structure as well as for the removal of individual sign panels identifying uses which no longer exist within the building covered by the joint sign. In addition to the permit required for a joint sign structure, a separate permit shall be required for each entity shown on the sign which shall be obtained by the owner, his tenant, an authorized agent, or sign contractor.

Such review shall be completed within 30 calendar days of submission of a completed sign application. If, based on review of the permit application and inspection of the site, the proposed sign is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter and all other ordinances and laws of the city, the enforcement officer shall issue a permit upon payment of permit fees no later than 30 calendar days from the receipt of the completed application. If no decision is made within 30 calendar days, the permit will be deemed approved, provided that any sign erected must comply with all sign height and location requirements of this chapter and no vesting of rights for a sign in violation of these standards shall occur. 
                  (g)  The city shall deny permits to applicants who submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this chapter, are incomplete, or contain any materially false statements. Violation of any provision of this chapter will be grounds for terminating a permit granted by the city for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of the chapter, the enforcement officer shall revoke the permit. Should the enforcement officer deny a permit, the reasons for denial shall be stated in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application on or before 30 calendar days after the city received the completed application. Alternatively, the city may personally serve the sign applicant with a copy of the written notice of denial within 30 calendar days after the city's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, instead of on the date of original submission.

Appeal notices received within seven days of a scheduled board of appeals meeting shall be heard at the next meeting more than seven days following receipt of appeal. The board of appeals shall issue a written decision to the applicant no later than 30 days following the close of the appeal hearing. If no decision is made within 30 days, the appeal will be deemed denied. Decisions of the board of appeals to affirm the decision of the building inspector or to overrule the decision of the building inspector and grant or continue the permit for which appeal is taken shall be reduced to writing and served upon the applicant in the same manner as the original notice to deny or notice of revocation. 
                  (i)  In the event an applicant whose permit has been denied or permit holder whose permit has been revoked is dissatisfied with the decision of the board of appeals, such applicant or permit holder may petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court as provided by law. 
                  (j)  Any person commencing work on a sign before securing the necessary permit from the enforcement officer shall be subject to double permit fees under the permit fee schedule.

                  b.  The number of flags allowed without permit shall not exceed two per parcel. 
                  Any flag not meeting any one or more of these standards shall be considered a banner and shall be subject to regulation as such.

                  The enforcement officer shall periodically inspect each permanent and temporary conforming and nonconforming sign in an attempt to ascertain whether the same is secure or insecure, and whether it is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or in need of repair. Responsibility for the safety of signs and security of their attachment or erection remains at all times with the sign owner. 
                  (Code 1992, app. A, § 97-14; Ord. No. 2009-5, § 97.14, 8-18-2009)

                  (a)  The enforcement officer shall cause to be removed any sign that endangers the public safety, such as an abandoned, dangerous or materially, electrically or structurally defective sign or a sign for which no permit has been issued or which is otherwise in violation of this chapter.

                  (b)  All notices mailed by the enforcement officer shall be sent by certified mail and first class mail. Any time periods provided in this section shall be deemed to commence on the date of the receipt of the certified mail, or if the first class mail is not returned, after three days of mailing.

If any of such persons is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be mailed to such person's last known address, if any, and posted on the sign or on the premises. 
                  (d)  Any person having an interest in the sign or the property may appeal the determination of the enforcement officer ordering removal or compliance by filing a written notice of appeal within ten days after receipt of notice. 
                  (e)  Notwithstanding the above, in cases of emergency, the enforcement officer may cause the immediate removal of a dangerous or defective sign without notice. 
                  (f)  Any sign removed by the enforcement officer pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The cost of removal of the sign by the city shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recoverable in the same manner as city property taxes. The cost of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sign's removal. 
                  (g)  When it is determined by the enforcement officer that the sign would cause imminent danger to the public safety, and contact cannot be made with a sign owner or building owner, no written notice shall have to be served. In this emergency situation, the enforcement officer shall document the imminent danger and attempts to contact the sign owner, and may correct the danger, all costs being charged to the sign owner and property owner. 
                  (h)  If it shall be necessary for the enforcement officer to remove a sign pursuant to the provisions of this section, and it should be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the removal, he may sell the same at private or public sale at the best price obtainable, and shall keep an account of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be used to offset the costs of removal to be charged to the sign owner or property owner. Where the proceeds derived from such a sale are less than the cost of removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located, such lien to be collectible in the same manner as city property taxes.

                  Sec. 46-17. - Noncommercial speech protected. 
                  It is not the intent of this chapter to regulate the content of speech through signage controls. To the extent any court of competent jurisdiction interprets any provision of this chapter to restrict the content of speech, it is the intent of the city council that all allowable signs may display a noncommercial message in addition to, or in lieu of, any other message.

                  Sec. 48-77. - Declaration of policy; legislative intent. 
                  (a)  It is declared to be the policy of the governing authority of the city to educate and encourage generators and handlers of solid waste to reduce and minimize to the greatest extent possible the amount of solid waste which requires collection, treatment or disposal through source reduction, reuse, composting, recycling, and other methods and to promote markets for and engage in the purchase of goods made from recovered materials and goods which are recyclable. 
                  (b)  It is further the intent of the governing authority of the city that every effort be undertaken to ensure the proper management of scrap tires from the point of generation to the ultimate point of reuse, recycling, or disposal and that every effort be made to ensure that, where possible, they be reused or recycled rather than being disposed. 
                  (c)  It is further the intent of the governing authority of the city to provide a frame of reference for the proper handling of yard trimmings. The productivity of the soils of the city requires that nature's way of recycling vegetative matter be respected and followed and that such essential building materials are no longer wasted by being buried in land fields but are returned to the soil. Therefore, the governing authority of the city adopts and recommends the following hierarchy for handling yard trimmings: 
                  (1)  Naturalized, low-maintenance landscaping requiring little or no cutting; 
                  (2)  Grass cycling by mowing it high and letting it lie; 
                  (3)  Stacking branches into brush piles for use as wildlife habitats and for gradual decomposition into the soil; 
                  (4)  Composting on the site where the material was grown, followed by incorporation of the finished compost into the soil at that site; 
                  (5)  Chipping woody material on the site where such material was generated; 
                  (6)  Collecting yard trimmings and transporting them to another site to be chipped or composted for later use; and 
                  (7)  Chipping wood material for later use as fiber fuel.

                  (c)  Street names. Street names shall require the approval of the commission. Streets that are obviously in alignment with streets already in existence and already named shall be given the name of the existing street. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or closely approximate those existing streets. 
                  (d)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted. 
                  (e)  Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs or dead-end streets shall not be greater in length than 800 feet. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a property line radius of at least 50 feet with an outside pavement radius of at least 40 feet. 
                  (f)  Development along major street, limited-access highway or railroad right-of-way. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an expressway, freeway, arterial or collector street, or a railroad right-of-way, the commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way either as a marginal access street, or at a distance suitable for an appropriate use of intervening land, with a nonaccess reservation suitably planted. Due regard should be given requirements for approach grades and future grade separations in determining distances. Lots shall have no access to expressways, freeways, or arterial streets, but only to an accessible street in which case the commission may require double-frontage lots. 
                  (g)  Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations; and where the commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.

                  (b)  City building inspector in charge; time work done. All work done under the provisions of this section shall be in charge and hereby is delegated to the city building inspector, except the matter of the application and permit hereinbefore referred to, which shall be under the jurisdiction of the city clerk. 
                  (c)  Permits; completion of work; inspections. Before any work is commenced or any walk built, an application for a permit for each separate job must be made to the city clerk, on blanks furnished for that purpose by the city, by the person who is to do and perform the work. Except for city construction projects, work contemplated under any permit must be completed within 60 days and the city building inspector must be notified at least 24 hours in advance of the commencement of operations. The city building inspector shall keep a file of the permits issued and shall make periodic inspections of the current sidewalk projects. 
                  (d)  Grade. When completed, the top surface of all sidewalks shall coincide with the grade of the space between the curbline and the street line. To take care of surface drainage, a slope of one-quarter inch per foot of width of the walk shall be required so that the water will drain towards the street. 
                  (e)  Commencement of work. All surplus earth must be removed from the job and disposed of within seven days after the sidewalk is installed. 
                  (f)  Foundation. The contractor shall provide a template of an approved type for checking the subgrade. This template must be the full width of the sidewalk and exact depth of the concrete and must be kept on the work site at all times. No concrete shall be laid until the foundation has been checked with this template and brought to grade. Wherever a fill is required, sand, stone, gravel or cinders shall be used. This fill must be well compacted by rolling, tamping, soaking with water or other approved methods and must extend at least six inches beyond the edges of the sidewalk. 
                  (g)  Sidewalk proper. When the grading has been completed to the satisfaction of the city, the sidewalk proper shall be laid; this shall be a layer of one course concrete, not less than four inches thick in residential districts, and not less than four inches thick in the business district. Residential driveways shall not be less than four inches thick. 
                  (h)  Concrete. The concrete shall contain not less than 5½ bags of air entrained cement with a minimum 2,500 pounds per square inch, 28 days strength, one-inch to three-inch slump aggregate, which shall be free of all impurities and deleterious material. 
                  (i)  Finishing. As soon as free mortar appears, a straight edge template shall be used as a strike off across the two forms to ensure a true surface. The work is then to be finished from a suitable bridge using a wooden trowel to compact the concrete where necessary and a steel trowel to put a smooth finish on the entire walk. The surface shall then be brushed lightly with an ordinary broom in order to give a slightly rough surface. The edges of the flags or squares shall be turned down with an edger having a radius not to exceed one-fourth inch. 
                  (j)  Forms. Forms may be wood or steel and firmly set with the inside form to the grade set by the city building inspector. 
                  (k)  Expansion joints. All concrete sidewalks shall have expansion joints at lot lines placed at right angles to the forms and extending to the bottom of the forms except where the distance between the lot lines is more than 100 feet, additional expansion joints shall be placed so that in no case the distance between expansion joints shall be more than 100 feet. All expansion joints shall be of prepared expansion paper strips not less than three-eights of an inch, nor more than one-half inch in thickness. When in place, this paper must be to the top of the finished surface of the walk. At intervals of between five feet and seven feet shall be placed steel dividers, one-fourth of an inch thick, at right angles to the forms and extending one inch into the concrete. These dividers must not be removed until the concrete is sufficiently set in order to prevent slumping. The dividers shall then be removed and a double edger used to finish the walk. 
                  (l)  Protection of walk. All completed walks must be protected by suitable barricades of a type approved by the city building inspector. The finished walk must be protected against the elements, particularly rain, to prevent pitting. Finished work must be kept wet or covered with curing compound for at least three days to allow for proper curing. All barricades must be protected by red lights or flared during darkness, by the contractor. 
                  (m)  City building inspector's stakes. The work to be done shall be staked out by the city building inspector where necessary, and any stakes broken or removed through carelessness will be replaced by the city building inspector at the estimated replacement cost. The contractor shall give 24 hours' notice when the services of an engineer are required. All shutoff boxes, manholes, coal holes, receiving basins, platforms, covers and any other fixtures must be set to the true surface of the walk before any concrete is placed. 
                  (n)  Width of walks. The width of walks shall be: 
                  (1)  In residential districts: at least four feet. 
                  (2)  In business districts: at least four feet. 
                  (o)  Patents. The contractor shall protect the city and the owner of the walk from all claims for patented articles, processes, materials, inventions and appliances used on the work.

                  The administrative procedures for installing the subdivision improvements required herein shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  When construction may begin. Construction and installation of any required public improvements as described herein shall not begin until the commission has given preliminary approval of the new subdivision. The subdivider shall then confer with the zoning enforcement officer to determine the method and estimated cost of the construction and installation of the required improvements. 
                  (2)  Inspections. During the construction and installation of the required public improvements, the zoning enforcement officer shall from time to time make field inspections and supervise said work as predetermined and agreed upon by the zoning enforcement officer and the subdivider. After completion of all the construction and installation of the required public improvements and if the said work has met the specifications as described herein, as determined by the zoning enforcement officer, the zoning enforcement officer shall notify the subdivider in writing of the approval of said work. 
                  (3)  Performance bond. If the subdivider does not wish to construct and install any required public improvements as described herein prior to submitting the subdivision plat to the commission for final approval, a performance bond shall be required, such bond being equal to the estimated cost of construction as reflected by signed contracts with represented contractors. When the work has been completed satisfactorily, the council shall release 90 percent of the funds with a letter of approval to the subdivider. The remaining ten percent shall remain in escrow for maintenance purposes. 
                  (4)  Maintenance of completed work. The subdivider shall maintain his completed work for a period of one year. The subdivider shall be required to sign a maintenance agreement with the council. A maintenance bond is to be posted in cash by the subdivider in an amount equaling ten percent of the construction cost. During the maintenance period, the zoning enforcement officer shall make a final inspection and notify the subdivider and the bonding company, or in cases where funds are being held in escrow, the cost of making such corrections shall be deducted from these funds, and the subdivider charged with any costs above the amount of escrow funds. If the work is acceptable at this time, the remaining ten percent of the escrow funds shall be released to the subdivider. 
                  (5)  Cost of improvements. 
                  a.  Subdivider's responsibility. The subdivider shall incur the cost of construction and installation of all required public improvements based on the following: 
                  1.  Streets. Incur the cost for the construction of streets up to 27 feet in pavement width from back of curb, to back of curb, or 24 feet in pavement width from edge of pavement to edge of pavement if no curbs and gutters are installed. 
                  2.  Water and sewer systems. Incur the cost for the installation of all water and sewer systems which is required to serve the new subdivision and tie in with existing water and sewer systems, based on the specifications set forth herein.

                  3.  Street signs. Entire cost. 
                  (6)  Property owner's responsibility. Whenever the council is petitioned by the property owners to upgrade an existing unpaved street to class II or I, or a class II street to class I, the property owners shall then incur the entire cost for said improvements based on the footage along the property line of each lot abutting the street which is being improved and on the requirements in subsection (5)a of this section. 
                  (7)  Estimated costs for construction and installation. The current unit prices in effect at the time of submission of plans shall be used in determining the total estimated cost for construction and installation of required public improvements in new subdivisions.

                  ARTICLE III. - TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND ANTENNAS 

                  Sec. 56-47. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Alternative tower structure means manmade trees, clock towers, bell steeples, water tanks, light poles, and similar alternative-design mounting structures that effectively camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers. 
                  Antenna or telecommunications antenna means any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio, or television communications through the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves. 
                  FAA means the Federal Aviation Administration. 
                  FCC means the Federal Communications Commission. 
                  Governing authority means the city council. 
                  Height means, when referring to a telecommunications tower, the vertical distance from grade to the highest point of the tower, grade being the average level of the preexisting or finished surface of the ground adjacent to the exterior of the tower, whichever is lower. When referring to a telecommunications antenna it means the vertical distance from the base of the antenna to its highest point. 
                  Tower or telecommunication tower means any structure that is designed or constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice, towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term "tower" or "telecommunication tower" includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative tower structures and the like. 
                  (Code 1992, app. A, § 100(4); Ord. No. 98-1, § 1, 5-5-1998; Ord. No. 2003-23A, 11-4-2003) 
                  Sec. 56-48. - Findings, purpose and intent. 
                  The city finds that the number, height, design, characteristics and location of telecommunications towers and antennas in the county directly affect the public health, safety and general welfare. The city finds that such structures are likely to substantially increase in number in the immediate future. The city further finds that such structures, when inappropriately located, have the potential to pose a danger to surrounding property owners and the general public and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the city. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address those concerns through the adoption of the regulations in this section. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the city in enacting this article are as follows: 
                  (1)  Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; 
                  (2)  Encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites; 
                  (3)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 
                  (4)  Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design, sitting, and vegetative screening; 
                  (5)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties and personal injury from tower failure and falling ice and debris through engineering, careful siting of tower structures and other requirements; 
                  (6)  Ensure compliance with applicable federal statues and regulations; 
                  (7)  Lessen traffic impacts on surrounding residential areas; and 
                  (8)  Allow new transmission towers in residential areas only if a comparable site is not available in a nonresidential area. 
                  (Code 1992, app. A, § 100(3); Ord. No. 98-1, § 1, 5-5-1998; Ord. No. 2003-23A, 11-4-2003) 
                  Sec. 56-49. - Scope of regulations. 
                  (a)  Compliance required. Except as specified in this subsection, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect, install, construct, enlarge, move, alter or convert any telecommunications tower or antenna or cause the same to be done within the city except in accordance with the provisions of this article. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all towers and antennas shall also comply with all development regulations applicable to the district in which said tower or antenna is located. 
                  (b)  Height limitations. Height limitations applicable to buildings and structures set forth elsewhere in section 66-241 shall not apply to towers and antennas which comply with this article. 
                  (c)  Public property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the governing authority shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the governing authority. 
                  (d)  Amateur radio/receive-only antennas. This chapter shall not govern any tower or any antenna that does not exceed 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator. Nor shall it govern any tower or any antenna that is used exclusively as a receive-only antenna and does not exceed 70 feet in height. 
                  (Code 1992, app. A, § 100(5); Ord. No. 98-1, § 1, 5-5-1998; Ord. No. 2003-23A, 11-4-2003) 
                  Sec. 56-50. - General regulations. 
                  The following requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas governed by this article: 
                  (1)  Application requirements. Each applicant for a telecommunications antenna or tower shall provide the planning and zoning office a survey, sealed by a surveyor registered in the state, showing the location of all lot lines, leased areas, easements, access points, structures, screening and landscaping existing on site. Each applicant shall also submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed, and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information deemed by the planning and zoning office to be necessary to assess compliance with this chapter. 
                  (2)  Siting requirements. The presence of existing uses or structures on a lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot provided said installation is otherwise in accordance with this article. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including, but not limited to, setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased parcel within such lot. 
                  (3)  Inventory requirements. Each applicant for an antenna or tower shall provide to the planning and zoning officer an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height and design of each tower. The planning and zoning officer may share such information with other applicants applying for permits under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that the planning and zoning officer is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
                  (4)  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates the reasonable satisfaction of the governing authority that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence shall be submitted at the time of application which demonstrates that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna and may consist of any of the following: 
                  a.  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  b.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  c.  Existing towers or structure do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment; 
                  d.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interferences with the applicant's proposed antenna; 
                  e.  The fees, costs, or contractual provision required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable; or 
                  f.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  (5)  Design requirements. 
                  a.  Telecommunications towers and antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or FCC, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. Said requirements shall not apply to an alternative tower structure. 
                  b.  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the maximum extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and build environment. 
                  c.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  d.  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA, FCC or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, such lighting shall be to the minimum applicable standards so as to minimize the disturbance to the surrounding views. 
                  e.  Telecommunications towers and antennas shall be entirely enclosed by a security fence not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device. This requirement shall not apply to alternative tower structures. 
                  f.  Telecommunications towers and antennas shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant material that effectively reduces the visual obtrusiveness of the tower site from adjacent uses. Existing tree growth and natural land forms on site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. At a minimum a landscaped buffer strip ten feet in width shall be provided around the perimeter of the site. Said requirement shall not apply to alternative tower structures. 
                  g.  Telecommunications towers and antennas shall be constructed to the minimum height necessary to accomplish their required telecommunications purpose. 
                  (6)  Removal requirements. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the governing authority notifying the owner of such abandonment. 
                  (Code 1992, app. A, § 100(6); Ord. No. 98-1, § 1, 5-5-1998; Ord. No. 2003-23A, 11-4-2003) 
                  Sec. 56-51. - District regulations. 
                  Telecommunications towers and antennas shall be specifically permitted as follows: 
                  (1)  Permitted uses. Telecommunication towers and antennas are authorized as permitted uses (without the need for a special use permit) in the following zoning districts: Neighborhood commercial district (C-1), general commercial (C-2), wholesale and light industrial (M-1). The placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or antenna is specifically permitted. In addition to meeting all of the development standards specified for the zoning district within which the tower or antenna is located, all telecommunications towers or antennas shall be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site structure in residential use including accessory structures, such as barns, designed for regular human use, and from any residential (i.e., R-1, R-2, R-2A, R-3, or PUD). 
                  (2)  Uses permitted by special exception. A special use permit shall be required for any telecommunications towers or antenna in the following districts: Single-family residential (R-1), single-family residential (R-2), two-family residential (R-2A), and multifamily residential (R-3). 
                  a.  General. Telecommunications towers and antennas may be erected, installed, constructed, enlarged, moved, or converted only following approval of a special exception subject to the following regulations: 
                  1.  The granting of a special exception for a telecommunications tower or antenna shall be subject to all provisions of this article, except that, notwithstanding the provisions of this article, a special exception for telecommunication towers and antennas shall not expire but shall continue indefinitely or for such time as is established by the governing authority in a particular case. 
                  2.  In granting a special exception, the governing authority may impose conditions to the extent the governing authority concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. 
                  b.  Factors considered in granting special exception. The governing authority shall consider the following facts in determining whether to issue a special exception in addition to those in this article: 
                  1.  Height of the proposed tower; 
                  2.  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries;

                  (1) Discharges in excess of this level are allowed to a level which interferes with the POTW removal efficiency but is surcharged. 
                  (2) Limitation is dependent upon toxicity and biodegradability of constituents exerting demand. 
                  (c)  Categorical pretreatment standards are as follows:

                  ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER 

                  Sec. 60-221. - Findings. 
                  The Centerville Mayor and City Council make the following findings of fact: 
                  (1)  Centerville is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62, to provide stormwater management services throughout Centerville. 
                  (2)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the government of Centerville hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services. 
                  (3)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Centerville is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the Charter of Centerville to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. 
                  (4)  Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within Centerville. 
                  (5)  A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within Centerville and surrounding areas. 
                  (6)  Centerville presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities that have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
                  (7)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the Centerville Water and Wastewater Department thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. 
                  (8)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels of treatment requirements imposed on the city and the city's wastewater treatment facilities and increased water treatment costs. 
                  (9)  Proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing development as well as future development and redevelopment in Centerville. 
                  (10)  The city is required under Federal and State regulations [i.e., the City's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II Georgia Notice of Intent (NOI) and Stormwater Permit, effective December 6, 2012] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature. 
                  (11)  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES permit, along with other city stormwater program activities, will substantially increase the cost of providing stormwater management services above what is currently being spent for water quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood control and other program activities. 
                  (12)  The cost of operating and maintaining the Centerville stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. 
                  (13)  The professional engineering and financing analysis, known as the Stormwater Utility Implementation Report (including amendments) and related documents, dated July 2013 and prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer, which report is incorporated herein by express reference, properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
                  (14)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
                  (15)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (16)  The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways as described in the stormwater utility implementation report. 
                  (17)  The services and benefits rendered, or resulting from provision of stormwater management services, may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long-term demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof. 
                  (18)  A stormwater management program (SWMP) provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described in the stormwater utility implementation report, and the other related documents, which have been prepared for the city by its consultants. 
                  (19)  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges that address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the city council. 
                  (20)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets that reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city's SWMP, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater manager. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property. 
                  (21)  The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. 
                  (22)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

                  Sec. 60-222. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto. 
                  Attached residential property shall mean improved property containing individually owned, attached dwelling units such as duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, townhouses, or other residential structures not listed herein where one or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. Improved property may be classified as an attached residential property despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports and small storage buildings. Improved property may be classified as an attached residential property despite the presence of a commercial use. Attached residential property shall not include improved property containing: structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, hotels, motels, retirement centers, nursing homes and assisted living homes. 
                  Credit means a reduction in the amount of a stormwater user fee charge to the owner of a particular property for the existence and use of privately owned, maintained and operated on-site or off-site stormwater systems or facilities, or continuing provision of services or activities that reduce or mitigate the city's cost of providing stormwater management services for that particular property. 
                  Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the services provided by the city's SWMP and the stormwater utility. These services include, but are not necessarily limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities and activities. 
                  Detached single-family residential property or DSFR means improved property containing one residential structure, which is not attached to another dwelling, and which contains one or more bedrooms, with bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. A detached single-family residential property may include a "stick-built," industrialized, or manufactured home located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Improved property may be classified as a detached single-family residential property even if there is present incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guest houses, servants or caretakers quarters, cottages or barns, or the presence of a commercial use within the residence, as long as such use does not result in additional areas of impervious surfaces. Detached single-family residential properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, manufactured homes located within manufactured home parks where the land is owned by someone other than the owners of the manufactured homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
                  Dwelling unit shall mean a structure, which contains one or more bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen facility. 
                  Equivalent runoff unit (ERU) means the statistical median horizontal impervious surface area of a detached single-family residential property within Centerville as of the date of adoption of this article. The horizontal impervious surface area includes, but is not limited to, all areas covered by structures, roof extensions, patios, porches, driveways and sidewalks. 
                  Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition. 
                  Impervious surface means those areas that prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
                  Improved property means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 500 square feet of impervious surfaces. 
                  Non-single-family residential property or NSFR means improved property containing multiple dwelling unit residential properties, condominiums, apartments, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, tennis courts, swimming pools, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses, water and wastewater treatment plants, and any other form of use not otherwise mentioned which is not a detached single-family residential (DSFR), or attached residential (AR) property, and which has private parking lots and private drives or roads. 
                  Public water influence zone means those areas lying downstream of a culvert, or other stormwater management conveyance system. On the downstream side of the conveyance system, the public water influence zone will extend for a length of six times the diameter (or width) of the culvert from which runoff is being discharged (Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Third Edition, pg. 99), and within the horizontal limits set forth in the aforementioned field manual. For example, if a 48-inch diameter culvert is discharging to a private property, the public water influence zone shall extend 24 feet (six times 48-inches) from the end of the culvert and for the specified width (i.e., typically the width of the creek). The Centerville Stormwater Utility may perform maintenance and/or capital construction activities only within that portion of the public water influence zone that the city has an ownership interest in, or for which a dedicated easement has been granted to, and accepted by the city for such purpose. 
                  Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city. 
                  Stormwater management services means all services provided by the city that relate to the: 
                  (1)  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated portions of the city; 
                  (2)  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities; 
                  (3)  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs; 
                  (4)  Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems and facilities; and 
                  (5)  Compliance with applicable state and federal stormwater management regulations and permit requirements. 
                  Stormwater management services may address the quality of stormwater runoff as well as the quantity thereof. 
                  Stormwater management systems and facilities means those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey, detain, retain, treat or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
                  Stormwater manager means the person appointed by the mayor and council to administer the provisions of this article. 
                  Stormwater user fee charge means the periodic user fee charge imposed pursuant to this article by the Centerville Stormwater Utility for providing stormwater management services. This term shall exclude special charges to the owners of particular properties for services, systems or facilities related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects, on-site stormwater control systems and other stormwater management services provided by Centerville for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered. 
                  Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface, which impedes the infiltration of stormwater runoff or causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of 500 square feet or less of impervious surface. 
                  User is defined as any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management.

                  (a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility to be known as the Centerville Stormwater Utility, which shall be responsible for stormwater management services throughout the incorporated areas of the city, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the city's stormwater management services. 
                  (b)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility enterprise fund in the city budgeting and accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the Centerville SWMP and Stormwater Utility, including, but not limited to, rates, charges, and fees as may be established by the city council from time to time, and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the Centerville Stormwater Utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater utility enterprise fund and shall be used solely for stormwater management services. All expenses and capital investments of the stormwater utility shall be paid from the stormwater utility enterprise fund; provided, however, that other revenues, receipts and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management services as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  (c)  The city shall place responsibility with the stormwater manager for operation, maintenance and regulation of the SWMP and stormwater management services performed, owned and operated or maintained by Centerville, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties, other than road rights-of-way, upon which such stormwater management systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management.

                  Sec. 60-224. - Scope of responsibility for stormwater management systems and facilities. 
                  (a)  The city owns or has rights established by written agreements which allow it to operate, maintain, improve and access those stormwater management systems and facilities which are located: 
                  (1)  Within public road rights-of-way; 
                  (2)  On private property but within easements granted to, and accepted by, Centerville, or are otherwise permitted to be located on such private property by written agreements for rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management system facilities located thereon; 
                  (3)  On private property but within a public water influence zone; 
                  (4)  On land dedicated to, and accepted by, the city solely for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon; or 
                  (5)  On public land which is owned by the city and/or land of another governmental entity upon which the city has agreements providing for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon. 
                  (b)  Operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater management systems and facilities that are located on private or public property not owned by the city, and for which there has been no written agreement granting easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other form of dedication thereof to the city for operation, maintenance, improvement and access of such stormwater management and systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as otherwise provided for by the state and federal laws and regulations. 
                  (c)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the city, its elected officials, officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship. 
                  (d)  If any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city, or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit, negligent issuance of a permit, negligent plan approval, or negligent maintenance of any permitted stormwater management system or facility not expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city for further maintenance in an action seeking the imposition of money damages or equitable remedies against the city, its commissioners, officers, employees or agents.

                  Sec. 60-225. - Stormwater utility customer classes. 
                  (a)  There shall be one stormwater utility service area in Centerville with specified customer classes to reflect variations in services provided to stormwater utility customers and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city stormwater management program and drainage system. The specified customer classes for the Centerville Stormwater Utility are as follows: 
                  (1)  Detached single-family residential (DSFR) customers as defined in section 60-222 of this article. 
                  (2)  Attached residential (AR) customers shall consist of all properties as defined in section 60-222 of this article. 
                  (3)  Non-single-family residential (NSFR) customers shall consist of all properties located in Centerville that are not classified as DSFR, or AR. 
                  (b)  Documentation pertaining to the Centerville Stormwater Utility customer classes shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater manager for public inspection. 
                  (Ord. No. 2016-1 , 3-1-2016) 
                  Sec. 60-226. - Stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (a)  It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service areas shall be equitably derived through methods that have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services. Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, fees for special services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, system development charges and special assessments. 
                  (b)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners that eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities that impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities. 
                  (Ord. No. 2016-1 , 3-1-2016) 
                  Sec. 60-227. - Stormwater user fee charge rates. 
                  (a)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the city council. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the City of Centerville Utilities Office. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, and together with other sources of support available to the Centerville Stormwater Utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  (1)  Detached single-family residential (DSFR) customer class. All DSFR properties shall be charged a flat rate equivalent to one ERU. 
                  (2)  Attached residential (AR) customer class. All AR properties as defined herein shall be charged the rate applicable to one ERU times the number of dwelling units located on the property (ERU total) times an adjustment factor (AF). The adjustment factor (AF) has been determined to be 0.60. For each monthly user fee charge billing, the ERU total figure will be multiplied by the adjustment factor (AF) which adjusts the ERU total to equal the median impervious surface of a statistical comparison of AR properties versus DSFR properties in the city. Therefore, each attached residential dwelling unit will be charged a stormwater user fee of 0.60 ERU per dwelling unit per month. 
                  (3)  Non-single-family residential (NSFR) customer class. All NSFR properties as defined herein shall be billed one ERU for every 3,900 square foot increment, or portion thereof, of impervious surfaces located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs for NSFR properties will be rounded to two decimal places to establish the actual number of ERUs for billing. If a NSFR property has less than 1.00 ERU, then the customer will be billed a minimum of 1.00 ERU. 
                  (b)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be applied to customers as follows: 
                  (1)  The DSFR stormwater user fee flat rate charge shall be $4.25 per month. 
                  (2)  The AR stormwater user fee charge for each ERU, or fractional ERU, shall be $4.25 per ERU (3,900 square feet) per month. 
                  (3)  The NSFR stormwater user charge for each ERU, or fractional ERU, shall be $4.25 per ERU (3,900 square feet) per month.

                  Sec. 60-228. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions. 
                  Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in the incorporated area of Centerville shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. 
                  Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows: 
                  (1)  Parcels which contain 500 square feet, or less, of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (2)  Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (3)  Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way and road systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other improved property used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. All other state, federal, and county properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties. 
                  (4)  Centerville (city owned) public streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in consideration for the city allowing the utility to use the city's existing street, curbs, gutters, drainage ways and ditches, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural and manmade within and owned by the city which controls and diverts surface water for the purposes of collecting, diverting, transporting and controlling surface and stormwaters. However, other improved property used for city purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. Additionally, impervious surfaces installed and maintained for the purposes of access to private or public parcels (i.e., driveways) on public rights-of-way shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (5)  Any property whereby 100 percent of the stormwater runoff is contained or infiltrated on the property and no stormwater runoff is discharged, via overland flow or manmade conveyance to adjacent properties or rights-of-way for all storm events up to and including the 100-year, 24-hour storm event.

                  Sec. 60-229. - Stormwater user fee charge credits. 
                  (a)  The stormwater manager shall grant credits or adjustments based on the technical and procedural criteria set forth in the Stormwater Utility Non-Single-Family Residential Technical Credit Manual or the Stormwater Utility Residential Technical Credit Manual. Copies of the Technical Credit Manuals will be maintained by and available from the stormwater manager. 
                  (1)  A stormwater user fee charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements, standards and criteria contained in the Technical Credit Manuals. The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the Technical Credit Manuals. 
                  (2)  Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the Technical Credit Manuals and/or upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The stormwater manager may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the Technical Credit Manuals or this article. 
                  (3)  In order to obtain a credit, the property owner must make application to the city on forms provided by the stormwater manager for such purpose, and in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Technical Credit Manuals. 
                  (4)  Property owners may apply for any credits and/or adjustments in accordance with the Technical Credit Manuals. 
                  (5)  The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, and be in the format established by the stormwater manager. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for consideration and processing. 
                  (b)  When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the stormwater manager, he shall have 30 days from the date the complete application is accepted to either grant the credit in whole, grant the credit in part, or deny the credit. Credits applied for by the property owner and granted in whole or in part, shall apply to all stormwater user fee charges in accordance with the terms defined in the Technical Credit Manuals.

                  Sec. 60-230. - Enforcement methods and inspections. 
                  (a)  All property owners of improved property within the incorporated areas of Centerville shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the Centerville Municipal Court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the penalties set forth in the Centerville Code of Ordinances. 
                  (b)  Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater manager, the city may elect to sue in the Centerville Municipal Court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the Centerville Municipal Court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Centerville Municipal Court. 
                  (c)  The city shall have the right for its designated officers and employees to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law. Such inspections shall generally be limited to the following purposes: 
                  (1)  Inspecting or conducting engineering analyses on existing stormwater management systems and facilities located on-site; or 
                  (2)  Determining that stormwater management systems and facilities need to be constructed. 
                  (Ord. No. 2016-1 , 3-1-2016) 
                  Sec. 60-231. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments. 
                  Failure to receive a stormwater utility bill is not justification for nonpayment. The property owner, as identified from public land records of Houston County, shall be ultimately obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property. 
                  (1)  Billing. 
                  a.  Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue July 1, 2016, and shall be billed prospectively. The initial billing cycle will be July 1, 2016. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater user fee charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due. 
                  b.  . The stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected as an additional line item on the city's utilities bills or other means deemed most effective and efficient by the city council. 
                  1.  Wherein a property receives multiple utilities (for example in the case of a shopping center will multiple tenants), a single bill shall be sent to property owner. 
                  c.  Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be monthly or as specified by the city council. 
                  d.  Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each developed property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments. 
                  e.  If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of improved property, the Centerville Stormwater Utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period. 
                  (2)  Delinquencies and collection. 
                  a.  Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner and/or the property. 
                  b.  A late charge shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility user fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner. 
                  1.  If a stormwater utility fee is billed to a tenant of a property and the tenant fails to pay the fee, then property owner shall become liable for all charges. However, the city shall not be entitled to late fees accrued by the tenant. 
                  (3)  Adjustments. 
                  a.  The stormwater manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge. 
                  1.  If a customer believes their stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the stormwater manager and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. 
                  2.  Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information to the stormwater manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request. 
                  3.  Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater manager, the stormwater manager shall have 30 calendar days within which to render a written decision. Concurrent payment of any charges allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to this request for review. 
                  4.  In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater utility user fee charge for the property is correct. 
                  5.  The stormwater manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
                  6.  If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater bill. However, the credit shall not exceed an amount exceeding the amount paid within the past one year and shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period. 
                  7.  If the result of an adjustment is that an increase in fees is warranted (due to under-billing), the city shall not be entitled to back charges, interest or any delinquency charges as a result of the error.

                  Sec. 60-232. - Appeals, hearings. 
                  (a)  Appeals. An appeal to the director of operations and city attorney may be taken by any property owner or customer aggrieved by any decision of the stormwater manager. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days of the decision of the stormwater manager by filing with the utilities office manager a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the utilities office manager shall forthwith transmit to the director of operations and city attorney documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken. 
                  (b)  Hearing. The director of operations and city attorney shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall indicate the place, date and time of the hearing. The director of operations and city attorney shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the stormwater manager after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the stormwater manager is reversed in whole or in part, resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal. 
                  (c)  The decision of the director of operations and city attorney shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the director of operations and city attorney may appeal that decision to the Superior Court of Houston County by writ of certiorari.

                  The purpose of this section is to prevent unduly high grass and weeds from detracting from the appearance of a neighborhood, inviting infestation of such area by snakes and rodents and providing other health hazards to the area. 
                  Sec. 62-20. - Height regulations. 
                  It shall be unlawful for the owner, tenant, lessee or resident of any property within the city to permit grass or weeds to grow to a height in excess of 12 inches upon property on which he resides or has an interest. 
                  Sec. 62-21. - Notice of violation. 
                  Upon notification by the city that certain property is in violation of this section, the owner, tenant, lessee or resident of such property shall have ten days in which to have the grass and weeds cut below the 12-inch height. Notification may consist of an agent of the city posting a sign on the property, attaching a written notice to the door of any building on the property or mailing a written notice by first class mail to the owner or resident of the property at the address listed for the respective property in the real estate property tax records of the city. 
                  Sec. 62-22. - Failure of owner to abate; abatement by city; abatement costs. 
                  If the grass and weeds have not been cut below the 12-inch height by the end of ten days from the date of the notice to cut the grass and weeds, a lawn care contractor representative for the city will cut the grass and weeds and the city will assess a charge to the owner, tenant, lessee or resident for the work that is done by the lawn care contractor. The assessment charge will be the same charge as the charge submitted to the city by the respective lawn care contractor. 
                  Sec. 62-23. - Payment of abatement costs; failure to pay. 
                  Upon completion of the work done by the contractor for the city, the owner, tenant, lessee or resident will have 15 days in which to make payment of the cost of the work. If the assessment cost is not paid within the 15-day time period, a lien will be taken out against the respective property and the city will take actions it deems appropriate to collect the debt from the owner, tenant, lessee or resident of the property.

                  (1)  Unless otherwise indicated, the district boundaries are indicated as approximately following property lines, land lot lines, centerlines of streets, highways, alleys or railroads, shorelines of streams, reservoirs, or other bodies of water, or civil boundaries, and they shall be construed to follow such lines. 
                  (2)  Where district boundaries are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways, or railroads, or right-of-way of the same, or the centerlines of streams, reservoirs, or other bodies of water, or said lines extended, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance there from as indicated on the official zoning maps. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the official zoning maps. 
                  (3)  Where a district boundary line as appearing on the official zoning maps divides a lot which is single ownership at the time of this enactment, the use classification of a larger portion may be extended to the remainder by the council without recourse to amendment procedure. 
                  (4)  Where a public road, street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to the property to which it is reverted shall apply to such vacated or abandoned road, street or alley. 
                  (5)  In case the exact location of a boundary cannot be determined by the methods set forth in this section, the council shall, upon application, determine the location of the boundary.

                  Sec. 66-84. - Nonconforming buildings and uses. 
                  (a)  It is the intent of this chapter to recognize that the elimination of existing buildings and structures or uses that are not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter is as much a subject of health, safety and general welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this chapter. It is also the intent of this chapter to administer the elimination of nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights. 
                  (b)  Therefore, any structure or use of land existing at the time of the enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, and amendments thereto, but not in conformity with its use regulations and provisions, may be continued subject to the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Unsafe structures. Any structure or portion thereof declared unsafe by the zoning enforcement officer may be restored to a safe condition, provided the requirements in this section are met. 
                  (2)  Alterations. Any change in a nonconforming building, use, or building site or yard area is subject to the following: 
                  a.  No nonconforming building can be structurally altered, except as follows: 
                  1.  Repairs on or the installation of plumbing fixtures as required by law; 
                  2.  The changing of interior partitions; and 
                  3.  Interior remodeling. 
                  b.  No nonconforming building or lands, except those residential dwellings needing repairs on or installation of plumbing fixtures as required by law, can be substantially added to, moved, or extended in any manner unless such building or land is changed so as to conform with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  c.  Whenever an existing residential dwelling must make repairs on or installation of plumbing fixtures which will force the location of the future addition of the dwelling nearer the lot line than the requirements set forth in this chapter, the addition to the dwelling shall be allowed to extend to the existing building line but no nearer the property line than any existing portion of the dwelling. 
                  d.  Should a nonconforming building be moved, all nonconforming yard areas shall be eliminated. 
                  (3)  Extension. A nonconforming use of land shall be restricted to the lot occupied by such use as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. A nonconforming use of a building or buildings shall not be extended to include either additional buildings or land after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
                  (4)  Restoration of damaged buildings. A nonconforming building, structure or improvement which is hereafter damaged or destroyed to an extent exceeding 50 percent of the reasonable estimated replacement cost of the structure, building or improvement may not be reconstructed or restored to the same nonconforming use except upon approval of the board of zoning appeals. 
                  (5)  Change in use. A nonconforming use which is changed to a conforming use shall not be permitted to revert to the original or a less restrictive use. 
                  (6)  Discontinuance. A nonconforming use which became such as a result of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or by virtue of the annexation of the said property into the city and which has been discontinued for a continuous period of two years shall not be reestablished and any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (Code 1992, app. A, § 61) 
                  Sec. 66-85. - Off-street automobile parking. 
                  Off-street automobile storage of parking space shall be provided on every lot on which any permitted or conditional use is established in accordance with this chapter. 
                  (1)  General requirements. For the purpose of this chapter the following general requirements are specified: 
                  a.  The term "off-street parking space" means a space at least nine feet wide and 20 feet in length with a minimum net area of 180 square feet, excluding area for egress and ingress and maneuverability of vehicles. 
                  b.  If an off-street parking space cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, the board of zoning appeals may permit such space to be provided on other off-street property, provided such space lies within 600 feet of the property line of such principal use. Such vehicle parking space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner. 
                  c.  The required number of parking spaces for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot, but the required space assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use at the same time, except that portion of the parking space required for existing church whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which will be closed at nights or on Sundays. 
                  d.  Area reserved for off-street parking in accordance with the requirements of this chapter shall not be reduced in area or changed to any other use unless the permitted use which it serves is discontinued or modified, except where equivalent parking space is provided to the satisfaction of the board of zoning appeals. 
                  e.  Off-street parking existing at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived in connection with the operation of an existing building or use shall not be reduced to an amount less than hereinafter required for a similar new building or use. 
                  (2)  Parking space requirements for all districts. Off-street automobile storage or parking space shall be provided with vehicular access to a street or alley, and shall be equal in or to at least the minimum requirements for the specific land use set forth. 

                   
                  (3)  Site requirements. All off-street parking shall be laid out, constructed, in accordance with the following requirements, except in residential areas. The plans shall indicate that: 
                  a.  All such parking areas shall be hard surfaces surfaced with concrete or plant bituminous material and shall be maintained in a dustproof condition and that a good stand of grass be maintained on the remainder of the lot. 
                  b.  Lighting facilities shall be so arranged that light is reflected away from adjacent properties. 
                  c.  The parking lot shall be adequately drained. 
                  d.  Along those lot lines of the parking area which abut residential districts, a dense planting of trees and shrubs shall be established on a strip of land not less than eight feet in width adjacent to the districts and provided that such planting be not less than six feet in height and a substantial bumper rail of wood, metal or concrete shall be installed on the inside of the planting strip. 
                  e.  A raised curb of at least six inches shall be erected along all of the property lines, except for driveway openings, and those lot lines abutting residential districts where the requirements in subsection (3)d of this section shall prevail. 
                  f.  No sign, whether permanent or temporary, shall be placed within the public right-of-way. Signs and planting strips shall be arranged so that they do not obstruct visibility for drivers or pedestrians.

                  (1)  Size of off-street loading spaces. Each off-street loading space shall have minimum dimensions of 14 feet in height, 12 feet in width, and 55 feet in length. However, upon sufficient demonstration that a particular loading space will be used exclusively by shorter trucks, the board of zoning appeals may reduce the minimum length accordingly to as little as 35 feet. 
                  (2)  Connection to street or alley. Each required off-street loading space shall have direct access to a street or alley or have a driveway which offers satisfactory ingress and egress for trucks. 
                  (3)  Floor area over 10,000 square feet. There shall be provided for each hospital, institution, hotel, commercial or industrial building or similar use requiring the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise, and having a floor area of more than 10,000 square feet, at least one off-street loading space for each 10,000 square feet of floor space or fraction thereof. Such space shall be so located as not to hinder the free movement of pedestrians and vehicles over a sidewalk, street or alley. 
                  (4)  Floor area less than 10,000 square feet. There shall be provided for each commercial or industrial building requiring the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise and having a floor area of less than 10,000 square feet, sufficient off-street loading space (not necessarily a full space if shared by an adjacent establishment) so located as not to hinder the free movement of pedestrians and vehicles over a sidewalk, street or alley. 
                  (5)  Bus and trucking terminals. There shall be provided sufficient space to accommodate the maximum number of buses or trucks to be stored or to be loaded at the terminal at any one time. 
                  (6)  Location of off-street loading spaces. All required off-street loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building which they are intended to serve, or on an adjacent lot when shared with the use occupying said adjacent lot. 
                  (7)  Permanent reservation. Area reserved for off-street loading in accordance with the requirements of this chapter shall not be reduced in area or changed to any other use unless the permitted use which is served is discontinued or modified, except where equivalent loading space is provided and approved by the board of zoning appeals.

                  (8)  Marginal access streets or frontage roads. Marginal access streets or frontage roads are minor streets which are parallel and adjacent to freeways, expressways, or arterial streets and highways; and which provide access to abutting properties and protection from through traffic.

This requirement shall become effective for all new operations in commercial or industrial districts commencing on May 1, 1994. Any operation now being conducted in a commercial or industrial district outside a building is exempt from the fence requirement until such time as the operation ceases to exist. At that time, any new operation at the same location will be required to have a fence. 
                  (b)  Outdoor lighting of all types shall be directed so as to reflect away from all residential dwellings, and shall be so situated as not to reflect directly into any public rights-of-way.

                  Sec. 66-178. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Approach-departure surface means the symmetrical surface about the Robins Air Force Base runway centerline extended, begins as in inclined plane (glide angle) 200 feet beyond each end of the primary surface to the centerline elevation of the runway end, and extends for 50,000 feet. The slope of the approach-departure clearance surface is 50:1 (one foot change in elevation for each 50 feet in distance from the starting point) along the extended runway (glide angle) centerline until it reaches an elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. It then continues horizontally at this elevation to a point at 50,000 feet from the start of the glide angle. The width of this surface at the runway end is 2,000 feet. It then flares uniformly, with an end width of 16,000 feet at a distance 50,000 feet from both starting points. 
                  Conical surface means the inclined surface extending outward and upward from the outer periphery of the inner horizontal surface for a horizontal distance of 7,000 feet. The slope of the conical surface is 20:1 (one foot change in elevation for each 20 feet in distance from the starting point) with an inner elevation of 150 feet above the established airfield elevation and an outer elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. 
                  Clear zone surface means the surface limits of the obstruction clearance requirements in the vicinity contiguous to the end of the primary surface. The length and width for a single runway of a clear zone surface is 3,000 feet by 3,000 feet. 
                  Established airfield elevation means the altitude, measured in feet above mean sea level (MSL), of the Robins Air Force Base main runway surface. This elevation is hereby declared to be 295 feet MSL. 
                  Height means the true highest altitude of a structure or natural feature, including trees, protruding rocks or natural ground surface, as measured in feet above mean sea level. 
                  Inner horizontal surface means the surface plane, oval in shape, that extends 7,500 feet from Robins Air Force Base airfield runway centerline at a height of 150 feet above the established airfield elevation. 
                  Obstruction means any structure or natural feature, including trees, protruding rocks or natural ground surface, which exceeds the height limitation of as defined by the primary surface, clear zone surface, approach-departure clearance surfaces, inner horizontal surface, conical surface, outer horizontal surface or transitional surfaces established for Robins Air Force Base. 
                  Outer horizontal surface means the horizontal surface plane that begins at the outer edge of the conical surface and extends for 30,000 feet at a height of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. 
                  Primary surface means the surface limits of the obstruction clearance requirements in the immediate vicinity of the landing area. The primary surface comprises surfaces of the runway, runway shoulders, and lateral safety zones and extends 200 feet beyond the runway end. The width of the primary surface for the Robins Air Force Base runway is 2,000 feet or 1,000 feet on each side of the runway centerline. 
                  Structure means any stationary or mobile object constructed or installed by man, including, without limitation, buildings, towers, cranes, smoke stacks, earth formations and overhead transmission lines. 
                  Transitional surfaces means the surfaces that connect the primary surfaces, clear zone surfaces and approach-departure clearance to the outer horizontal surface, conical surface and other horizontal or transitional surfaces. The slope of the transitional surface is 7:1 (one foot in elevation for each seven feet in distance from the starting point) outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline extended.
