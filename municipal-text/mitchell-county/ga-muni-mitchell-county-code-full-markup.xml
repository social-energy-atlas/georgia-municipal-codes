PREFACE

         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Mitchell County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Index 
                  The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments

Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

               Sec. 101. - Continued in existence. 
               (a)  The Board of Commissioners of Mitchell County which existed immediately prior to the effective date of this Act, is continued in existence but on and after the effective date of this Act, shall be constituted as provided in this Act. The Board of Commissioners of Mitchell County so continued and constituted, sometimes referred to in this Act as the "board," shall continue to have the powers, duties, rights, obligations, and liabilities of that board as existed immediately prior to the effective date of this Act. 
               (b)  Those members of the Board of Commissioners of Mitchell County who are serving as such immediately prior to the effective date of this Act, and any person selected to fill a vacancy in any such office shall continue to serve as such members until the regular expiration of their respective terms of office and upon the election and qualification of their respective successors. On and after the effective date of this Act, the Board of Commissioners of Mitchell County shall consist of five members all of whom shall be elected from commissioner districts described in subsection (c) of this section. 
               (c)  For purposes of electing members of the board of commissioners, Mitchell County is divided into five commissioner districts. One member of the board shall be elected from each such district. The five commissioner districts shall be and correspond to those five numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this Act and further identified as Plan Name: MITCHCCPIR Plan Type: Local User: staff Administrator: Mitchell Co. 
               (d)  When used in such attachment, the terms "Tract" and "BG" (Block Group) shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a Tract description which are underneath a "BG" heading shall mean and describe individual Blocks within a Block Group as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Mitchell County which is not included in any such district described in that attachment shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Mitchell County which is described in that attachment as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Except as otherwise provided in the description of any commissioner district, whenever the description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. 
               (e)  No person shall be a member of the board if that person is ineligible for such office pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 45-2-1 or any other general law applicable to that office. 
               (f)  In order to be elected as a member of the board from a commissioner district, a person must receive the number of votes cast as required by general law for that office in that district only. Only electors who are residents of that commissioner district may vote for a member of the board for that district. At the time of qualifying for election as a member of the board from a commissioner district, each candidate for such office shall specify the commissioner district for which that person is a candidate. A person elected or appointed as a member of the board from a commissioner district must continue to reside in that district during that person's term of office or that office shall become vacant. 
               Sec. 102. - Election of members. 
               (a)  The first members of the reconstituted Board of Commissioners of Mitchell County from Commissioner Districts 1 and 3 shall be elected at the general election on the Tuesday next following the first Monday in November 2002. Those members of the board elected thereto from Commissioner Districts 1 and 3 in 2002 shall take office the first day of January immediately following that election and shall serve for initial terms of office which expire December 31, 2006, and upon the election and qualification of their respective successors. The first members of the reconstituted Board of Commissioners of Mitchell County from Commissioner Districts 2, 4, and 5 shall be elected at the general election on the Tuesday next following the first Monday in November, 2004. Those members of the board elected thereto from Commissioner Districts 2, 4, and 5 in 2004 shall take office the first day of January immediately following that election and shall serve for initial terms of office which expire December 31, 2008, and upon the election and qualification of their respective successors. Those and all future successors to members of the board whose terms of office are to expire shall be elected at the time of the state-wide general election immediately preceding the expiration of such terms, shall take office the first day of January immediately following that election, and shall serve for terms of office of four years each. Members of the board shall serve for the terms of office specified therefor in this subsection and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. 
               (b)  All members of the board who are elected thereto shall be nominated and elected in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title 21 of the O.C.G.A., the "Georgia Election Code." 
               (c)  Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, as they exist immediately prior to the effective date of this Act, shall continue to be designated as Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, but as newly described under this Act, and on and after the effective date of this Act, such members of the board serving from those former commissioner districts shall be deemed to be serving from and representing their respective districts as newly described under this Act. 
               (d)  Any vacancy in office upon the board which occurs for any reason shall be filled pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-5-21.

Supp. Chapter 87-8, as if said obligations had been originally authorized to be issued thereunder; provided, however, that any property, real or personal, of the Authority may be pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered as security for any lawful debt of the Authority.

The ad valorem tax millage rate limitation applicable to the Mitchell County School District under this Section VII of the Constitution and any ad valorem tax millage rate limitation now or hereafter applicable to the Pelham Independent School District shall be reduced for every taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1984, by a millage rate which, if levied against property taxable for educational purposes within each school district, would produce an amount of revenue equal to the proceeds of the local sales and use tax received by that school district in the immediately preceding taxable year. Said school districts shall also comply with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 48-8-91 as if they were counties or municipalities within the meaning of that Code section and as if the tax provided for herein were levied pursuant to Article 2, Chapter 8, Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. No referendum shall be required for the imposition of this tax. Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit Mitchell County and those municipalities located therein from imposing as an additional tax that joint county and municipality sales and use tax authorized by Article 2, Chapter 8, Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. The two school districts are authorized to contract or otherwise provide for the collection and administration of the tax required to be imposed under this paragraph. The net proceeds of the tax shall be distributed between the Mitchell County School District and the Pelham Independent School District according to the ratio the population in each school district bears to the total population of Mitchell County or upon such other formula for distribution as may be determined by local law. The tax authorized by this paragraph may be imposed, levied, and collected as provided herein without further action by the General Assembly, but the General Assembly shall be authorized by local law to control the subject matter of this paragraph and to further define and implement its provisions. This authority may be exercised by the General Assembly notwithstanding any general law heretofore or hereafter enacted dealing with the subject matter of this paragraph and any local law adopted pursuant to the authority of this paragraph shall control that subject matter notwithstanding the provisions of any conflicting general law.

                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-10. - Altering Code.

                  DIVISION 3. - PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE 

                  Sec. 2-71. - Main motion. 
                  In order for the board to take any official action on any subject, a commissioner must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chair until another commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion. A commissioner may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the board has voted on that motion. 
                  (Ord. No. 2001-010, § 1-01, 6-12-2001) 
                  Sec. 2-72. - Debate. 
                  After the main motion is recognized by the chair, the board shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chairman in a manner that is fair to all members of the board. Commissioners can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chairman. During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce subsidiary motions as stated in section 2-75 that propose that the board take a particular action on a motion. There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. Commissioners may also introduce privileged motions as stated in section 2-76. Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions. 
                  (Ord. No. 2001-010, § 1-02, 6-12-2001) 
                  Sec. 2-73. - Voting procedure. 
                  Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: If debate has been completed and no other commissioner wishes to speak, the chair can call for the vote. If there are no objections then the chair can proceed with the vote. If the chairman calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the board may move to vote immediately (move the previous question). If this motion is seconded and approved by a two-third votes, debate will stop. The chairman will then read the proposed motion to the board and ask for the votes of the commissioners. 
                  (2)  Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chair. The chairman shall read the proposed motion to the board and then call for the vote. 
                  (Ord. No. 2001-010, § 1-03, 6-12-2001) 
                  Sec. 2-74. - Ranking of motions. 
                  Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the board returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the top of the following list take precedence over motions at the bottom of the list: 

                   
                  (Ord. No. 2001-010, § 1-04, 6-12-2001) 
                  Sec. 2-75. - Subsidiary motions. 
                  During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow a board to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions, amend, limit debate and vote immediately, also can apply to other subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)  Postpone indefinitely. If a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered by the board, that commissioner may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled for the duration of the meeting. A motion to postpone indefinitely can be debated but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)  Amend. If a commissioner believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. Debate is limited to the proposed amendment. A majority vote is required for the board to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted then the board shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)  Refer to a committee (commit). If a commissioner believes that further information is needed before the board can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to commit should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the board. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (4)  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a commissioner believes that the main motion should be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairman will bring the original motion back to the board for consideration at the specified time which may be at the same meeting, at a subsequent meeting, or upon the occurrence of a specified time which may be at the same meeting, at a subsequent meeting, or upon the occurrence of a specified event. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)  Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the commissioner who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a two-thirds vote is required. 
                  (6)  Vote immediately (previous question). If a commissioner believes debate on a motion should end and that the motion being considered should be voted on, the commissioner can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable and a vote of two-thirds of the board is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (7)  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the same meeting. The main motion can be brought back for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the board during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. No. 2001-010, § 1-05, 6-12-2001) 
                  Sec. 2-76. - Privileged motions. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
                  (1)  Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chair concerning the rights of a commissioner or of the board as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chair is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)  Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time when business is still pending. It is a temporary intermission of the proceedings. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)  Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a commissioner must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. No. 2001-010, § 1-06, 6-12-2001) 
                  Sec. 2-77. - Incidental motion. 
                  Incidental motions allow commissioners to exert their rights as a member of the board. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)  Appeal. If a commissioner disagrees with a ruling that is made by the chair, that commissioner may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the board. The chair has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The board may then debate the appeal. The board shall decide by majority vote if the chair's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)  Parliamentary inquiry. If a commissioner has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chair to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the board. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)  Point of order (question of order). If a commissioner believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chair can make a ruling on the question or can allow the board to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)  Point of information (request for information). If a commissioner has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chair and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (Ord. No. 2001-010, § 1-07, 6-12-2001) 
                  Sec. 2-78. - Supplementary main motions. 
                  Three motions allow the board to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the board. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified. 
                  (1)  Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the board to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the board to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any commissioner can make a motion to reconsider and any commissioner may second the motions. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the board is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the board will return to debate and revote the original motion. 
                  (2)  Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the board overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any commissioner. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the commissioner seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, then the board shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (3)  Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the board to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

                  ARTICLE III. - PLUMBING INSPECTIONS 

                  Sec. 18-61. - Findings. 
                  (a)  The general assembly of the state enacted legislation during the 1996 session of the legislature (1996 Ga. Laws, page 1632) specifying, among other things, that master plumbers and utility contractors may self-inspect their own installation of water and sewer lines under conditions specified in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-26(d). 
                  (b)  The role of the county inspections office is to ensure that work undertaken by plumbers, utility contractors as well as construction contractors, subcontractors and others in the building trades is done in accordance with properly enacted county building and/or construction codes. 
                  (c)  Water and sewer lines are particularly susceptible to problems resulting from improper installation since they are installed underground and out-of-view once covered over by the plumber or utility contractor. 
                  (d)  Self-inspection of installations of water and sewer lines is inherently suspect as a conflict of interest. 
                  (e)  The general assembly, while authorizing self-inspection, also recognized that self-inspection may not be in the best interest of any county or the citizens of any county by providing in section 3 of 1996 Ga. Laws, page 1632 that any county may exempt itself from the self-inspection provisions of 1996 Ga. Laws, page 1632 by adoption or enactment of a proper resolution or ordinance. 
                  (f)  In lieu of the self-inspection procedure specified in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-26(d), a county may establish other alternative procedures to allow for self-inspection or independent third-party inspection under conditions more favorable to and protective of the public. 
                  (Ord. of 5-14-1996) 
                  Sec. 18-62. - Exemption.

                  (2)  Such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare; and 
                  (3)  Such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations.

                  (b)  Where this section requires compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in section 30-33(b) and (c), issuing authorities shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements as if a permit had been issued and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders. 
                  (Ord. No. 2001-014, § III, 9-11-2001) 
                  Sec. 30-33. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not excluded by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMP's. 
                  (1)  Best management practices, as set forth in this subsection and subsection (c) of this section, shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)  Prevention of erosion, sedimentation. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (b)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; however, any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; however, small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; however, any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed. 
                  (d)  Stricter requirements authorized. Nothing contained in this article shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  Presumptions. The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 30-34. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance (appendix A), stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance (chapter 66), flood damage prevention ordinance (chapter 38), this article, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority. However, the property owner is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county without first obtaining a permit from the county building and zoning department to perform such activity. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the county building and zoning department and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. These plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 30-33(b) and (c). Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. 
                  (3)  A fee, in the amount of $10.00 shall be charged for each acre with a maximum fee of $150.00 per project area. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority.

                  Sec. 30-35. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The county building and zoning department will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation if, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The county building and zoning department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
                  (c)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials; nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (d)  The district or the commission or both shall periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a).

                  (d)  Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)  Except as provided in subsection (d)(2) of this section, any person who violates any provisions of this article, the rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose a penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation. 
                  (2)  The following penalties shall apply to land disturbing activities performed in violation of any provision of this article, any rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article: 
                  a.  There shall be a minimum penalty of $250.00 per day for each violation involving the construction of a single-family dwelling by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy; and 
                  b.  There shall be a minimum penalty of $1,000.00 per day for each violation involving land disturbing activities other than as provided in subsection (d)(2)a. of this section.

The market value of the building should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, which have been preidentified by the building official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met and no reasonable alternative exists. The development must be protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances are as follows: 
                  (1)  Variances shall only be issued when there is a: 
                  a.  Finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (i)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (j)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (k)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (l)  Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this article, the board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  (4)  In elevated buildings, all new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the elevated building's lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls, shall be designed to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall also be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with the automatic equalization requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area. 
                  c.  The interior portion of the enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.

This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this article shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. of 5-13-1997, art. 4, § A) 
                  Sec. 38-92. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data are available, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements. New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of section 38-91(4). 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any nonresidential structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 38-62(6). 
                  (3)  Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on individual lots or parcels, in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on site must: 
                  1.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. 
                  2.  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a. and (3)c. of this section. 
                  A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Within areas of special flood hazard, established in section 38-38, a designated floodway may exist. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. A floodway must remain free of new encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of a base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Floodway encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. An encroachment may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a. of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
                  (Ord. of 5-13-1997, art. 4, § B) 
                  Sec. 38-93. - Standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard, established in section 38-38, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 38-38, then the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this division. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including the basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of section 38-91(4). The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (Ord. of 5-13-1997, art. 4, § C) 
                  Sec. 38-94. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard, established in section 38-38, may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one foot to three feet above the ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including the basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of section 38-91(4). The floodplain administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above the highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 38-64. 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  (Ord. of 5-13-1997, art. 4, § D) 
                  Sec. 38-95. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
                  The standards for subdivision proposals are as follows: 
                  (1)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (2)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  (3)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
                  (4)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less.

                  Sec. 54-201. - Process for resolving. 
                  The following process for resolving land use disputes shall be implemented: 
                  (1)  Prior to initiating any formal annexation activities, the municipality will notify the county of a proposed annexation and provide information on location of property, size of area, and proposed land use or zoning classification(s) (if applicable) of the property. Within 30 days following receipt of this information, the county will forward to the city a statement either: 
                  a.  Indicating that the county has no objection to the proposed land use for the property; or 
                  b.  Describing its bona fide objection(s) to the city's proposed land use classification, providing supporting evidence, and listing any possible stipulations or conditions that would alleviate the county's objection(s). 
                  (2)  If the county has no objection to the city's proposed land use or zoning classification, the city is free to proceed with the annexation. If the county fails to respond to the city's notice in writing within the deadline, the city is free to proceed with the annexation and the county loses its right to invoke the dispute resolution process, or object to land use changes after the annexation. 
                  (3)  If the county notifies the city that it has a bona fide land use classification objection(s), the city will respond to the county in writing within 30 days of receiving the county's objection(s) by either: 
                  a.  Agreeing to implement the county's stipulations and conditions and thereby resolve the county's objection(s). 
                  b.  Agreeing with the county and stopping action on the proposed annexation. 
                  c.  Disagreeing that the county's objection(s) are bona fide, the city will initiate a joint meeting of the respective governments to resolve the issue(s). 
                  (4)  If the city initiates mediation, the city and county will agree on a mediator, mediation schedule and determine participants in the mediation. The city and county agree to share equally any costs associated with the mediation. 
                  (5)  An annexation proposal shall not be effective until any bona fide land use classification objections raised by the county are resolved pursuant to this section. 
                  (6)  The final resolution of any recommendation of a land use classification will be accorded to the board of commissioners considering the annexation. In cases of land use disputes not related to annexation proposals, the final resolution of a land use dispute will be accorded to the jurisdiction in which the subject property is located. Notwithstanding, a government may seek declaratory judgment in a court of proper jurisdiction pursuant to a land use decision.

                  ARTICLE III. - MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS 

                  Sec. 66-91. - Predevelopment review. 
                  Prior to the filing of an application for preliminary plat approval, the developer, the engineer, or agent is encouraged to consult with the county building inspector, health department, public works director and other appropriate county departments as well as the Flint River District of the Natural Resource Conservation Service and the state department of transportation should the property require ingress and egress from a state highway for the purpose of facilitating the review process. 
                  (1)  Sketch plan. It is also recommended that a sketch plan of the proposed development be submitted by the subdivider for review at this time. The sketch plan should contain the following official's data which may be obtained from base maps available at the county building/administration office, the county tax assessor's office, natural resource conservation service office, or the Southwest Georgia Regional Development Center: 
                  a.  Type of development (i.e., residential, manufactured home, or commercial). 
                  b.  Approximate tract boundaries and total acreage. 
                  c.  Approximate location with respect to land lot lines. 
                  d.  Streets on and adjacent to the tract. 
                  e.  Proposed general street layout. 
                  f.  Significant topographic, physical and historic features.

                  i.  Location of any existing wells if applicable. 
                  (2)  Sketch plan review. As far as may be practicable on the basis of a sketch, the planning commission or designated staff will, without prejudice to the county, advise the subdivider within 20 working days, of the extent to which the proposed subdivision conforms to the standards of this article and other applicable ordinances or statutes, and will advise what additional documents, possible plan modifications, etc., must be submitted and what review procedures must be undergone in order to obtain final plat approval. 
                  (3)  Soil and sedimentation review process. The applicant is encouraged to meet with the Soil Conservation Service Office (SCS), Flint River District with a rough draft or sketch plan of the proposed subdivision prior to submitting an application and preliminary plat. Although the step is not a requirement, it is helpful to aid these officials in advising the developer if a soil and sedimentation control plan is necessary. If a proposed new subdivision will have new roads or drainage improvements or entails a significant amount of land disturbing activity entailing greater than 1.1 acres, the developer must submit a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan prior to plat approval. Five copies of the soil erosion and sedimentation plan as well as a land disturbing permit application will need to be delivered to the county building department to be dispensed to the health official, road superintendent, the natural resource and conservation service (formerly the soil conservation service) and department of natural resources for review. The review process may take up to 45 days from the date the plan is submitted.

Administrative minor subdivisions need only be reviewed and approved by the building inspector. Nonadministrative minor subdivisions must be reviewed and approved by the planning commission. Such review, whether by the planning commission, in the case of a nonadministrative minor subdivision, or by the building inspector alone, in the case of an administrative subdivision, shall require the filing of an application and final plat to satisfy this article. 
                  (1)  Filing. The developer shall file an application for final plat approval with the Building Inspector and the County Health Specialist of the Mitchell County Health Department.

The building inspector and the county health specialist shall conduct and complete their respective reviews within ten working days of the building inspector's receipt of the application. In any 12-month period, only one application for an administrative minor subdivision per subdivider, applicant, landowner, or developer may be approved concerning contiguous lots or tracts of land. If the building inspector approves the application and the plat and if the county health specialist approves or certifies the proposed minor subdivision, then each shall sign the final plat as provided in section 66-133, and the building inspector shall notify the applicant of the plat's approval. If the building inspector disapproves the application or the plat or if the county health specialist fails to approve the proposed minor subdivision, then the building inspector shall notify the applicant in writing of the plat's disapproval and the reasons for such disapproval. In the event of disapproval, the applicant may, upon written petition made within ten days of the date of the written notice of disapproval, seek review of the application and plat by the planning commission. 
                  b.  Nonadministrative minor subdivisions. In addition to review by the county health specialist as provided in subsection (3)a. of this section, applications and final plats for nonadministrative subdivisions shall come before the planning commission for approval or denial at the next regular meeting of the planning commission held at least 15 days after the filing of the application. The planning commission may receive reports from the building inspector, the county health specialists and other county department heads, consultants or employees or agents concerning the matter before the commission.

If the application and the plat are not approved, then the building inspector shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the disapproval of the plat or application, and shall attach a copy of the resolution denying the application or plat which resolution shall state the reason for the denial. In the event of disapproval, the applicant may, upon written petition made within ten days of the date of the written notice of disapproval, seek review of the application and plat by the board of commissioners.

                  (2)  Street design conditions. The design of streets where railroads, parkways, grade separations, or freeways are involved shall be subject to conditions imposed by the planning commission as may be required by the circumstances in each case. 
                  (3)  Street names. Street name signs of an approved design shall be installed at all street intersections prior to final plat approval. 
                  (4)  Street name continuation. Each street or way which is the continuation of or approximately the continuation of an existing street or way shall be shown on the preliminary plat and final plat and shall be given the same name as such existing street or way. The proposed names of other streets or ways shown on the preliminary plat shall be submitted to the county administrator for approval. If such name is not a duplication or so nearly the same as to cause confusion with the name of an existing street or way located in the community, if such is appropriate for a street name, such name shall be approved by the planning commission. When such street or way forms a portion of any proposed street or way ordered by the planning commission to be surveyed, opened, widened, or improved, and in such order a name therefor is assigned or designated, the name of such street or way shown on the final plat shall be the same as the name contained in such order. 
                  (5)  Property numbering. When a building or structure is erected on any land covered by this article, the number assigned by the building official shall conform to the existing house numbering system. 
                  (6)  Culs-de-sac. Cul-de-sac or permanent dead-end streets shall be terminated by a turnaround, separated by the depth of one lot from the exterior boundary or topographical boundary of the subdivision. Cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed 1,500 feet in length unless otherwise approved by the planning commission, and they shall terminate in a circular right-of-way with a minimum diameter of 120 feet and a paved diameter of 100 feet. Nonpermanent dead-end streets may exceed 1,000 feet in length, but shall terminate in a turnaround with a minimum right-of-way of 90 feet in diameter. 
                  (7)  Street grades. 
                  a.  A street grade exceeding ten percent for collector streets and 12 percent for local streets will be approved only when conclusive evidence shows that a lesser grade is impractical. 
                  b.  All street grades shall be no less than five percent. 
                  c.  Grades approaching intersections shall not exceed five percent for a distance of not less than 40 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line at the point of intersection. 
                  (8)  Curved streets. 
                  a.  Curved local streets in comparatively level locations (i.e., a cross slope range of zero percent to eight percent) shall have a centerline radius of not less than 250 feet, and in rolling and hilly terrain (i.e., a cross slope of over eight percent) a centerline radius of not less than 150 feet. The minimum sight distance for vertical curves on local streets shall be 150 feet. 
                  b.  Curved collector streets in comparatively level locations (i.e., a cross slope of zero percent to eight percent) shall have a centerline radius of not less than 350 feet, and in rolling and hilly terrain (i.e., a cross slope of over eight percent) not less than 250 feet. The minimum sight distance for vertical curves on collector streets shall be 200 feet, measured between two points four feet above the pavement level. 
                  (9)  Reverse curves. Between reverse curves, there shall be a tangent having a length of not less than the following: 
                  a.  Collector streets, 200 feet. 
                  b.  Local streets, 150 feet. 
                  (10)  Continuity with existing streets. As far as is practical, all proposed streets shall be continuous and made to connect with existing streets without offset. In all cases of offsets, centerline jogs of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted. 
                  (11)  Street intersections. All street intersections and junctions shall be at right angles, unless otherwise approved for good cause by the planning commission, but in no case shall they be less than 70 degrees. In addition, at all street intersections and junctions, there shall be a sight distance of at least 125 feet in all street directions, and the profile flattened at intersections to provide an area of not over five percent grade extending at least 40 feet each way from the intersection. 
                  (12)  Street paving. Streets shall be paved prior to the final plat approval. The paving shall be done within the times and temperatures recommended by the state department of transportation for county maintained roads.

                  ARTICLE IV. - ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS 

                  Section 4.01. - Districts. 
                  The unincorporated portions of Mitchell County are hereby divided into 11 classes of districts known as follows: 

                   
                  Section 4.02. - Limited use (L.U.) provision. 
                  The Mitchell County Commission established the "limited use" provision for the purpose of allowing an applicant to request that a certain area be designated as a limited use. In some areas of the county, a particular land use activity out of a general zoning classification may have less community impact than some of the possibilities of uses in that specific classification. For this reason, an applicant may request in his rezoning petition to limit the use of a proposed property to a specified use only (i.e., C-1 L.U.). To wit: Community business district limited to a "beauty shop". The limited use must be among the uses permitted in the zone classification for which the limited use is taken. 
                  Section 4.03. - District boundaries. 
                  The boundaries of the above districts are shown on a set of maps designated "Official Zoning Maps, Mitchell County, Georgia." The Mitchell County Tax Parcel Maps are the base maps for the county's zoning districts and all of these tax parcel maps are hereby designated AG, agricultural zoning unless otherwise designated on said map. 
                  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as shown on the zoning maps, the following rules shall apply: 
                  A.  Where zoning district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of roads or highways or railroad right-of-way lines extended, such centerlines or railroad right-of-way lines or such lines extended, shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  B.  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the county line, or the corporate limits line of any incorporated place or the militia district line of any militia district, or the land lot line of any land lot; such county line, corporate limits line, militia district line or land lot shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  C.  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately parallel to the center lines of streets or highways, such district boundaries unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at a distance of 200 feet from the right-of-way line of such streets and highways, each above district boundary being shown at scale on the official zoning map of Mitchell County, Georgia. 
                  D.  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline of streambeds or riverbeds, such centerlines or such lines extended shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  Section 4.04. - District boundary lines dividing a lot of single ownership. 
                  Where a district boundary line, as appearing on the zoning map, divides a lot in single ownership at the time of the enactment of these regulations, the requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lines shall be extended to the balance of the lot provided that such extension will not include any part of such lot more than 100 feet beyond the district boundary line without the approval of the planning commission and provided further that this provision shall not apply to a through lot. In the case of a through lot, the restriction of the district applying to the adjoining lots which front on the same street as the proposed use of the lot shall apply.

                  Section 5.18. - Conditional uses. 
                  (Public hearing required). Before a building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a conditional use, application shall be made to the planning commission which, after careful review of any applicable sections of this ordinance, may recommend to the county commission the issuance of such permit or approval, if in the judgment of the planning commission it will not be detrimental to the health, safety, and general welfare of Mitchell County. 
                  An application to establish a conditional use shall be approved following a review by the planning commission and a determination by the Mitchell County Board of Commissioners that: 
                  A.  The proposed use will not be contrary to the purpose of this ordinance. 
                  B.  The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood nor affect adversely the health and safety of residents and workers. 
                  C.  The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such facility, vehicular movement, noise or fumes generation, or type of physical activity. 
                  D.  The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses; and the proposed use will be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use.

                  Section 5.19. - Conditional zoning, limited use. 
                  The Mitchell County Board of Commissioners may change, modify or otherwise impose conditions on any rezoning proposal that would be in the interest of public health, safety or general welfare. 
                  Section 5.20. - Telecommunication antennas and towers. 
                  The purpose of this section is to establish standards and regulations for the siting of antennas and towers. The goals are to: (1) encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the county, (2) encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites, (3) encourage locating towers and antennas, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal, (4) encourage configuration in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas, (5) enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently. 
                  A.  Each applicant requesting a conditional use permit for an antenna and/or tower will be required to submit: 
                  1).  Letter of authorization signed by the owner and notarized granting permission to the agent, with a copy of the lease agreement. 
                  2).  Plat of property and site plan showing approved drives, setbacks, and other ordinance requirements. 
                  3).  DOT/county driveway approval, as required. 
                  4).  FCC and FAA acknowledgement. 
                  5).  Inventory of existing tower sites that are within the county and within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. 
                  6).  Documentation concerning prospective carrier(s). 
                  B.  The following shall govern the location of all towers and the installation of all antennas: 
                  C.  Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the governing authority notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said 90 days, the governing authority may, in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia [O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17], remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower. 
                  Section 5.21. - Appeals and variances. 
                  A.  Appeals: The Mitchell County Board of Commissioners shall hear and decide appeals where there is alleged error in any order, requirements, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator or other administrative official in the enforcement and interpretation of this ordinance. Such appeals shall be made within 30 days of the administrative action by filing with the Mitchell County Clerk and with the Mitchell County Board of Commissioners a "notice of appeal" specifying the grounds thereof. If the notice of appeal is not filed within 30 days, the only recourse shall be a court of record. 
                  The county clerk shall then transmit to the board of commissioners all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken. The appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action, appealed from unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board of commissioners that after the notice of appeal has been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the notice, a stay would in the zoning administrator's opinion, cause immediate peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed, other than by a restraining order, which may, be granted by a court of record. 
                  The board of commissioners shall fix a reasonable amount of time for the hearing of an appeal and shall give due notice to the parties concerned including all landowners within 300 feet of the premises in question. Such notice shall be delivered personally or by mail address to the respective owners at the address given on the last assessment roll. The board of commissioners shall decide the appeal within a reasonable period of time with regard to the purposes of the ordinance. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or agent. 
                  In the event that the petitioner for an appeal remains discontented with the board of commissioners decision on an appeal application, the petitioner shall shave 30 days to appeal the action to the superior court system. 
                  B.  Variances: The planning commission may recommend approval of a variance to the Mitchell County Board of Commissioners which shall have the power to authorize upon appeal such variance from the terms of this resolution as will not be contrary to the public interest, where a literal enforcement of the zoning requirements would result in undue hardship. Variances will first be reviewed by the planning commission and recommendation made to the county commission. (Public hearing required). Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board that: 
                  1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography, and; 
                  2.  The application of the ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship, and; 
                  3.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved, and; 
                  4.  Relief if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public interest or impair the purposes and intent of this ordinance, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building which use is prohibited by this ordinance. The county will control the actual use of properties through zoning and conditional uses and not through a grant of variance. 
                  Section 5.22. - Hardship use variance, manufactured homes/travel trailers. 
                  The planning commission may recommend to the board of commissioners the approval of a hardship use variance for the placement of one manufactured home or travel trailer on a lot where an existing home is located for a one year period. The application for such a variance shall follow the general procedures for the rezoning including advertisement and public hearing requirements. The placement of one hardship manufactured home or travel trailer on an occupied residential lot may be allowed if it is established that a genuine hardship exists only by reason of medical disability or age and all of the following variance criteria are met: 
                  A.  The subject occupant of the manufactured home or travel trailer is a relative by blood or marriage of the owner of the property which shall be shown by sworn affidavit, and; 
                  B.  Documentation of medical disability or age infirmity is required to be certified by a medical doctor's statement. This certification will be valid for a one year period. If an extension is needed after one year, a new application including a medical doctor's statement shall be submitted. Readvertising will not be required and the fee will be waived, and approval can be granted by the zoning administrator, and; 
                  C.  Said manufactured home or travel trailer shall be removed from the premises within 60 days after the specified disability ceases to exist, and; 
                  D.  Under no circumstance shall the manufactured home or travel trailer be rented or otherwise occupied by anyone other than the approved applicant, nor shall it be use for storage, or other similar uses, and; 
                  E.  The Mitchell County Health Department approves the temporary placement of a second dwelling on the proposed property, and; 
                  F.  The planning commission may impose reasonable requirements that would affect the interests of the public health, safety and general welfare.

A rural business is intended to be for commercial uses of smaller size, intensity, and scale than is commonly found in commercial zoning districts. Rural businesses shall be similar to home occupations except that the activity can occur in an accessory structure detached from the principal residence. In addition, an application for rural business must have established residency and be living in residence upon the subject property prior to any application being filed for consideration by the planning commission. 
                  Permitted uses:

                  5.  Any use which is clearly out of scale or character with an agricultural and residential area. 
                  Development standards: 
                  The following standards shall apply to all rural businesses unless specifically exempted by the planning commission. The petitioner must satisfactorily demonstrate that exemption from one or more of these standards will not result in adverse impacts on the surrounding property. The planning commission cannot exempt the following standards: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. A modification of development standards 3, 5, 7, and 8 shall only be permitted if: a) there are special and unusual topographic conditions unique to the property or structure, or (b) the proposed use is of such a small scale that conducting or operating the business would not be obvious or noticeable from the adjoining property or by the public in general, and will remain the same, and (c) a modification of the development standards shall only if the intent of the rural business section is maintained. 
                  1.  An approved rural business should only be valid as long as the original petitioner owns and operates the business and business license is issued to the petitioner.

                  ([See] article XX). 
                  ARTICLE VIII. - R-PUD, RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 

                  Section 8.01. - Residential planned unit developments. 
                  The objective of the planned unit development is to encourage ingenuity, imagination, and flexibility of design efforts on the part of builders, architects, site planners, and developers to produce land developments which are in keeping with density and open space objectives of the zoning resolution, while departing from the strict application of use, setback, height, and minimum lot size requirements of the zoning ordinance. The intent of this section is to permit such flexibility and provide performance criteria for planned developments which: 
                  A.  Permits a creative approach to the residential development. 
                  B.  Provides for an efficient use of land potentially resulting in more economical networks of streets and utilities thereby lowering housing and other land development costs. 
                  C.  Enhances the appearance of neighborhoods through the preservation of natural features, the provision of recreation areas and open space. 
                  D.  Provides an environment of stable character compatible with surrounding residential areas and other areas of Mitchell County. 
                  Section 8.02. - Permitted uses. 
                  In all R-PUD developments, no building or land, except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, shall be erected or used except for one or more of the following specified uses: 
                  A.  One-, two-, and multifamily dwelling units, including townhouse dwellings. 
                  B.  Manufactured homes. 
                  C.  Recreational facilities. 
                  D.  Churches, community clubs. 
                  E.  Schools. 
                  F.  Other governmental functions. 
                  Section 8.03. - Design standards and performance criteria.** 
                  A.  Location. The planned unit development shall have access to streets outside the development that can adequately serve the traffic needs of the development, and also shall be adequately served by water and sewerage systems. 
                  B.  Minimum size. The minimum size shall be three acres. 
                  C.  Density. For the purpose of this ordinance, overall residential density for a planned unit development shall not exceed: One-family dwelling unit: One unit per 7,000 square feet of land. Multifamily unit: one unit per 3,630 square feet of land. 
                  ** The requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings in lots of record, would in certain cases of large-scale developments have results affording less protection to the public health, safety and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of these planned unit developments can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects in adjoining properties. 
                  Therefore, the zoning regulations, relative to area, height, bulk and placement, may be modified by the planning commission and county commission in the case of a plan for a large scale development which in the judgment of the planning commission and county commission, provides adequate open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, education, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in no case may the density of the proposed planned unit development exceed that of the zoning regulation requirements, and provided further that the minimum site for residential planned unit development is three acres. 
                  Section 8.04. - Open space requirement for residential planned unit developments. 
                  A.  As a prerequisite for approval of a R-PUD, residential planned unit development, a minimum of 20 percent excluding rights-of-way, easements or paved areas of the gross residential acres, plus one acre for each 100 residential units shall be allocated to local open space for the use of the residents of the planned unit development. Each two square feet of existing and/or natural water surface, periodically flooded (based upon the 100-year flood contour elevation), or inundated land may be credited as one square foot of land area for required open area. Land below the 100-year flood elevation can only be substituted for one-half of the required open space or common areas. 
                  B.  Common open space must be used for amenity or recreation purposes and must be suitably improved for its intended use. Common open space containing natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved. The buildings, structures, and improvements, which are permitted in the common open space, must be appropriate to the uses which are authorized for the common open space and must conserve and enhance the amenities of the common open space having regard to its topography and unimproved condition. Open space shall not be interpreted to include rights-of-ways, easements, paved areas, pending area of service areas. 
                  C.  The development schedule must coordinate the improvement of the common open space, the construction of the buildings, structures and improvements in the common open space, and the construction of residential dwellings in the planning unit development. 
                  D.  The common open space shall be situated such that is will best serve the residents and be totally integrated within the various land uses of the planned unit development. 
                  Section 8.05. - Access. 
                  Private vehicular access drives not maintained by the county throughout the planned unit development site shall be paved to a minimum width of 20 feet.

                  A.  The minimum distance between the buildings in any category of a PUD district shall be 20 feet. 
                  B.  Multifamily and townhouse structure shall be separated from one another by the following minimum distance: 

                   
                  Section 8.08. - Off-street parking and loading.

                  A.  The minimum setback from the exterior boundaries of the planning unit development site shall be 25 feet or an appropriate setback to be compatible with the adjacent properties and buffered as needed and related to adjacent land development. 
                  B.  Buildings in excess of 35 feet in height shall be located within the planned unit development in such a way as not to invade the privacy of the occupants of buildings of lesser height both on and off site. 
                  C.  Privacy walls and screening shall be provided where deemed necessary by the planning commission for any type of planned unit development. 
                  Section 8.11. - Ownership. 
                  There shall be unified control of the entire site. Prior to final approval of the development plan, evidence of unified control of the entire site must be submitted to the planning and zoning commission. In addition, an agreement by all owners of the planned unit development which includes their commitment to: 
                  A.  Proceed with the proposed development in accordance with the planned unit development plans as submitted, and such conditions and safeguards as may be set by the county commission granting the rezoning, and 
                  B.  Provide agreements, and deed restrictions, acceptable to the county, for completion of such development according to plans approved at the time of rezoning and for the maintenance of such areas, functions, and facilities as are not to be provided, operated or maintained by the county, pursuant to written agreement; and, 
                  C.  To notify and bind their successors in title to any commitments made in their petitions of PUD approval. 
                  D.  All plans approved shall be reviewed as a form of commitment to execute and development precisely as and only as submitted to and ultimately accepted and approved by the county commission. No variations, changes, departures or exceptions to the approved plan shall be permitted except through the formal zoning amendment process. 
                  E.  After PUD zoning has been given formal approval, no use shall be made of a PUD site except that which has been approved as a result of the application or the continuation of uses that existed at the time of application. 
                  Section 8.12. - Phasing of construction. 
                  The phasing of residential construction in any one residential density district shall not exceed the overall density requirement of the planning unit development as a whole. 
                  Section 8.13. - Procedures for PUD rezoning. 
                  A petition for rezoning land to a planned unit development, either residential or commercial PUD district shall be submitted to the zoning administrator the same as any rezoning request. 
                  A.  A written statement to accompany the rezoning petition must contain the following information: 
                  1.  An explanation of the character of the planned unit development and the manner in which it has been planned to take advantage of the planned unit regulations.

                  ARTICLE XIV. - C-PUD COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS 

                  Section 14.01. - Commercial planned unit developments.** 
                  It is the intent of this section to provide areas of sufficient size and allowing reasonable flexibility in design and orientation for the establishment of a group of structures that include two or more retail sales, services and office enterprise on a single parcel of land. 
                  The minimum size of commercial planned unit development shall be three acres. 
                  Within the commercial planned unit development, the following regulations shall apply: 
                  Section 14.02. - Permitted uses. 
                  A.  Any use permitted in C-1, and C-2 zoning districts. 
                  B.  Recreation facilities, churches, and community clubs. 
                  C.  Schools, governmental functions. 
                  Section 14.03. - Procedure for project approval. 
                  In connection with all of the above uses, the following requirements shall be complied with before any building permit is issued. The developer shall furnish the zoning administrator with appropriate copies of the letter of intent and the development plans for any use permitted in the commercial planned unit development, drawn to scale, showing the general location of all buildings, roads, parking area, open areas, sidewalks and street lighting. Typical elevations of all four sides of the proposed buildings, proposed number of units by type and floor space shall be submitted (e.g., furniture sales, 800 square feet). 
                  Section 14.04. - Procedure for preliminary and final approval. 
                  (Shall be in compliance with article VIII, section 8.13). 
                  ** The requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings in lots of record, would in certain cases of large-scale developments have results affording less protection to the public health, safety and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of these planned unit developments can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects in adjoining properties. 
                  Therefore, the zoning regulations, relative to area, height, bulk and placement, may be modified by the planning commission and county commission in the case of a plan for a large scale development which in the judgment of the planning commission and county commission, provides adequate open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, education, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in no case may the density of the proposed planned unit development exceed that of the zoning regulation requirements, and provided further that the minimum site for residential planned unit development is three acres.

                  Section 16.01. - Statement of purpose. 
                  To restrict or prohibit uses which may be dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or which may cause increased flood heights or velocities; to require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be provided with physical flood protection features at the time of initial construction; to protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards; and other public requirements to protect against floods. 
                  Section 16.02. - District boundaries. 
                  For the purpose of these regulations, the Flood Insurance Study for Mitchell County, as prepared by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal Insurance Administration is hereby made a part of these regulations. The Housing and Urban Development report shall be kept permanently in the office of the zoning administrator, where said reports shall be accessible to the general public. The boundaries of the flood hazard district shall be synonymous with the limits of the flood region as determined in the above said study (100-year floodplain).

                  No permit shall be issued for the construction of any building or structure within the flood hazard district until the plans for such construction or use have been submitted to the building inspector and approval is given in writing for such construction or use. In its review of plans submitted, the building inspector shall be guided by the following standards, keeping in mind that the purpose of this district is to prevent encroachment into the floodway which will unduly increase flood heights and endanger life and property. All construction must be in compliance with the Mitchell County Flood Damage Prevention ordinance. 
                  A.  Any structure or the filling of land permitted shall be of a type not appreciably damaged by floodwaters. 
                  B.  Any permitted structures or the filling of land shall be designed, constructed and placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to and effect upon the flow of water. 
                  C.  Any structure, equipment or material permitted shall be firmly anchored to prevent it from floating away and thus damaging other structures and threatening to obstruct bridge openings and other restricted sections of the stream. 
                  D.  Where in the opinion of the planning commission, topographic data, engineering and other studies are needed to determine the effects of flooding on a proposed structure or fill and/or the effect of the structure or fill on the flow of water, the planning commission may require the applicant to submit such data or other studies prepared by competent engineers and other technical people. 
                  E.  The granting of approval of any structure or uses shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind or nature by Mitchell County or by any officer or employee thereof, of the practicality or safety of any structure or use proposed and shall create no liability upon of cause action against such public body, officer or employee for any damage that may result pursuant thereto. 
                  Section 16.05. - Warning of disclaimer of liability. 
                  The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as bridge openings restricted by debris. These regulations do not imply that areas outside the flood district boundaries or land uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the government or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

                  APPENDIX B. - EMPLOYMENT HANDBOOK 
                  INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 
                  Welcome to employment with Mitchell County, Georgia. Mitchell County recognizes that its employees are its most valuable resource. The County recognizes further that all employees, management and non-management alike, can be more productive in an environment in which expectations, working conditions, and rewards are clearly communicated. 
                  This Employment Handbook has been prepared to provide a general description of County programs, policies, and procedures in effect as of the date of publication. It is not intended to address all possible applications of, or exceptions to, the general policies and policies described. It is advisory in nature, and will act as a guide to the County's general practices and procedures in matters of employment. 
                  While it is the County's goal to provide employees and supervisors with beneficial programs, policies, and procedures, all County programs, policies, and procedures are dependent on economic and political considerations and may be changed from time to time by the County at its discretion and without prior notice to employees. This manual creates no contractual obligations on the part of employees, supervisors, or the County. The County retains all of its rights to change, modify, revise, or alter policies, benefits, or other conditions of employment at any time and for any reason, and to hire, transfer, discipline, separate, and otherwise manage its employees as it feels appropriate. 
                  This Handbook is not intended to and does not create an employment contract between Mitchell County and its employees. Employment is for no specific period of time, and this Handbook does not limit an employee's right or the County's right to terminate employment at any time for any reason or no reason. The employment at will relationship exists for all employees, unless otherwise specified by state law or unless the employee is covered by a civil service system. 
                  Some of the information described in this Handbook is discussed in detail in official policy documents. Employees should refer to such official policy documents for specific information, since this Handbooks is intended to only summarize those benefits. Please note that the terms of the written insurance policies are controlling documents. 
                  Employees must sign the Acknowledgment Form contained within to acknowledge receipt of this Handbook, and must read the Employment Handbook upon hire and/or upon revision/updating of the Handbook. Employees should retain a copy of the Handbook and [refer] to it as needed during employment. If any employee should have a question concerning a policy, practice, benefit, or other aspect of employment, the employee should contact his/her supervisor, the County Administrator, or other appropriate official for clarification. 
                  EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGMENT FORM 
                  I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the Mitchell County Employment Handbook, and have been asked to read its contents. I understand that it is my responsibility to read and comply with the policies contained in this Handbook and any revisions made to it. I understand that I should contact my immediate supervisor or other appropriate County management personnel if there is anything I do not understand in this Handbook, or if I need additional information. 
                  I understand that Mitchell County is an "at will" employer and, as such, employment with Mitchell County is not for a fixed term or definite period and may be terminated at the will of either party, with or without cause, and without prior notice. No supervisor or other representative of the County (except the appointing officials) has the authority to enter into any agreement for employment for any specified period of time, or to make any agreement contrary to the above. 
                  In addition, I understand that this Handbook states Mitchell County's policies and practices in effect on the date of publication. I understand that nothing contained in the Handbook may be construed as creating a promise of future benefits or a binding contract with Mitchell County for benefits or for any other purpose. I also understand that these policies and procedures are continually evaluated and may be amended, modified, or terminated at any time. 

                   
                  Sign, tear out, and return this Acknowledgment Form to Management. 
                  SECTION A. - GENERAL PROVISIONS AND PRACTICES 

                  A-1. - Personnel Policy Actions. 
                  Establishment of Personnel Policies. The personnel policies and procedures contained in this Handbook have been voluntarily established by the Board of Commissioners and Constitutional Officers of the County. They are intended to standardize the personnel practices in the various departments where standardization is possible, and to extend certain privileges to the employees of some departments headed by Constitutional officers. 
                  Under Article IX of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, the General Assembly may, by general law, authorize the establishment by county-governing authorities of civil service systems covering county employees. The General Assembly has passed such an act, but there is no intention of establishing a civil service system with the policies contained within this Handbook. Mitchell County is an "at-will" employer, and reserves the rights, powers, privileges, responsibilities, duties, and circumstances unique to and associated with an "at-will" employer. 
                  In establishing these policies and procedures, the Constitutional Officers are not relinquishing their constitutional authority as appointing authorities, nor are they or the Board of Commissioners creating a property interest for employees in any County department that leads to the expectancy of continued employment at any time, in any position, pay grade, or pay step. The policies and procedures are considered good personnel practices and are consistent with the above-stated goals. 
                  Purpose of Personnel Policies - The purpose of these policies and procedures includes the following: 
                  1.  To establish uniform benefits and procedures; 
                  2.  To ensure equal employment opportunity; and 
                  3.  To comply with all mandatory state and federal laws related to employment. 
                  Personnel Policy Coverage - The personnel policies contained in this Handbook apply to all employees in the departments under the authority of the Board of Commissioners and to certain employees of Constitutional Officers who have voluntarily agreed to participate in these personnel policies and procedures. Constitutional Officers will indicate their voluntary participation in these policies via written communication to the Board of Commissioners, and by their signature, agree to follow the procedures and provisions herein. 
                  Federal law recognizes that neither elected officials nor members of their personal staffs should be covered by rules or regulations which imply specific employment practices. Therefore, the elected officials will determine which positions in their departments are policy-making or personal staff and exclude those positions from the Classification Plan; all other subordinate positions will be included. By including certain positions, the elected officials are not redefining the relationship between themselves and their employees as defined by the Constitution of the State of Georgia; they are merely voluntarily extending the personnel policies and procedures to as many employees as possible. 
                  The following positions are expressly excluded from all provisions of these policies and procedures: Board of Commissioners, Constitutional Officers, members of any appointed board or commission, individuals paid on a contractual or retainer basis, individuals employed to make or conduct a temporary or special inquiry, and any employees identified by an appointing authority as policy-making or personal staff. 
                  Personnel Policy Administration - The County Administrator is responsible for administering these policies for departments falling underneath the direct authority of the Board of Commissioners, either directly or through delegation of this responsibility to subordinate department heads. Constitutional Officers are responsible for administering these policies for their respective departments. The County Administrator will provide administrative support to departments under Constitutional Officers; the Board of Commissioners will become directly involved in administering policies in all departments where budget and funding are concerned. For the purposes of this document, reference to "the County" is intended to denote the appropriate appointing authority or policy administrator. 
                  It is the responsibility of each employee to cooperate with the policies and practices described in this Handbook. Any employee or applicant who believes that they have not been accorded treatment conforming to these policies is urged to discuss the matter with his/her supervisor or department head, or with the appointing authority. 
                  Printing and Distribution of Policies - The personnel policies and procedures contained in the Mitchell County Employment Handbook will be printed and distributed to each County employee who is covered by these policies. Each department head will be responsible for reviewing policies and procedures with each covered employee in that department. Each covered employee will be required to acknowledge by signature that they have received and reviewed a copy of the policies and procedures. That signed acknowledgment will be maintained in the employee's personnel file. 
                  Policy Changes - The policies, procedures, and provisions of this Handbook have been developed at the discretion of the Board of Commissioners and Constitutional Officers and, except for its policy of employment-at-will, may be amended or cancelled at any time, at management's sole discretion. These provisions supersede all existing policies and practices and may not be amended or added to without the express written approval of the Board of Commissioners and Constitutional Officers. These policies shall reflect, and be superseded by, any changes mandated by State or Federal legislation. 
                  Mitchell County benefit plans are defined in legal documents such as insurance contracts, official plan documents, and trust agreements. If questions should arise about the nature and/or extent of plan benefits, or if there is conflicting language, the formal language of the plan documents will govern, not the informal wording of this policy handbook. Plan documents are available for inspection in the human resources office. 
                  All County programs, policies, and procedures are dependent on economic, political, and legal considerations and may be changed from time to time by the County at its discretion and without prior notice to employees. The County retains all of its rights to change, modify, revise, or alter policies, benefits, or other conditions of employment at any time and for any reason, and to hire, transfer, discipline, separate, and otherwise manage its employees as it feels appropriate. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  A-2. - "At-Will" Nature of Employment. 
                  All employees of Mitchell County Government are "at-will" employees. Employment with Mitchell County is entered into on a voluntary basis, and all employees are employed for an indefinite time period. Either the employer or the employee is free to terminate the employment relationship at any time without notice, for any reason or for no reason at all. 
                  Policies and guidelines set forth in this Employment Handbook are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations of any kind or a contract of employment between the County and any of its employees. In no case should any provisions of this Handbook be interpreted as an act of conveying the expectation of continued employment to an employee or any other relaxation of the employment "at-will" doctrine of Mitchell County. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  A-3. - Equal Employment Opportunity. 
                  It is the policy of Mitchell County Government to provide equal employment opportunities to all applicants and employees of the County. Mitchell County Government does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national or ethnic origin, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, veteran status, disability, political affiliation, or any other characteristic protected by law. All employment decisions by the County will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities, and will be made in a fair, equitable, and non-discriminatory manner. This policy relates to all phases of employment, including recruitment, placement, transfer, promotion, demotion, termination, compensation, benefits, County-sponsored training, layoff, recall from layoff, participation in County-sponsored employee activities, and all other aspects of personnel administration. 
                  The County does not and will not permit its employees to engage in unlawful discriminatory practices. Any County employee found to be engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
                  Any applicant or employee with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination in the workplace is encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of the immediate supervisor or to appropriate County management personnel. A thorough investigation of the complaint will be conducted. If any employee is not satisfied with the outcome of the investigation, the employee should follow the grievance procedures described in this Handbook. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  A-4. - Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Compliance. 
                  Mitchell County is committed to complying fully with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and ensuring equal opportunity in employment for qualified persons with disabilities. The ADA requires that individuals with disabilities be given the same employment opportunities and services available to people without disabilities. Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to equal pay and other forms of compensation (or changes in compensation). 
                  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) describes an individual with a disability as one who has either a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a person's ability to perform "life activities" such as eating, sleeping, walking, talking, seeing, hearing, breathing, learning, working, or taking care of oneself. A qualified individual is anyone who has the skills, experience, and education required for the job and can perform the job's essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation. 
                  It is Mitchell County's policy that all employment actions be conducted on a non-discriminatory basis. All employment decisions are based on the merits of the situation in accordance with defined criteria, not the disability of the individual. This policy governs all aspects of employment, including selection, job assignment, compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training. 
                  If a person with a disability is unable to perform an essential function of the job because of the disability, the County will then consider whether there is reasonable accommodation that would enable the person to perform the job (such as restructuring the job, changing the work schedule, or acquiring/modifying equipment). Reasonable accommodation is available to all disabled employees, in cases where their disability affects the performance of job functions, unless doing so would result in an undue hardship. 
                  Employees with life threatening illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, and AIDS, often wish to continue their normal pursuits, including work, to the extent allowed by their condition. The County supports these endeavors as long as employees are able to meet acceptable performance standards. As in the case of other disabilities, the County will make reasonable accommodations, in accordance with all legal requirements, to allow qualified employees with life threatening illnesses to perform the essential functions of their jobs. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  A-5. - Harassment. 
                  Mitchell County is committed to maintaining a work environment free of any and all harassment, including harassment on the basis of a person's race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender, disability, age, veteran status, citizenship, sexual orientation, or other protected group status. To assist in preventing or eliminating any such unwelcome harassment, Mitchell County will not tolerate any form of harassment or unlawful discrimination by or against its employees, supervisors, managers, and elected officials. 
                  Discriminatory Harassment - Discriminatory harassment includes any form of harassment related to an individual's race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender, disability, age, veteran status, citizenship, sexual orientation, or other protected group status. It may include conduct that has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance, or conduct that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment for an employee, whether verbal, physical, or visual. Offensive remarks, comments, jokes, slurs, practical jokes, photographs, pictorial representations, reading materials, e-mails, gestures, or other actions that are negative or derisive of the categories mentioned above may constitute harassment. Any such conduct which interferes with an employee's ability to perform his/her job or which creates a hostile, offensive, or intimidating work environment will not be tolerated and will subject the employee displaying such conduct to disciplinary action. 
                  Sexual Harassment - Sexual harassment may include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, promises of benefits in exchange for sexual favors, threats of reprisal for refusal to engage in social or sexual relations, sexually suggestive and offensive language, and other verbal and physical contact of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment occurs when submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of the individual's employment, when submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for employment decisions, or when such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the individual's work performance or the conduct creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. A sexually offensive environment can be created by behavior that includes (but is not limited to) any of the following: 
                  •  Sexual assaults, rape, or molestation (or attempts or threats to commit such acts); 
                  •  Unwelcome, intentional, physical contact of a sexual nature (such as touching, pinching, patting, grabbing, kissing, brushing or poking of another person's body); 
                  •  Offensive sexual remarks, sexual advances, or requests for sexual favors; 
                  •  Preferential treatment (or the promise of same) for engaging in sexual conduct; 
                  •  Offensive pictures, photos, drawings, reading materials, calendars, e-mails, objects, or other items that are sexually suggestive, demeaning, or pornographic; 
                  •  Suggestions that employment, advancement, or treatment will be affected in any way by entering (or refusing to enter) into any form of personal or sexual relationship; 
                  •  Threats of reprisals for refusal to respond to requests for sexual favors; 
                  •  Retaliating against a person in any way because he/she has resisted or reported sexual harassment; or 
                  •  Or any other conduct which makes an employee feel uncomfortable while at work. 
                  Complaint Procedures - Each employee has a responsibility to inform an individual whenever his/her behavior is unwelcome, offensive, in poor taste, or inappropriate. Any employee who believes that they have been the victim of discriminatory harassment or sexual harassment, or who has knowledge of that kind of behavior, is urged to report such conduct immediately to his/her supervisor, the County Administrator, or other appropriate official. Incidents reported will be handled promptly, thoroughly, and as confidentially as possible. No employee will be penalized in any way for making a complaint of harassment or for reporting knowledge of harassment (unless investigation shows a report or complaint to be false and made with malicious intent). If an investigation confirms that harassment has occurred, the offender will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
                  Retaliation Prohibited - Mitchell County prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports discrimination or harassment or participates in an investigation of such reports. Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or discrimination or for participating in an investigation of a claim of harassment or discrimination is a serious violation of this policy and, like harassment or discrimination itself, will be subject to disciplinary action. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  A-6. - Immigration Law Compliance. 
                  Mitchell County is committed to full compliance with federal immigration laws, and will hire only United States citizens and aliens who are authorized to work in the United States. These laws require that all individuals pass an employment verification procedure before they are permitted to work. 
                  In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, each new (and rehired) employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility. This proof of legal authority to work in the United States must be presented within no later than three (3) business days of the first day of employment. Failure to provide such identification as outlined on the Form I-9 will result in immediate termination of employment. 
                  Former employees who are rehired must also complete the form if they have not completed an I-9 with Mitchell County within the past three years, or if their previous Form I-9 is no longer retained or valid. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  A-7. - Workplace Safety. 
                  Mitchell County Government strives to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. To do this, all employees have a responsibility to learn and practice safe methods of performing their jobs, and to report any potentially hazardous condition observed in the workplace. 
                  Injury/Accident Reporting - All injuries and accidents must be reported to the immediate supervisor and/or department head, no matter how minor the injury may appear to be. This ensures prompt and appropriate medical treatment, allows for timely completion of required reports in accordance with law, and enables eligible employees to qualify for coverage as quickly as possible. If medical attention by a physician is needed, the employee must use one of the physicians specifically listed on the Worker's Compensation Notice posted by the County on the official bulletin board (or other designated location). Failure to report an injury or to receive medical treatment will jeopardize payment of medical bills or other benefits under worker's compensation insurance. 
                  Safety Guidelines for All Employees - All employees should be trained in the correct way to perform their jobs. Any questions or suggestions about better or safer methods of performing tasks should be discussed with the supervisor or manager. Employees should always be conscious of the safety of others, as well as themselves. Employees should always observe the following guidelines: 
                  1.  Observe all safety practices and procedures relating to the work performed. 
                  2.  Only operate machinery assigned to them and for which they have received full training. 
                  3.  Use proper safety clothing, equipment, and personal protective gear wherever provided, assigned, or required, as designated for the work performed. 
                  4.  Use appropriate, safe methods to lift heavy objects, and use back braces, handcarts, or other devices to assist with lifting or moving activities. 
                  5.  Never endanger themselves or another individual through inappropriate actions or by taking unnecessary chances. 
                  6.  Be prepared for fire or other emergency situations - know what to do; what actions to take; where to go; and the location of exits, fire fighting equipment, and alarm pulls within the work environment. 
                  7.  Notify supervisors or managers of any unsafe conditions, accidents, damaged or malfunctioning vehicles or equipment, any employee who is performing his/her job in an unsafe manner, or any other type of hazardous situation. 
                  8.  Observe proper maintenance practices to keep work area, vehicles, tools, or other equipment in clean, safe, and operable condition. 
                  9.  In compliance with state law, no employee under the age of eighteen (18) is allowed to operate heavy motor-driven equipment.

                  A-8. - Workplace Security. 
                  Mitchell County is concerned about the well-being and personal safety of its employees and anyone doing business with the County. The County consequently strictly prohibits workplace violence. All reports of incidents will be taken seriously and addressed appropriately. 
                  Any act of violence and/or threat of violence, whether expressed or implied, toward individuals in the County workplace, is prohibited and will not be tolerated. In addition, unauthorized firearms, weapons, ammunition, or explosives on County property is strictly prohibited. Employees are expected to refrain from fighting or other conduct that may be dangerous to others. Any conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another employee, a customer, or a member of the public (including all acts of harassment) will not be tolerated. 
                  Employees should immediately report any suspicious individuals or activities or any actual or threat of violence, both direct and indirect, to the immediate supervisor or any other member of management. This includes threats by employees, customers, vendors, or other members of the public. When reporting a threat of violence, the employee should be as specific and detailed as possible. 
                  Mitchell County will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats or acts of violence and of suspicious individuals or activities. In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, the County may suspend employees, either with or without pay, pending investigation. Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of (or actual) violence or other conduct that is in violation of these guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 
                  Search Policy - Mitchell County cannot be responsible for any loss or damage to personal property or valuables of employees or others using the premises. However, it is the County's intent to take the necessary actions to safeguard employees while on the job, as well as to protect County property. 
                  If the County reasonably suspects that an employee may have violated this policy, or that the employee possesses evidence that may be considered a threat of workplace violence, the County may request the individual to submit to a search of his or her person, vehicle, or personal effects. In addition, all County property, including but not limited to desks, file cabinets, lockers, vehicles, computers, e-mail, voicemail, business records, or other property, is subject to inspection at any time and for any reason. No employee shall have any privacy interest whatsoever in any County-owned or County-issued property. If a search uncovers evidence of illegal activity, employee wrong-doing, or violations of County rules or policies, the evidence may be used to support disciplinary actions up to, and including, termination. In cases involving suspected illegal activities, the evidence may be turned over to the proper legal authorities. 
                  Security Clearance - In certain employment areas, such as accounting, finance, public safety, or other areas where the public has a compelling interest in the security of property or life, applicants for employment, promotion, or transfer may be required to provide additional personal information that would not be needed in other areas of employment. Such applicants/employees may also be subject to additional background screening, which may include driver's history reports, criminal history reports, credit reports, or other review. County employees may also be required to meet requirements to be bonded under a blanket policy at the County's expense, to satisfy the requirements of state and federal agencies.

                  B-1. - Policy Overview. 
                  The proper operation of County Government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial, and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made through proper channels of the government structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. 
                  County employees are in a unique category. Not only are they employed by the County - more importantly, they serve the citizens of Mitchell County. Employees have an obligation not only to their supervisors, department heads, Board of Commissioners, and other elected officials - but also to the public. County employees are highly visible to the community, and must adhere to high moral and ethical standards in their work activities and personal conduct. Each employee has an obligation to conduct County business within guidelines that prevent actual or potential conflicts of interest. 
                  The purpose of these guidelines is to provide general direction and clarification on issues involving acceptable standards of operation. While it is not possible to outline specific rules to govern each employee's conduct in all aspects of the job, this section of the Handbook sets forth some common or frequent situations which may arise, and provides guidelines to assist employees in carrying out duties in a professional manner. Also, it is not the County's intent to dictate the non-working time of County employees; however, when off-duty conduct has an impact on County operations or brings discredit on County Government, such conduct does legitimately become a concern and can result in disciplinary action against the employee concerned. Contact the County Administrator for specific information or questions about issues involving business ethics. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  B-2. - Code of Ethics. 
                  Employees of Mitchell County are expected to comply with the code of ethics for government service as established by the State of Georgia (O.C.G.A. 45-10-1), which states that any person in government service should: 
                  •  Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or government department. 
                  •  Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of the United States and the State of Georgia and of all governments therein and never be a party to their evasion. 
                  •  Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay and give to the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought. 
                  •  Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished. 
                  •  Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not, and never accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties. 
                  •  Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty. 
                  •  Engage in no business with the government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of his governmental duties. 
                  •  Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit. 
                  •  Expose corruption wherever discovered. 
                  •  Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  B-3. - Conflicts of Interest. 
                  Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for the employee or a relative as a result of the County's business dealings. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood or marriage, or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage. 
                  The following restrictions govern compliance with this policy: 
                  •  No employee or relative may use his/her position and influence as a County employee to promote personal gain, or to benefit friends, relatives, or associates. 
                  •  No employee or relative may have substantial ownership in a company holding a contract with the County or an affiliated agency. 
                  •  No employee or relative may acquire an interest in any contract at a time when they have reason to believe that such interest will be affected by actions of the employee or the County. 
                  •  No employee or relative may hold investments in real property or business in the immediate vicinity of a County project that might appear to be speculative. 
                  •  No employee or relative may receive any kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of any transaction or business dealings involving the County. 
                  •  If any employee has a financial interest in a business or activity that they have reason to believe may be affected by his/her official actions or by the actions of the County, the employee must disclose the exact nature and value of the interest. 
                  •  Any employee with a conflict of interest as described above must disqualify himself/herself from participating in any official action directly affecting this interest. 
                  No "presumption of guilt" is created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms. However, if an employee has any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that they discloses to the County Administrator (or other appropriate County representative) the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest as soon as possible, so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties. All purchasing transactions should be conducted in accordance with the County's established purchasing policies and procedures. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  B-4. - Gifts, Gratuities, and Favors. 
                  No employee may request or receive (directly or indirectly) any gift, gratuity, favor, or loan if it tends to influence (or may appear to influence) the employee's judgments or actions in the performance of duties. In addition, no employee may accept any gift, gratuity, favor, or loan from any individual, organization, or business concern who seeks to gain from the County, or with whom the employee has an official business relationship as a County employee. Special care must be taken to avoid even the impression of a conflict of interest. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  B-5. - Civic and Political Activities. 
                  Employees are encouraged to engage in outside community activities, including civic organizations and political activities. However, unless officially authorized by the Board of Commissioners or other elected officials, such activities should occur during non-working time. 
                  Civic Activities - Employees should use good judgment to ensure their civic activities do not conflict with the interests of the County. Further, employees' civic activities should not affect their ability to perform the essential functions of their jobs, and off-duty conduct of employees should not have a negative impact on County operations or bring discredit on County Government. 
                  Political Activities - No employee covered under these policies may engage in political activities at the work place or during business hours. No employee may make use of County time, County equipment, or other County resources and assets to aid a political candidate, political party, or political cause; nor may any employee use his/her County position to persuade, coerce, or intimidate any person in the interest of a political candidate, party, or cause. All employees of Mitchell County have a right to be free of any and all political persuasion or coercion in relationship to their employment, and should report any such job-related activity to the County Administrator. Employees may express their political opinions privately, and the County encourages employees to vote for the candidates of their choice. Employees who are running against an incumbent elected official in the same department are encouraged to resign from employment with the County. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  B-6. - Confidential Information. 
                  During the course of employment, employees often learn restricted or confidential information regarding County operations or activities, local businesses and associates, and the personal business of citizens. Employees must take extreme care in how they handle information learned in the course of their job, and should not discuss such information with any unauthorized person, either inside or outside the workplace, except as allowed by law. Revealing confidential information may be considered grounds for dismissal. 
                  The following restrictions govern compliance with this policy: 
                  •  No employee may use any confidential information acquired through their employment with the County for private gain or for the private gain of any other persons or groups. 
                  •  Employee medical information is required to be treated in a strictly confidential manner. All employees must respect and maintain the confidentiality of employee medical information, and take reasonable precautions to protect such information from inappropriate disclosure. 
                  •  Information regarding employee compensation and benefits is considered strictly confidential, and employees should not discuss such issues with other employees or individuals other than the immediate supervisor, manager, or County Administrator. 
                  The County complies with all laws that govern protection of information as well as lawful disclosure of information. Certain information maintained by the County may be considered public information subject to inspection under the Georgia Open Records Act. Any legal requests for information under the Georgia Open Records Act should be directed to your supervisor or department head. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  B-7. - Outside Employment or Business Activity. 
                  Outside employment by full-time County employees is discouraged because it is likely to interfere with the employee's regular work with the County. No employee may engage in outside employment or private business during hours for which they are being compensated by the County, or outside such hours to an extent that it may affect the employee's usefulness to the County. No employee may use County equipment, materials, supplies, or property to engage in any outside employment or business activity. Further, outside business activity or employment is strictly prohibited whenever the outside activity conflicts with the business interests or other interests of the County, would reflect adversely on the County, or would raise the appearance of, or potential for, a conflict of interest. 
                  Any County employee must receive advance approval from the department head and/or the County Administrator or department head before accepting or engaging in any outside business activity or employment. If such activity should create a conflict of interest situation between the employee and the County, the employee will be expected to resign one of the positions, or termination of employment with the County may result. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  B-8. - Nepotism/Employment of Relatives. 
                  It is the County's policy to avoid hiring individuals who are relatives of (or who have personal relationships with) any County employee or official for positions that may involve or lead to conflicts of interest, complaints of favoritism, lack of objectivity, or morale/dissension problems in the workplace. This policy applies to hiring, promotions, demotions, transfers, and reinstatements and applies to all employees and elected/appointed officials. 
                  Employment of relatives is prohibited when one relative is placed in the direct line of supervision of another, i.e. they might have an effect on a relative's progress, performance, discipline, promotion, training, testing, or welfare as an employee. 
                  For purposes of this nepotism policy, a "relative" is defined as a spouse, domestic partner, son/daughter, parent, brother/sister, aunt/uncle, or niece/nephew (including any "step", "foster", "half", "grand", "in-law" or "ex" relationship of same); or any person who shares the same household with the employee; or any similar relationship. This policy is not limited to relatives, and also applies to romantic relationships, economic relationships (such as landlord or creditor), or other relationships between employees in which actual or potential conflicts of interest in the workplace may exist. 
                  If, by reason of marriage or cohabitation, County employees come to be in violation of this policy, one or the other must accept a job reassignment of equal or lesser pay, if available, or must elect to resign their position within sixty (60) days of said marriage or cohabitation. If that decision is not made within sixty (60) days by the individuals involved, the County will initiate appropriate action. Exclusion - This section does not apply to any situations which constitute a violation of this policy at the time of this policy's adoption, provided that such a relationship is made known to the County. 
                  SECTION C. - DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE 

                  C-1. - Drug-Free Workplace Policy. 
                  Employees who abuse drugs and alcohol are not only a danger to themselves, but to fellow employees and the community served. The use of alcohol or controlled substances by County employees while on the job constitutes a direct threat to the property and safety of others. The safety of citizens and other employees depends upon the ability of employees to think clearly with unimpaired faculties. In addition, medical costs incurred by employees with drug or alcohol problems are much higher than those of other employees, and the decreased productivity of these individuals due to absenteeism and turnover can adversely affect the County's ability to perform necessary services for its citizens. 
                  It is the policy of Mitchell County that its workplace shall be drug-free, in compliance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-690, Title V, Subtitle D). All employees are notified, and sign statements acknowledging such notification, that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of controlled substance (defined in Schedules I through V of Section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 812, and further defined in Regulation 21 CFR 1308.15) is prohibited in the workplace. 
                  As a condition of employment, employees will: 
                  1.  Abide by the terms of this statement; and 
                  2.  Notify their department head of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five (5) days after such conviction. 
                  Penalties for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace will include: 
                  1.  Taking appropriate personnel action, up to and including termination; and 
                  2.  Requiring the employee to participate satisfactorily in an appropriate drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program. 
                  Mitchell County's policy concerning the use of illegal drugs and abuse of alcohol applies to all employees on Mitchell County's payroll, and is intended to protect the health and safety of County employees and the public. All employees and managers are required to join the County in implementation of this policy. 
                  It is recognized that early treatment is the key to rehabilitation for substance abusers. Our policy is to assist employees with problems associated with abuse of drugs and alcohol, and to encourage rehabilitation. Employees are encouraged to voluntarily request help. No employee will have job security jeopardized by such a good faith request. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  C-2. - Drug and Alcohol Testing of Applicants. 
                  Any offer of employment is contingent upon the applicant successfully completing the drug-screening test. No individual will be permitted to begin work until test results have been obtained. The County will not hire any applicant who: (1) refuses to submit to a drug test; (2) tests positive for use of illegal or unauthorized substances; and/or (3) tests positive for the presence of prescription drugs that could impair their physical, mental, emotional, or other faculties (such as barbiturates, amphetamines, opiates, etc.) unless the applicant has a current prescription and a valid medical reason for the use of such drugs. 
                  An applicant who is rejected under this policy may be considered for future vacancies if the applicant can demonstrate that they no longer use any such substances (for example, the applicant may successfully complete a drug abuse treatment program and pass a more thorough drug test, conducted at the applicant's expense). 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  C-3. - Drug and Alcohol Testing of Commercial Drivers. 
                  Mitchell County maintains a policy to comply with the Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements governing alcohol and drug testing of all drivers (and driver applicants) who operate a commercial vehicle in excess of 26,000 pounds. All County drivers who operate such a commercial vehicle, regardless of how often, are subject to DOT alcohol and drug testing under this policy. All DOT-mandated tests are separate from and in addition to any drug tests which may be required by Mitchell County in other instances. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  C-4. - Prohibited Activities. 
                  The following actions are prohibited for all employees: 
                  1.  The possession, use, transfer, manufacturer, or sale of alcohol, illegal drugs, or legal drugs without a valid prescription from a licensed medical or dental practitioner during working time, on County property, or while operating or riding in a County-provided vehicle, or any vehicle being used for County business, is prohibited. Obviously, this does not prevent County employees from possessing or transporting alcohol or illegal drugs as part of their job duties (such as a law enforcement officer who transports seized cocaine). 
                  2.  The possession or consumption of alcohol on County property or on County time, or while operating or riding in a County-provided vehicle, or any vehicle being used for County business, is prohibited. 
                  3.  Reporting for duty or working with drugs present in the body or while affected by alcohol will be handled through disciplinary procedures or referral for counseling or rehabilitation, as determined by management. This prohibition includes prescription drugs, unless the employee has a current legal prescription and a valid medical reason for using such prescription drug. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  C-5. - Notification Procedure for Authorized Use of Prescription Drugs. 
                  In order to assure that employees can safely perform their jobs, employees using prescription drugs according to a physician's instructions or using over-the-counter drugs for medicinal purposes should notify their supervisor or department head immediately upon reporting for work, in the event that such drugs could impair their physical, mental, emotional, or other faculties. Failure to do so may be considered a violation of this policy and is cause for disciplinary action. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  C-6. - Violations of Drug-Free Workplace Policy. 
                  Employees who violate these prohibitions are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, depending on considerations such as nature of the offense, employee's current job assignment, employee's record with the County, and possible adverse consequence to the County. Any circumstances indicating a violation of federal, state, or local laws may be reported to appropriate law enforcement officials, and the County will cooperate in any criminal prosecutions. 
                  Special Provisions for Employees Operating County-Provided Vehicles, or Personal Vehicles on County Business - Substance abuse by employees who operate County-provided vehicles or their personal vehicles on County business can create a very serious risk for both themselves and members of the public. The County believes employee behavior off-the-job can influence behavior on-the-job. Therefore, the following rules and disciplinary action will apply to those employees: 
                  1.  Employees who operate County-provided vehicles will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, for a conviction of driving that vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This provision applies regardless of whether the vehicle is being operated for personal or business use. 
                  2.  Employees who operate their personal vehicle on County business will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, for a conviction of driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs when the employee is operating that vehicle on County business. For purposes of this paragraph, "operating on County business" means that the employee would be entitled to reimbursement by the County for that specific trip. 
                  3.  Employees who operate a vehicle as an integral part of their job, such as County truck drivers, are subject to disciplinary action for a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, even if such offense occurred in the employee's personal vehicle and not while on County business. The first such conviction subjects an employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The second such conviction in a twelve (12) month period will result in termination of employment. 
                  4.  Any employees covered under the above provisions must report to their department head any citation alleging that they were driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, regardless of whether the offense occurred in the employee's personal vehicle, in a County-provided vehicle, or other vehicle, while on personal business or on County business. Failure to report any such citation may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The report must be made within five (5) days of the citation, unless the employee is unable to make such report due to extenuating circumstances, in which case the notification must occur as soon as possible. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  C-7. - Drug and Alcohol Testing of Employees. 
                  The County may require an employee to undergo a medical examination and/or a drug/alcohol-screening test under the following circumstances: 
                  1.  Accident or Incident - An employee will be tested if they are involved in an accident or injury on the job. 
                  2.  Reasonable Suspicion or Evidence of Substance Abuse - The County may determine to test an employee on the basis of reasonable cause or suspicion that the employee may be a substance abuser or in violation of the County's substance abuse policy. Reasonable suspicion must be based upon objective indications of substance abuse and confirmed by a concurring opinion from a second supervisor. 
                  3.  Random Testing - All County employees will be subject to random testing in accordance with procedures established by the County's designated testing lab and the County Administrator in an effort to meet the County's goal of being a Drug-Free Workplace. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  C-8. - Drug Testing Procedures. 
                  Except in unusual circumstances, before employees are requested to submit to a medical examination or drug/alcohol screening test, concurrence of the County Administrator will be obtained. 
                  1.  A testing request form will be completed. 
                  2.  The employee will be met with in private by his/her department head. 
                  3.  The employee will be asked to consent to any search, medical examination, and/or drug/alcohol screening test; will be asked to cooperate; and will be informed that submission to the search, examination, and/or screening test is a condition of employment. Failure to cooperate should result in immediate suspension without pay, and is grounds for termination of employment. 
                  4.  If the employee agrees to the examination and/or screening test, they will sign a release of liability form. 
                  5.  The department head, with concurrence of the County Administrator, will make the decision concerning whether the employee will remain on the job or be suspended without pay until results of the examination and/or drug screening test are received. This decision will be based on their sole judgment as to whether the employee poses any danger to fellow employees or to the public. 
                  6.  If an employee refuses to cooperate or to agree to the search, examination, and/or drug-screening test, the employee will be suspended without pay pending final decision regarding termination of employment.

                  C-9. - Test Results and Subsequent Actions. 
                  The following procedures pertain to conducting of tests, handling of test results, and actions to be taken after tests: 
                  1.  Collection of Fluids - Procedures established by the County's designated testing laboratory and the County Administrator will be followed for collection of sample body fluids. In situations where drug screen tests are administered pursuant to state/federal regulations, any procedure specified therein will be followed. 
                  2.  Negative Test Results - Negative test results will be communicated confidentially to the employee by the appropriate member of management. 
                  3.  Adulterated or Unreadable Samples - Adulterated or unreadable samples that are clearly not authentic will be considered as evidence of an employee's failure to cooperate with County policy. The employee will be given an opportunity to provide an explanation. If a satisfactory explanation is not provided, the employee is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 
                  4.  Positive Test Results - Positive test results may be confirmed by a second test of the original sample. The employee will be provided with the results of the test and given an opportunity to explain the result. If a satisfactory explanation is not provided, the employee will be disciplined and/or referred for appropriate counseling and rehabilitation, or employment will be terminated, as determined by the County. For positive test results, the employee may be offered an additional confirmatory drug test on the original sample, at the employee's expense. Arrangements for the confirmatory test should be made with the County Administrator. A confirmatory test should be a second gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test performed on the original sample. 
                  In the case of positive test results, if the employee agrees to referral for counseling or rehabilitation, they should be advised that this counseling represents the final chance for assistance. If the employee refuses referral for counseling or rehabilitation, they will be suspended pending final action or termination. 
                  5.  Failure of an Employee to Cooperate - Employee compliance with the County's program is a condition of employment. Failure or refusal of any employee to fully cooperate and participate in the program, to sign any required document, or to submit to a drug/alcohol test will be grounds for termination of employment, unless a compelling, satisfactory reason is provided. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  C-10. - Counseling or Rehabilitation Procedures. 
                  Employees who continue employment while undergoing counseling or rehabilitation will be required to meet all established standards of conduct and job performance. Employees who have been referred for counseling or rehabilitation under this policy will be required to participate in and fully cooperate with their rehabilitation and with the recommendations of the program administrators. This may include the requirement for regular attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous or similar therapy sessions. Employee may be required to undergo drug/alcohol screening tests at any time during the course of the counseling or rehabilitation program, and thereafter for up to five (5) years. If the County determines that an employee has failed to cooperate with rehabilitation under the terms of the County's policy, the employee will be suspended without pay, pending further investigation and final decision on disciplinary action. 
                  Time Off for Counseling/Rehabilitation - Work time lost will be paid according to eligibility for Vacation Leave. 
                  Effect of a Positive Test After Referral - After an employee has been referred for counseling or rehabilitation under the County's substance abuse program, the employee must promise to remain drug-free and/or alcohol-free as a condition of continued employment. A subsequent positive test will result in termination of employment.

                  C-11. - Notification of Convictions for Drug-Related Crimes and Sanctions. 
                  The Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act imposes special requirements upon the County and its employees at facilities where work is performed under one or more federal government grants. Any employee at such a facility who is convicted of any criminal drug offense committed on County property or while on County business must notify the County of the conviction within five (5) days of the conviction. Within ten (10) days of being so informed by the employee, the County will, as required by the above federal laws, notify each federal government agency with which it holds an applicable grant and advise that the conviction has occurred. Within thirty (30) days of being so informed by the employee, the County is required to take appropriate disciplinary action against the employee, up to and including termination.

                  SECTION D. - HIRING AND EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 

                  D-1. - Job Announcements. 
                  In general, job opening announcements will be posted in conspicuous public places and announced in appropriate public communications media, although the County reserves its discretionary right to not post a particular opening. Posting notices will typically include job title, department, location, job summary, essential duties, qualifications (required skills and abilities), and procedure to apply for the position. 
                  Every reasonable effort will be made to attract qualified applicants for available jobs, to include posting announcements in public places as well as publishing announcements in local newspapers or other media as needed. County employees are eligible to apply for a posted position, whether a promotion or transfer; the County may, at the discretion of the appointing authority, post a vacancy internally for existing employees prior to opening the position to the general public. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  D-2. - Applications for Employment. 
                  Applicants for positions with Mitchell County will be subject to a variety of processes associated with the hiring process. These will include a thorough and accurate completion of the County's employment application form, with applicant's signature. Employment screening activities such as interviews, job skills testing, personality assessments, background investigations, character references, or other methods may be utilized to assist in determining an applicant's qualifications for the position. 
                  County employees applying for a posted position, whether a promotion or transfer, must complete an application and will be screened, tested, and interviewed for the open position in the same manner prescribed for all applicants. Employees who are promoted are subject to a six-month probationary period. 
                  The County relies upon accuracy of information contained in the employment application, as well as accuracy of other data provided throughout the hiring process and employment. Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this information or data may result in the County's exclusion of the applicant from further consideration for employment or, if the person has been hired, termination of employment. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  D-3. - Appointments. 
                  Hiring Authority and Offers of Employment - The appointing authorities (the County Administrator or a Constitutional Officer) are the only County officials authorized to extend offers of employment, appoint employees, or outline conditions of employment; the appointing authorities may delegate this authority to subordinate managers at their discretion. All offers of employment must be in writing with the signature of the appointing authority or his/her designate. No statements by any county officials should be construed or interpreted to negate the "at will" status of County employees. 
                  Minimum Age of Employment - The minimum age for employment with the County is eighteen (18) for full-time positions and sixteen (16) for all other positions. 
                  The County recognizes two types of appointments that apply to both original appointments and promotions: Non-competitive appointments and competitive appointments. 
                  1.  Competitive Appointments - Competitive appointments are the normal practice of the County. When a vacancy occurs, a recruitment plan will be developed and implemented by the appointing authority. An applicant must be considered qualified for the job to be employed and, in general, the best qualified applicant will be employed. 
                  2.  Noncompetitive Appointments - At the County's discretion, the appointing authority may have cause to make appointments apart from or outside of the competitive recruitment process. These noncompetitive promotions shall be consistent with fair employment practices and generally constitute an emergency appointment of an individual to fill the position until such time as they become eligible for regular appointment or until a suitable, fully-qualified applicant becomes available. Noncompetitive appointments may be used in the following situations: 
                  •  When appointing an individual to serve in an acting or interim role; 
                  •  When filling temporary or special assignment positions; 
                  •  If no eligible applicants are available at such time as a critical vacancy occurs; 
                  Acting or Interim Appointments - The appointing authority may appoint an qualified individual (to include existing County employees) to fill a vacant supervisory or management position for a period not to exceed six (6) months in order to preserve the chain of command and accountability for departmental operations. Such appointments may also be made when it is believed that the County's interests are better served by extending the timeframe for competitive recruitment. Individuals appointed to a position on an interim or acting basis may apply for the posted position, however employee performance during the acting or interim appointment will be a factor in the consideration of the individual's application. The appointed individual will be assigned to an employment category described below, except that a current regular full-time employee may retain their employment status during the term of the appointment. Exceptions: This provision is not intended to apply to temporary assignments or "step-up" situations wherein an employee fills in for or is placed "in charge" during the temporary absence of his/her supervisor, but is not granted full authority as a supervisor. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  D-4. - Employment Categories. 
                  It is Mitchell County's intent to clarify the categories and classifications of employment so employees may understand their employment status and eligibility for benefits. 
                  FLSA Categories - Each position is designated as either NON-EXEMPT or EXEMPT from Federal and State wage and hour laws. These designations are determined based upon the position's responsibilities and according to guidelines of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). A change in the exempt or non-exempt status of a position may only occur as a result of changes in position responsibilities, and only upon written notification by County management. Employees in non-exempt positions are entitled to overtime pay under the specific provisions of Federal and State laws. Employees in exempt positions are excluded from specific provisions of Federal and State wage and hour laws. 
                  Position Classifications - In addition to the above categories, each position in the County's Position Classification and Pay Plan will be designated to one of the classes listed below: 
                  •  Regular Full-Time employees are those who: (a) have completed the Probation period of employment; (b) are regularly scheduled to work the County's full-time schedule (a minimum of 37.5 hours per week); and (c) are not assigned to a Temporary status. Regular full-time employees are eligible for the County's benefit package, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program. Note: This is not intended to include employees hired in part-time positions but that occasionally work more than 37.5 hours per week. 
                  •  Regular Part-time employees are those who: (a) have completed the Probation period of employment; (b) are regularly scheduled to work less than the full-time work schedule (i.e. less than 37.5 hours per week); and (c) are not assigned to a Temporary status. Regular part-time employees receive all legally mandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security), but they are ineligible for the County's other benefit programs. 
                  •  Employees in the Probation Period are those who have not completed their Probation period of employment (usually six months in the position) and/or whose performance is being evaluated to determine whether further employment in a specific position or with the County is appropriate. Upon completion of the Probation period, and after a successful performance review and recommendation by the department head, this employee will typically attain regular status. Eligibility for benefits during the Probation period will generally depend on the full-time or part-time nature of the position, and will be subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program. 
                  •  Temporary employees are those who: (a) are hired for assignments of limited duration (usually no more than six months); (b) are hired as acting or interim replacements; or (c) are hired to temporarily supplement the work force on a seasonal basis or to assist in completion of a specific project. Employment beyond any initially stated period does not in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees may work a full-time or part-time schedule. Temporary employees retain the temporary status unless and until notified of a change. While temporary employees receive all legally mandated benefits (such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security), they are ineligible for the County's other benefit programs. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  D-5. - Probationary Period. 
                  The first six (6) months of employment in a position of original appointment, promotion, or transfer to a position that has different qualifications shall be a Probationary Period; furthermore, an employee will remain in probation period until any required state certifications are obtained. This will be a period for training, evaluation, and observation to monitor performance and obtain the most effective adjustment of the new or promoted employee. During this period the employee has no right to expect continued employment in that position and employment can be terminated at any time with or without reason and without the right of appeal. 
                  A probationary employee can normally expect to receive regular feedback regarding their performance during and at the end of the probation period (preferably in the form of a written performance evaluation). Upon the basis of a successful review and recommendation by the department head, the employee will attain regular status. If an employee is promoted and is deemed to be unsatisfactory in the new job, the employee shall be given the opportunity to return to his/her previous position or a similar position if there is a vacancy.

                  D-6. - Transfers. 
                  A transfer is the movement of an employee from one position to another position with a different job title, but at the same pay grade and a similar level of responsibility. A transfer can be initiated by an employee or by the County. If a position is open at an equivalent pay grade, an employee may request transfer to that position. If the knowledge, skill, and abilities required for that job are not the same as for the present job, the employee will be tested and interviewed for the new position, and if transferred will be in a probationary period for the new job. The County Administrator may transfer an employee to any position, at any pay grade, if the employee is qualified to do the work and if their salary is not changed. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  D-7. - Promotions. 
                  A promotion is the movement of an employee from one position to another position with a different job title, a higher pay grade, and a higher level of responsibility. It will be the policy of the County to promote from within when possible, providing that such promotions are consistent with nondiscrimination laws and fair employment practices. 
                  Candidates for promotion must complete an application and will be screened, tested, and interviewed for the open position in the same manner prescribed for all applicants. Employees who are promoted are subject to a six-month probationary period. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  D-8. - Demotions. 
                  A demotion is the movement of an employee from one position to another position with a different job title, a lower pay grade, and a lower level of responsibility. A demotion may be made as a disciplinary action or on a voluntary or involuntary basis, provided the employee meets the qualifications for the position to which the employee is being demoted. An employee serving a probation period may be demoted for any reason or without reason. An employee serving a promotional probation period may be demoted to their previous position for any reason or without reason. Any employee may request a demotion for personal or other reasons; such action will constitute a voluntary demotion. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  D-9. - Separations. 
                  The following are reasons by which employees will be separated from their employment with the County: 
                  •  Voluntary Resignation - A resignation is the voluntary separation of an employee from employment with the County through submittal of a notice that they wish to resign the position. To resign in good standing, an employee should submit notice of resignation at least two (2) weeks in advance of the date of resignation (a minimum of 30 days is required for employees in management positions). This notice should be submitted in writing to the appointing authority. Failure to comply with this guideline will be entered as such in the personnel records, and may negatively impact the employee's eligibility for re-employment. The County may exempt an employee who has given less than required notice if, in their judgment, exceptional circumstances warrant such exemption. Also, under certain circumstances, the appointing authority may choose not to accept an employee's resignation, and may instead choose to dismiss the employee. 
                  •  Job Abandonment - Employees who are absent from work for three (3) or more consecutive work days without having received leave approval or without having called in to report the absence will be considered as having voluntarily abandoned their jobs without proper notice. The separation will be considered "not be in good standing" and may affect the receipt of accrued benefits. The effective date of termination of an employee due to job abandonment will be the last day the employee worked. Such an employee is normally not eligible for re-employment. 
                  •  Lay-off (Reduction in Force) - A Lay-off is a reduction in force that results in the separation of one or more employees due to circumstances beyond the control of the employer or the employee, such as abolishment of a position or group of positions, a shortage of funds or work, a need to increase efficiency, or a material change in the duties or organizational unit of a department. A lay-off does not reflect discredit upon the service of the employee(s), and separations will be made in accordance with the needs and priorities of the County. Employees released due to a reduction in force will have no right to grieve their release, however the employee may be offered a transfer to a job of equal or lower grade, if the job is available and the employee is qualified, and employees separated due to reduction-in-force may receive preference in rehiring if a position for which they are qualified should open within one year. The duties previously performed by a laid-off employee may be reassigned to other employees holding positions in appropriate classes. 
                  •  Dismissal - A dismissal is the involuntary termination of employment with cause. An employee may be dismissed for committing any act contrary to County policies or for failure to demonstrate competent and consistent performance of duties. Although progressive discipline procedures will generally be followed, progressive discipline will not be applied for situations which justify immediate termination of employment. The County reserves the right to omit one or more progressive steps depending on the situation and the facts involved, and to exercise appropriate actions on a case-by-case basis. Employees who are dismissed, or terminated for just cause, are not eligible for rehire. 
                  •  Separation During Probation Period - At any time during a probation period, an employee may be separated from their position by the County, without notice, and without the right of appeal or hearing. 
                  •  Retirement - An employee may voluntarily separate from employment with the County when he/she has met the requirements governing retirement. Any employee wishing to retire is expected to provide a minimum of two (2) weeks notice whenever reasonably possible (30 days for employees in management positions). Employees leaving due to retirement are typically considered to have separated employment in good standing. 
                  •  Disability - An employee may be dismissed if he/she cannot perform the essential duties of the job with reasonable accommodation and there is no available vacancy for which the employee is qualified and with duties which he/she can perform with reasonable accommodation. Separation action will only be taken after all accrued leaves with pay have been extended, and will be always taken by the end of one year from the date the employee last reported for work. 
                  •  Death - In the event of the death of an employee, separation will be considered effective as of the date of death. Compensation due as of that date will be paid to the designated beneficiary, except as otherwise required by law. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  D-10. - Position Classification and Pay Plan. 
                  The County may adopt and revise an employee Classification and Compensation Plan (Pay Plan) for all positions under the County's personnel policies and procedures. The nature and content of such Plan will be at the discretion of the Board of Commissioners, and is subject to change or discontinuation at any time without prior notice to employees. The following principles will govern the design, implementation, and administration of the pay plan: 
                  •  Internal Equity - Positions covered by the plan will be classified and placed into a pay grade in accordance with the complexity, level of responsibility, degree of supervision required and exercised, required training and experience, and other compensable factors identified by the County or its representative as pertinent to the overall value of the position to the organization. A valid and reliable job evaluation system will be used to measure relative worth and establish internal equity. 
                  •  Job Descriptions - Job descriptions may be included in the County's Pay Plan. Such job descriptions are descriptive and not restrictive. They are intended to indicate the general kinds of duties, responsibilities, and job requirements normally associated with the position, but are not intended to be exhaustive. The job descriptions include "minimum qualifications" (statements of the minimum background determined to be required as evidence of ability to properly perform the work"). Employees may be assigned other duties not included in the descriptions, and may also be required to work across departmental lines. Each employee will be provided with a copy of his/her current job description if available. 
                  •  External Equity - The pay plan will provide a schedule of pay ranges for all positions, with consideration given to rates of pay for comparable services in the County's competitive market (which may include other public and private employment), costs-of-living, other benefits received by employees, the County's financial condition and policies, and other relevant factors. 
                  •  Pay Ranges - Pay ranges will constitute the official compensation schedule for all positions covered by the pay plan, and establish the minimum and maximum allowable salaries allowable for any given position. The entry salary of any employee will normally be at the minimum of the salary range for the position to which they are appointed; exceptions may be made at the discretion of the Board of Commissioners when: (1) it is not possible to recruit qualified employees at the entry level; (2) an employee is being considered for employment who possesses qualifications in excess of the minimum required for appointment to the position, and when those advanced qualifications will serve to make them a more valuable and productive employee; or (3) circumstances exist that, in the opinion of an appointing authority, warrant payment of a salary in excess of the minimum for the position. 
                  •  Maintenance and Update of the Pay Plan - At the discretion of the Board of Commissioners, the pay plan will be maintained in such a manner and on an as-needed basis as to maintain internal equity and to ensure the competitive integrity of the pay plan. The County may revise the classification or pay grade of any position, adjust the pay ranges, revise any job description, add new or eliminate existing classifications, or make other changes necessary to reflect new or changed operations, work conditions, or requirements. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  D-11. - Salary Adjustments. 
                  The County intends to hire employees at a rate that is competitive with what other comparable employers would pay for similar skills in the County's competitive market. Wage increases are not automatic. An employee may receive a wage increase based upon the tasks performed and the manner in which they perform these tasks. Budgetary considerations or marginal performance by an employee may result in little or no salary increase. Salary adjustments may be made in the following situations: 
                  •  Adoption of New Pay Plan or Salary Scale - When a new pay plan is adopted or substantial changes are made to the pay ranges of the existing plan, the Board of Commissioners may adopt an implementation schedule that places employees into the plan in a manner that is fair, equitable, and financially feasible. Under the implementation, individual employee salaries may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged, provided however that all salaries must be within the minimum and maximum allowable salaries allowable for any given position. 
                  •  Across-the-Board Increases - The Board of Commissioners may approve an across the board increase (sometimes referred to as a cost-of-living increase) for all employees; such increases are typically granted in a uniform manner (e.g. consistent percentage or step increase) and may correspond to adjustments to the pay ranges. 
                  •  Performance (Merit) Increases - The Board of Commissioners may, at their discretion, fund and approve a schedule that provides performance (aka. "merit") increases for employees in accordance with their performance and overall contribution to the organization. 
                  •  Special Circumstances - In special, unique, or unusual circumstances, the County Administrator or Constitutional Officer may request the Board of Commissioners to authorize adjustment of an employee's salary in order to address inequities, discrimination or discrepancies in pay, special assignments, exceptional performance related to successful completion of significant projects, or emergency or special situations critical to the operations of county government. Such increases are at the discretion of the Board and subject to the availability of funds; increases under this category are intended to be rare. 
                  •  Promotion - Upon promotion to a new or existing position, an employee's salary will be increased to the minimum of the pay grade for the new position if necessary. 
                  •  Acting or Interim Appointment - Existing County employees that are appointed to serve in an acting or interim position will receive a salary increase in accordance with the provisions described above under "Promotion." 
                  •  Transfer - An employee's salary will remain unchanged unless the circumstances of the transfer meet the conditions described above under "Special Circumstances" (e.g. an employee is given an incentive to transfer to another position to address emergency or special situations critical to the operations of county government). 
                  •  Reclassification of Position - Upon position reclassification, an employee's salary will remain unchanged unless an increase is necessary to bring the employee up to the minimum of the new pay range or unless the circumstances of the reclassification meet the conditions described above under "Special Circumstances" (e.g. a position is reclassified to address emergency or special situations critical to the operations of county government). 
                  •  Demotion - Upon demotion to a new or existing position, an employee's salary will be decreased by a minimum of 10% increase, but keeping within the minimum and maximum allowable pay for the new position. 
                  •  Disciplinary Salary Reductions - When subject to a disciplinary salary reduction, an employee's salary will be decreased by a minimum of 10% increase; disciplinary salary reductions may result in a rate of pay that drops below the minimum of pay range for the position held by the employee. 
                  SECTION E. - PERFORMANCE AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS 

                  E-1. - Performance Appraisal. 
                  Mitchell County may utilize a performance appraisal system to evaluate performance of individual employees. The type of system utilized is at the discretion of the County, and is subject to change without prior notice. 
                  The purpose of performance appraisal is primarily to assess how well employees are performing their work and how they can improve work performance; performance evaluation provides an opportunity for the supervisor and employee to discuss job tasks, comment on performance (both positively and negatively), identify and correct weaknesses, recognize and encourage strengths, establish standards for the next review process, and discuss approaches for meeting goals. Each employee's performance will be evaluated on a continuing basis throughout employment. More formal evaluations may be performed in conjunction with the employee's probationary period, or at periodic intervals (such as on an annual basis). Performance evaluations are not a right of the employee nor an obligation of the County; rather, they are a management tool to be used at the County's discretion. Evaluations may also be used as a basis for merit raises, training, promotion, demotion, transfer, dismissal, or other purposes. 
                  If written performance appraisals are utilized, the employee is requested to sign the evaluation form. This signature verifies only that the evaluation has been discussed with the employee, and does not indicate the employee's agreement or disagreement with the performance rating. If an employee refuses to acknowledge by signature their receipt of the evaluation form, a note by the department head or County Administrator describing the refusal will be placed in the employee's personnel file. If an employee disagrees with any statement in an evaluation, they may submit a written statement to the department head and/or County Administrator within ten (10) days following the evaluation. The written statement will become part of the employee's permanent file. This action does not constitute a grievance or appeal; it is merely an administrative procedure requiring no action or response by County management or any of its designees. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  E-2. - Disciplinary Actions. 
                  In order for the County to function effectively toward accomplishment of objectives, it is essential that all employees conduct themselves in a manner that promotes attainment of these objectives. The County seeks to resolve performance and conduct problems in the most positive and constructive manner possible. Accordingly, the County has established general guidelines of unacceptable behaviors (listed below under 'Causes for Disciplinary Actions'), and measures that may be taken to correct those behaviors. Whenever possible, the County will provide employees with an opportunity to correct problematic behavior or poor performance. An employee who fails to adequately perform assigned duties or who violates established policies will be disciplined in accordance with the policies and procedures outlined herein. 
                  The County advocates progressive discipline—a process in which disciplinary action is taken in degrees of increasing severity—when appropriate. The mechanisms for progressive discipline may include verbal reprimand, written reprimand, suspension without pay, salary reduction, demotion, or dismissal. The action taken will depend on the degree and the circumstances of the violation. 
                  The use of progressive discipline shall be discretionary. While this policy sets forth six available steps for discipline, certain steps may be skipped in a disciplinary process, depending upon the nature of the employee's misconduct, poor performance, probationary status, and/or length of employment. Some misconduct or actions may result in the immediate termination of an employee. Further, this Policy should not be construed to require six incidents of misconduct or poor performance before dismissal is considered an appropriate sanction. If an employee engages in different types of misconduct or poor performance, each incident can provoke increased discipline, even if the incidents of misconduct or poor performance are in different areas or unrelated to other previous incidents. Moreover, other forms of discipline not detailed in this policy may be utilized in the discretion of the County Administrator. 
                  Exceptions to Discipline Procedures - Occasions may occur when an employee must be immediately removed from the job. This may include a situation where it is likely the employee has committed a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude, or when the employee's continued presence on the job might be dangerous for him or others or be unduly disruptive to operations. In such an instance, the employee should be immediately removed from the job by the department head. 
                  Causes for Disciplinary Actions - As an "at-will" employer, Mitchell County is not required to give causes of disciplinary action either in these policies nor at the time of an adverse personnel action, nor is the County required to dismiss only for any so-called "just cause". However, County officials feel that effective communications can enhance the efficiency and morale of the organization. 
                  The following list of possible causes for disciplinary actions is intended to represent general reasons that are universally accepted as causes in public sector employers. These reasons are neither mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive. The County may discipline for any combination of reasons, for reasons not listed below, or for reasons not specified, at any time, as long as the employee's constitutional protected liberty interests are not violated. These possible causes for disciplinary action include: 
                  1.  Chronic or excessive tardiness, absenteeism, or wasted time and/or loitering during working hours; 
                  2.  Negligence in performing assigned duties; or carelessness or negligence with County monies or other property; 
                  3.  Failure to do work at an acceptable level of competence or inability or unfitness to perform assigned duties; 
                  4.  Insubordination, disrespect, discourteous treatment, or an uncooperative attitude, whether to a supervisor, co-worker, or member of the public; 
                  5.  Conduct reflecting discredit on the County or the department to which assigned; 
                  6.  Misconduct or violation of County standards of conduct, drug-free workplace, or County driving policies; 
                  7.  Commission of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude; 
                  8.  Failure to report to work without justifiable cause; 
                  9.  Dishonesty or willfully giving false statements of any kind to supervisors, officials, or the public; 
                  10.  Falsification or destruction of official records or documents; 
                  11.  Use of official position for personal benefit, profit, or advantage, to include acceptance of gifts and gratuities; 
                  12.  Political activity which is prohibited by these policies; 
                  13.  Violation of or refusal to comply with federal, state, or local laws or regulations; 
                  14.  Violation of County ordinances, administrative regulations, provisions of this Handbook, departmental rules or procedures, or any other justifiable reason for discipline. 
                  Initiation of Disciplinary Action - When an alleged infraction of a work rule occurs, the supervisor will investigate the circumstances of the alleged infraction in a timely manner in order to establish the facts and to identify the offending individuals. This investigation should include discussion with the suspected offender and any witnesses; the alleged offender should be given an opportunity to respond to the complaint. All information gathered should be systematically documented and recorded. If it is determined that there is sufficient reason for disciplinary action against an employee, action should be taken in accordance with the principles of progressive discipline. 
                  Types of Disciplinary Actions - Disciplinary actions fall into two general categories, reprimands and adverse actions (numbered below in order of the six progressive disciplinary steps). 
                  •  Reprimands - A reprimand is a formal means of communicating to the employee a warning that a problem exists and that it must be corrected. There are two degrees of formality, an oral reprimand and a written reprimand. 
                  1.  Oral Reprimand - In an oral reprimand, the supervisor or department head will verbally and privately explain to the employee that he or she is being reprimanded and describe the problem and what must be done to correct the problem. 
                  2.  Written Reprimand - In a written reprimand, the employee will receive a written statement describing the problem and what must be done to correct it. The reprimand will also contain a statement describing the probable consequences of not correcting the problem. The written statement will be given to the employee during a private interview. 
                  •  Adverse Action - An adverse action is an action taken for any reason by the Appointing Authority or his designee that results in a disciplinary suspension without pay, disciplinary salary reduction, disciplinary demotion, or dismissal. 
                  3.  Suspension Without Pay - An employee may be suspended without pay by the County. The suspension without pay shall not exceed thirty days (unless the outcome is partially dependent on a court decision or law enforcement investigation, in which case the suspension should be indefinite pending resolution). 
                  4.  Disciplinary Salary Reduction - An employee's salary may be reduced from one pay step to a lower step for disciplinary reasons. The salary reduction does not constitute a demotion in pay grade. 
                  5.  Disciplinary Demotion - An employee may be demoted from one pay grade to a lower pay grade for disciplinary reasons if a lower position is open and if the employee is qualified to perform the work at the lower position. A disciplinary demotion includes a decrease in salary. 
                  6.  Dismissal - An employee may be dismissed for disciplinary reasons when all other alternatives have failed to solve the problem or, in the County's judgment, it is necessary to remove the employee from the work place immediately and/or permanently. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  E-3. - Notification of Disciplinary Actions and Employee Response. 
                  Although not required by law to provide employees with reasons or causes for an adverse action, the County may, at its discretion, give the employee a notification of the proposed adverse action five (5) days prior to the effective date of the action. No notification will be given for oral or written reprimands. 
                  The employee response procedure is created to protect the employee from erroneous or arbitrary disciplinary action, as well as to afford the department an opportunity to re-evaluate its position on proposed disciplinary actions and to affirm or correct if necessary. The procedure does not require a full hearing prior to the disciplinary action; it requires only that the employee be given an opportunity to respond to the charges in writing. 
                  Such notification may contain the following: 
                  1.  The effective date of the proposed action. 
                  2.  The specific charges or reasons for the action. 
                  3.  A statement informing the employee that they may respond to a named official both orally and in writing within three (3) working days of receiving the notice of proposed adverse action. 
                  4.  A warning that failure to respond to the named official will result in waiver of all further appeal rights. 
                  An employee may respond in person or in writing to the named official within three (3) working days of receiving the notice of proposed adverse action. Failure to respond to the notice within three (3) working days will result in a waiver of all appeals. 
                  After considering the employee's response, the named official may reinvestigate the circumstances and take the following actions: (1) uphold the decision to administer disciplinary action; (2) reduce or increase the severity of the disciplinary action; or (3) reverse the recommendation and take no further disciplinary action. The named official may give a written notice of their decision on action to be taken within two (2) days of the effective date of the proposed action. The notice will include a statement outlining any appeal options open to the employee. (The official may postpone the deadline for their response by a specific number of days to conduct further investigation. If the deadline for response is postponed, the effective date of the proposed action as contained in the notice of proposed action should be postponed by as many days.) 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  E-4. - Grievances and Appeals. 
                  Purpose and Intent - The purpose of the employee grievance procedure is to provide an orderly process for hearing the grievable claims of employees. The object of the process is to reach a fair and equitable decision in a timely manner. The employee and supervisor should make an effort to resolve any grievance informally before initiating a formal grievance. 
                  Employees shall not be penalized for proper use of the grievance procedure. However, it is not proper to abuse the procedure by submitting grievances in bad faith or solely for the purposes of delay or harassment, or by repeatedly submitting grievances that a reasonable person would judge to have no merit. Initiation of the grievance procedure by an employee does not limit the right of the County to proceed with any disciplinary action that is not in retaliation for the use of the grievance procedures. 
                  Grievances are to be fully processed until the employee is satisfied, does not file a timely appeal, or exhausts the right of appeal. A decision becomes binding on all parties whenever any employee does not file a timely appeal or when a decision is made in the final step and the right to appeal no longer exists. 
                  Grievances - A grievance is defined as a claim initiated by an employee alleging that the County has: 
                  1.  Unfairly or unlawfully disciplined them in an adverse action which includes suspension without pay, demotion, or dismissal; or 
                  2.  Unlawfully discriminated against them in any other manner; or 
                  3.  Unlawfully deprived them of their liberty interest under the Constitution in a manner other than through an adverse action; or 
                  4.  Applied unlawful or unjust coercion or reprisal to the employee; or 
                  5.  Applied County or departmental policies to the employee in an arbitrary or capricious manner; or 
                  6.  Provided unsafe or unhealthy working conditions; or 
                  7.  Applied other unlawful or unjust practices that adversely affect the employee. 
                  Non-Grievable Areas - The following issues are not grievable: 
                  1.  Issues which are pending or have been concluded by other administrative or judicial procedures; 
                  2.  Work assignments which do not result in a demotion or a salary reduction; 
                  3.  Budget allocations and expenditures, and organizational structure, including the persons or number of persons assigned to particular jobs or units, including a layoff which results from a reduction in force; 
                  4.  The content or rating of a performance appraisal, except when the employee can show that he or she has been adversely affected by the appraisal; 
                  5.  The selection of an individual by the appointing authority to fill a position through appointment, promotion, or transfer, except when the employee can show that he or she has been adversely affected because of unlawful discrimination; 
                  6.  Any matter which is not within the jurisdiction or control of the appointing authority; 
                  7.  Internal security practices established by the appointing authority or Board of Commissioners; 
                  8.  Decisions, policies, practices, resolutions, or ordinances made or passed by the Board of Commissioners which are not job-related or work-related and do not contradict these policies. 
                  Grievance Procedures - Employees must notify the County in a timely fashion of any grievance considered appropriate for handling under this policy. The grievance procedure is the exclusive remedy for employees to challenge adverse employment action. As used in this policy, the terms "timely fashion," "reasonable time," and "promptly" will mean within five (5) working days. Employees who feel they have an appropriate grievance should proceed as follows: 
                  1.  The employee submits a written grievance to the appointing authority (County Administrator or Constitutional Officer) within five (5) business days of the action or event in question or decision from Step Two. The grievance must contain all pertinent information to be considered and should be submitted on a form (if available) specified by the County. 
                  2.  The appointing authority will meet with the grievant within ten (10) business days and allow the grievant to present their complaint and requested resolution. The grievant will represent him/herself in this meeting, and the appointing authority may question the grievant and any witnesses brought to the meeting by the grievant. 
                  3.  The appointing authority will then investigate the grievance, attempt to resolve it, and give a decision to the employee within five (5) business days of the meeting in Step 2. The appointing authority should prepare a written, dated summary of the grievance and the proposed resolution for the file. The appointing authority may extend the deadlines if necessary, provided that a final decision is issued to the employee within 30 days from the receipt of the written grievance. The decision of the appointing authority is final and binding. The matter is resolved if the employee is satisfied with the decision or if the employee fails to appeal the decision within ten (10) business days. 
                  Final decisions on grievances will not be precedent-setting or binding on future grievances unless they are officially stated as County policy. When appropriate, decisions will be retroactive to the date of the employee's original grievance. 
                  Conflicts of Interest: The County Administrator or Constitutional Officer may, at their own discretion and in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, recuse themselves from Step Three by either: (1) asking another appointing authority to substitute and act on their behalf for this matter; or (2) forwarding the grievance to the Hearing Officer to proceed as outlined under "Appeals." 
                  Appeals - The purpose of an appeal is to provide a formal review of an action or decision made by the appointing authority, and to provide due process for employees with a property interest in their job or who claim that a constitutionally protected right has been violated. An appeal hearing is intended to be structured but less formal than a court hearing; appeals should be interpreted as an exercise of judicial power, rather they are a voluntary compliance of forms of judicial procedure. All avenues of the grievance process must be exhausted before an appeal can be filed. 
                  All appeals will be held by a Hearing Officer to be designated by the County. In general, a hearing officer should be an attorney, mediator, or human resources professional with substantial experience in the matters of personnel law. A list of potential Hearing Officers should be maintained by the County Administrator and approved by the Board of Commissioners to be called upon as needed. 
                  Appeals Procedure - Upon notification of the appointing authority's decision in a grievable action, the employee may submit a written appeal to the County Administrator no later than ten (10) days from the date of notification. The County Administrator will schedule a formal hearing with the Hearing Officer as quickly as is feasible, but not to exceed thirty (30) days from the submission date of the appeal. Both the grievant and the appointing authority may represent themselves or have an attorney present at their own expense. The Hearing Officer should compile evidence, prepare findings of fact and conclusions of law, and issue a final recommendation to the appointing authority regarding any actions necessary to resolve the appeal. 
                  Confidentiality - Information concerning any employee grievance is to be held in strict confidence. Employees, supervisors, and any members of management involved in grievance investigations are to discuss details only with those individuals who have a need to know or who are needed to supply necessary background information. The Appeals hearings shall be open to the public, unless the County and the employee mutually agree otherwise. 
                  Compensation - Time spent by employees in grievance discussions with management during their normal working hours will be considered as time worked for pay purposes. 
                  Employment Pending Procedure - Nothing contained herein shall in any way require the County to delay any disciplinary action, demotion, or termination pending final resolution of a grievance. The filing of a grievance or appeal shall not delay the effective date of an employee's demotion, termination, or other adverse action and the County shall have no obligation to place an employee who faces a grievance or appeal on leave (with or without pay). The County Administrator may, at his/her sole discretion, delay adverse action pending the grievance or may make such other interim provision as they deem appropriate.

                  SECTION F. - ATTENDANCE AND PAYROLL 

                  F-1. - Hours of Work, Overtime, and Compensatory Time. 
                  Hours of Work - Hours of work and shift assignments vary for each department, based on services provided by the department and staffing requirements to provide those services. Each department manager will establish employee work schedules in accordance with the needs of the County and of the employees concerned (subject to approval of the appointing authority). Employees are required to work the hours assigned. The actual work schedule is dependent on specific job functions, and operational needs may require deviations from the normal schedule. If an assigned schedule is changed, the change will be communicated to all affected employees. 
                  Work Week - The minimum work week for full-time, covered employees will be forty (40) hours per week. Due to the difference in job requirements in various departments, the required work period may vary from job to job, and from department to department. 
                  Overtime - Overtime work may be necessary from time to time, depending on departmental workload. All overtime must be authorized in advance by the department head, and all efforts should be made by department heads to minimize overtime through efficient scheduling. 
                  •  Non-Exempt (Hourly) Employees - Overtime compensation is paid to non-exempt employees in accordance with Federal and State wage and hour restrictions. Overtime pay is based on actual hours worked — time off for holidays, sick leave, vacation, or other non-worked time will not be considered hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime payments. Actual hours of training time (approved in advance by the County Administrator) can be included in worked time for calculation of overtime. 
                  Non-exempt employees whose work period is one week will be paid at the rate of one and one-half the normal rate for hours actually worked over forty (40) per week. Different work periods may apply to Public Safety departments, with employees paid overtime for hours worked above the designated number of hours in the work period. All overtime must be reported in the pay period in which it is worked. 
                  •  Exempt (Salaried) Employees - Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime, and will receive their normal salary, regardless of hours worked. It is expected however, that such employees will work a regular schedule of at least forty (40) hours per week. 
                  Compensatory Time - A non-exempt employee may be granted compensatory time off by a department head in lieu of overtime pay if: (a) the employee agrees in writing, and (b) the employee is granted compensatory time at one and one-half hour for each extra hour worked. In all cases, the employee must report all worked time, and the supervisor/department head is responsible for accurately maintaining records of accrued time and use of compensatory time. Exempt employees are not eligible for compensatory time off. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  F-2. - Breaks. 
                  Breaks are designed to provide a periodic rest period for the employee during the work shift, independent of the longer meal breaks. A break schedule will be developed within each department, taking into consideration the department's operational and coverage needs. Breaks are contingent upon workload and coverage, and may not be provided in times of heavy workload or insufficient coverage at the discretion of the supervisor. Breaks may not be "saved" or lumped together. If an employee misses a scheduled break, the break is considered lost. 
                  The schedule of most full-time employees provides a meal break that is on the employee's time and is not compensated by the County. Meal breaks should be taken on a staggered schedule in order to provide appropriate coverage. A meal break schedule will be developed within each department, subject to change based on the department's workload and coverage. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  F-3. - Attendance and Tardiness. 
                  The County is responsible for providing dependable services to the community. This places an obligation on all employees to be on the job and on time every scheduled workday. When employees are absent, their workload falls behind schedule or other employees must assume heavier workloads. For this reason, perfect attendance is desired. 
                  Employees are expected to report to work as scheduled, on time and prepared to start work. Employees also are expected to remain at work for their entire work schedule. Late arrival, early departure, or other absences from scheduled hours are disruptive and must be avoided. Any pattern of frequent absence, tardiness, or early departure may result in disciplinary action, which could result in termination of employment. 
                  Absences - The County recognizes that there are instances when absences are unavoidable. An absence is considered acceptable if it is reported promptly and if the reason for the absence is appropriate. An absence is considered unacceptable whenever proper notification of the absence is not given, or where the reason for the absence is, itself, unacceptable. The following are procedures for proper notification of absence: 
                  •  An employee who is unable to report to work must personally notify his/her supervisor prior to the scheduled work time. Notice must be given as far in advance of the scheduled work time as possible, and no later than within one (1) hour after the scheduled start time. 
                  •  If it is not possible for the employee to personally talk to the supervisor, the employee should (a) have someone else make the notification, and (b) personally call and discuss the situation with the supervisor as soon as circumstances permit. 
                  •  An employee absent due to illness should advise his/her supervisor on a daily basis of the employee's status and estimated date-of-return. 
                  Tardiness (including Early Departures and Extended Breaks) - It is important to arrive to work on time, to promptly take and return from breaks, and to leave work on schedule. Employees who cannot report to work on time should notify their supervisor no later than 30 minutes after the assigned start time. This notification does not excuse the tardiness but simply notifies the supervisor that a schedule change may be necessary. An employee's request to leave work early or take an extended break may be considered by the supervisor. Approval of such absences should be based upon the urgency of the reason for the absence as well as department staffing needs. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  F-4. - Payroll Information. 
                  Paychecks - Paychecks are issued each pay period on a regularly scheduled basis. There are no advances in pay. The payroll office will deduct from employee earnings only those deductions required by law (such as social security and withholding taxes) plus any employee-authorized contributions (such as premiums for insurance benefits or retirement contributions). Court-ordered deductions such as wage garnishments or child support payments will be deducted in accordance with the appropriate court order. 
                  Time Records - Employees are required to maintain accurate time records using equipment and/or forms provided by the County. In compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, non-exempt employees will be paid for all hours worked. Non-exempt employees must record their arrival/departure times, meal breaks, and hours worked. They may not 'clock in" before the time they are expected to start work, and may not delay their "clock-out" time when work hours are completed. In addition, non-exempt employees are prohibited from performing any "off-the-clock" work (meaning work performed but not reported on the timesheet). 
                  Supervisors must ensure that time records are properly maintained and are accurate upon submission for payment. All wage and hour records are subject to audit by the U.S. Department of Labor. 
                  Reporting Discrepancies - It is the County's policy and practice to compensate employees accurately and in compliance with all applicable laws. The County takes all reasonable steps to ensure that employees are paid promptly on the scheduled payday, and that employees receive the correct amount of pay in each paycheck. In the unlikely event that an error in amount of pay should occur, the employee should promptly bring the discrepancy to the attention of his/her supervisor or manager for the error to be researched and corrected. 
                  It is a violation of County policy for any employee to falsify a timesheet or to alter another employee's timesheet. It is also a serious violation of policy for any employee or manager to instruct another employee to incorrectly or falsely report hours worked or alter another employee's timesheet to under- or over-report hours worked. Any employee who is instructed to incorrectly or falsely under- or over-report hours worked, or instructed to alter another employee's timesheet records to inaccurately or falsely report that employee's hours worked, should report it immediately to their supervisor, their department head, the payroll office, or the County Administrator. Every report will be fully investigated and corrective action taken where appropriate, up to and including discharge for any employee violating this policy. In addition, the County will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report alleged violations of this policy or who cooperate in the County's investigation of such reports. 
                  Changes in Personnel Information - Each employee is responsible for promptly notifying their department head of any changes in their personal data, including changes in name, address, telephone number, marital status, dependent data, emergency contacts, educational accomplishments, or other information pertinent to their employment, benefits, or payroll actions. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  F-5. - Personnel Records. 
                  Mitchell County maintains personnel files on each employee. These files include information such as the employee's job application, resume, training records, performance evaluations, documentation of personnel actions (e.g., salary changes, transfers, promotions, or terminations), benefit enrollment forms, and other employment-related records. Personnel files will not include records relating to investigation of a possible criminal offense, or of documents which are being developed or prepared for use in civil, criminal, or grievance procedures. A separate personnel file is maintained for physical examination records, insurance claim forms, or other records of employee illnesses and injuries; access to such files is restricted to protect the employee's medical information. All personnel records will be maintained in accordance with applicable legal requirements and regulatory guidelines. 
                  Public Inspection - Personnel files are the property of Mitchell County Government, and access to the information they contain is restricted. Generally, only management and supervisory personnel who have a legitimate reason to review information in a file are allowed to do so. However, information relating to employees and former employees may be available for public inspection at reasonable times and in accordance with Title 50, Chapter 18, Official Code of Georgia Annotated. Employees who wish to review their personnel file should contact the Personnel Office; with reasonable advance notice, employees may review their own personnel file in County offices and in the presence of an individual appointed by the County. 
                  Confidentiality of Records - Any disclosure of personnel record information to unauthorized persons will require the written authorization of the employee. However, the County will have the right to disclose any such information in the course of an appeal of a disciplinary action initiated by the employee.

                  F-6. - Requests for References. 
                  The County Administrator's office is responsible for responding to any inquiries regarding personnel records, employment verification, or employment/credit references on present or previous employees. As a matter of policy, any response to requests for references must be limited to factual information that can be substantiated by County records. Any County employee receiving such a request should forward the request to the Human Resources office for response.

                  SECTION G. - LEAVE PROCEDURES 

                  G-1. - Types of Leave. 
                  Mitchell County recognizes several types of leave that are available to employees. The nature of the leave determines whether a leave will be paid or unpaid. Leave options include: 
                  •  Annual Leave 
                  •  Sick Leave 
                  •  Funeral Leave 
                  •  Military Leave 
                  •  Court Leave 
                  •  Family and Medical Leave (FMLA) 
                  Leave Benefits: Except where required by law (military leave, FMLA, jury duty, etc.), leave is a benefit provided to employees by the County and constitutes a significant portion of the benefits package offered to eligible employees. Except as outlined herein, there is no entitlement or expectation for leave, and the provisions of these benefits may be changed by the County at any time. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  G-2. - General Guidelines Governing Leave. 
                  Employee Responsibilities During Leave - Any employee applying for leave under a specific leave provision must comply with the following: 
                  a)  Must follow appropriate procedures to request a leave and to return from a leave; 
                  b)  Must communicate regularly with the supervisor regarding the status of their leave; 
                  c)  Must submit any required documentation related to their absence or their return to work; 
                  d)  Must maintain required payments for any insurance benefits to be continued during the leave. 
                  Payment of Leave Benefits - Paid leave benefits are paid at the employee's base hourly rate of pay at the time of the paid leave. The pay rate does not include overtime or any special form of compensation such as shift differentials, incentives, commissions, or bonuses. 
                  Benefits During Paid Leave - During the paid portion of any leave, benefits such as sick leave, annual leave, and holidays will continue to accrue. As long as the employee receives a paycheck, payroll deductions for benefits such as insurance or retirement contributions will continue. 
                  Benefits During Unpaid Leave - A leave of absence prevents a break in service, but during an unpaid leave of absence no benefits will accrue (except for Military Leave). Benefits such as medical insurance and retirement contributions will be suspended after thirty (30) days unless the employee chooses to pay the required contribution. Eligibility for these benefits will be reinstated if the employee returns to work during or at the end of the approved leave period. 
                  Duplicate Use of Benefits - Employees are not allowed to use two (2) different types of paid leave benefits for the same day off. For example, if a holiday occurs while an employee is on annual leave, the employee cannot receive both annual leave pay and holiday pay for the day in question (in this example, the employee would receive holiday pay for the holiday, and his/her annual leave benefits would not be reduced by the number of holiday hours occurring during the absence). This rule applies to all types of leaves or benefits. 
                  Anniversary Date - In calculating the accrual of annual and sick leave, accrual begins on the day of original appointment to a benefit-eligible position. If an employee takes leave of absence, the anniversary date will be moved forward by as many calendar weeks as the employee is on leave of absence. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  G-3. - Annual Leave. 
                  Recognizing that employees need time away from work for rest and recreation and to manage personal business, the County provides paid Annual Leave benefits to eligible employees, within the guidelines presented in this policy. Annual leave is to be used for vacations, personal business activities, or other personal reasons. Use of annual leave is a privilege that must be approved by the appointing authority or his designee. 
                  Eligibility - All regular full-time employees will be eligible to earn and accrue annual leave benefits, as of the date of appointment to a benefit-eligible position (part-time and temporary employees are not eligible for annual leave). 
                  Accumulation Rate - Eligible employees shall accrue annual leave on a monthly basis according to the following schedule: 

                   
                  Employees who use one shift or less of sick leave per year may earn one additional shift of annual leave the following year. 
                  Maximum Accumulation - Any unused Annual Leave may be carried over from year to year up to the maximum allowable accumulation specified below. All leave above the maximum allowable accumulation is forfeited. 

                   
                  Requesting and Approval of Leave - All annual leave must be requested and approved by the department head before the leave is taken. Annual leave which exceeds 5 consecutive days must be approved by the appointing authority before the leave is taken. Vacation leave time may be granted, with approval of the appropriate department head, based on issues including: the department's staffing needs, the timeliness of request for leave time, and the employee's seniority. In case of inclement weather, employees who cannot get to work will be allowed to use vacation leave time. 
                  Restrictions - Annual leave is subject to the following additional restrictions: 
                  •  Annual leave must be earned before it can be taken. 
                  •  Annual leave does not accumulate while an employee is on unpaid leave, except as required by law. 
                  •  Annual leave and sick leave cannot be taken concurrently. 
                  •  An employee eligible for annual leave may elect to take annual leave pay without time off; however, the employee is not eligible for annual leave time off without pay at a later date. 
                  •  If two or more employees request annual leave for the same time period, seniority will be used to determine scheduling. 
                  •  Eligible employees will begin to accrue vacation benefits as of the date of employment in the eligible position. However, accrued benefits are not available to be used or paid until the employee completes the probation period. 
                  •  Overtime is not included in computation of vacation leave accrual. 
                  •  If an employee is terminated and rehired, the date of last employment is used to compute vacation leave. 
                  Payment of Annual Vacation Leave at Separation - Upon separation, the employee will be paid for all accumulated annual leave if separated in good standing. Any employee separated during their probation period will not be paid for leave accumulated during the probation period. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  G-4. - Sick Leave. 
                  Sick Leave is accumulated to be taken for legitimate illness or injury, or other medical-related situations such as physician appointments, medical examinations, or dental appointments. Sick Leave is available for the employee's personal health care as well as for care of members of the employee's immediate family. Employees are encouraged to accumulate and maintain sufficient balances of Sick Leave time to be prepared for unexpected illness, emergencies, or other personal needs. 
                  Eligibility - All regular full-time employees will be eligible to earn and accrue sick leave benefits, as of the date of appointment to a benefit-eligible position (part-time and temporary employees are not eligible for sick leave). 
                  Accumulation Rate and Maximum Allowable Accumulation - Sick leave will be accumulated at the rate of eight (8) hours per month. 

                   
                  Reporting a Sick Leave Absence - An employee who is unable to report to work for medical reasons must personally notify his/her supervisor prior to the scheduled work time. Notice must be given as far in advance of the scheduled work time as possible, and no later than within one (1) hour after the scheduled start time. If it is not possible for the employee to personally talk to the supervisor, the employee should (a) have someone else make the notification, and (b) personally call and discuss the situation with the supervisor as soon as circumstances permit. An employee absent due to illness should advise his/her supervisor on a daily basis of the employee's status and estimated date-of-return. 
                  Approval of Sick Leave - Use of sick leave requires the approval of the appointing authority or his designee. 
                  Physician's Statement - A medical statement signed by a licensed physician may be required to substantiate sick leave for the following: 
                  •  Absences of three (3) or more consecutive work days. 
                  •  To support a request for sick leave during annual leave. 
                  •  At any time when absence recurs frequently or habitually, provided the employee is forewarned. 
                  Advance of Sick Leave - The appointing authority may advance unearned sick leave to eligible employees in the case of emergencies after all earned and accumulated sick leave is exhausted. If an employee is indebted for unearned sick leave when employment is terminated, the amount due will be deducted from his or her termination pay. 
                  Payment of Sick Leave at Separation - Employees with at least twenty (20) years of continuous service will be paid for up to 240 hours of accumulated leave if separated in good standing. Employees with less than twenty (20) years will not be paid for any accumulated sick leave upon separation. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  G-5. - Funeral Leave. 
                  Up to three (3) days of annual Funeral Leave may be available to eligible employees absent from work due to the death of an immediate family member. Employees are not automatically entitled to the maximum three-day funeral leave period, but rather, the period of leave is at the discretion of the appointing authority and must be applied fairly. 
                  "Immediate family" includes the employee's spouse, parent, child, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, stepparent, or similar member of spouse's immediate family, or other relative who lives in the employee's household. Special consideration will be given to any other person whose association with the employee was similar to any of the above relationships. 
                  Eligibility - Regular full-time employees are eligible to receive up to three (3) working days of Funeral Leave benefits per occurrence or as otherwise approved by the appointing authority. 
                  Procedure to Request Funeral Leave - To request time off due to the death of an immediate family member, the eligible employee should immediately notify his/her supervisor who will forward it to the appointing authority for approval. Approval of Funeral Leave will normally be granted, unless there are unusual business needs or staffing requirements. With supervisory approval, an employee may use available annual leave or take time off without pay if additional time is needed. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  G-6. - Military Leave. 
                  Military Leave will be granted to eligible employees (excluding temporary employees) in accordance with Federal and State laws governing such leave. 
                  Eligibility - Any regular employee who leaves County service to join the military forces of the United Stated during time of war or other national emergency, or is inducted by Selective Service, may, upon written request, prior to induction into the military, be placed on Military Leave without pay, such leave to extend through a date ninety (90) days after which such service terminates. 
                  Employees who are members of the National Guard or a Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States and who are ordered to military duty or to military training may request and be granted Military Leave for the amount of time required to meet military obligations. 
                  Procedure to Request Military Leave - Employees should submit a written request for Military Leave as soon in advance as is reasonably practical. The request should include the reason for Leave, requested date to commence Leave, and date Leave will end (or estimated return date, if length of Military Leave cannot be determined). Employees who are ordered by appropriate military authority to serve during an emergency and who provide the required documentation will be granted leave without pay for the duration of their obligated military duty. 
                  Military Training or Reserve Duty - In accordance with Georgia Code 38-2-279, any regular employee who is a member of the National Guard or an organized military reserve of the United States will be allowed leave of absence with pay, not to exceed eighteen (18) calendar days (or in compliance with State law) during any calendar year, to attend training camps, upon presentation of orders concerning such training. Any employee ordered to attendance at a service school conducted by the armed forces of the United States shall be placed on military leave of absence for a period up to six (6) months and while traveling to and from such school, but not to exceed a total of six (6) months during any four (4) year period. Such leave will not be charged to vacation leave. 
                  In accordance with Georgia Code 38-2-279, in the event the Governor declares an emergency and orders an employee to military duty as a member of the National Guard, the employee shall receive pay for a period not exceeding 30 days in any one federal fiscal year. 
                  Compensation and Benefits During Military Leave - Military Leave is an unpaid leave of absence, however, employees on Military Leave may choose to use available Vacation Leave during the absence. An employee does not accrue vacation or sick leave while on Military Leave. Health insurance benefits terminate during absences of 31 days or more unless the employee elects to pay for coverage under the provisions of COBRA; health insurance will be reinstated the day an employee is reinstated with no waiting period. Employees who return to work at the end of a Military Leave are considered continuously employed for purposes of determining benefits based on length of service. 
                  Return from Military Leave - The employee is entitled to return to the vacated position, or a comparable position, provided the employee makes application to the County within ninety (90) days of date of discharge under honorable conditions, and is physically and mentally capable of performing the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation. Failure to apply for reinstatement within the allotted time period constitutes waiver of these rights. 
                  The returning employee is entitled to any across-the-board increases in salary (including cost-of-living increases) or any advancement in grade which would normally be accorded to the incumbent of the position, with exception of any increases or advancement in grade which would normally be dependent on meritorious performance of position duties. 
                  In the event a position vacated by a person entering the military service as stated above no longer exists at the time he or she qualifies to return to work, the person will be entitled to be re-employed in another position of the same status, class, and pay, provided such re-employment does not necessitate the laying off of another employee. 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  G-7. - Civil Leave. 
                  Mitchell County encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities, such as Jury Duty, Court Appearances, or Voting. All employees may be eligible for leave time (with pay or without pay) to perform required civic duties. 
                  Jury Duty - Employees who receive a summons to serve on jury duty should present a copy of the Jury Summons to his/her supervisor as soon as possible. The employee must report for work when the jury is not meeting as well as before and/or after the daily tour of jury duty, as time and circumstances warrant. The employee must continually keep his/her supervisor informed of the employee's status. Employees will be paid their regular wages while serving jury duty, and they additionally retain full payment from the court for such duty. 
                  Voting - Employees are encouraged to exercise their individual right to vote by participating in elections. Most employees should be able to vote either before or after their regular work schedule. An employee who is unable to vote in an election during non-working hours will be allowed up to two (2) hours of time off without pay. Time off for voting should be taken at the beginning or end of the regular workday, or as an extension of the employee's lunch/meal break. In addition, no employee will be given or refused employment, suspended, or discharged because of his/her vote or failure to vote in any election. 
                  Court Appearances - If a County employee is subpoenaed or ordered to appear in court as a witness pertaining to County business, or to testify in an official capacity on behalf of Federal, State, or local government, the time spent in court will be treated as time-worked and paid in accordance with standard payroll procedures. However, this policy does not apply to litigation unrelated to the employee's position with the County. Any absence from work by an employee to appear in any capacity in private litigation not associated with his/her position with the County should be charged to Annual Leave, or taken off without pay (with supervisory approval). 
                  (Res. No. 2010-005, 1-12-2010) 
                  G-8. - Family and Medical Leave. 
                  Under the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), an employee may be granted up to twelve (12) weeks of leave during any twelve (12) month period. Leave is allowable under FMLA for the following events: 
                  a)  The birth, adoption, or foster care of a child; 
                  b)  Care for an employee's child, spouse, or parent (but not a parent "in-law") with a serious health condition; or, 
                  c)  The serious health condition of an employee where the employee is unable to perform the essential function of his/her position. 
                  Eligibility - To be eligible for leave under FMLA, an employee must have been employed for at least twelve (12) months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month period immediately preceding commencement of the leave. After satisfying this criteria, an employee may take up to twelve (12) weeks of FMLA leave per year as long as they work at least 1,250 hours in a rolling twelve (12) month period. (A rolling twelve-month period is defined as a twelve-month period measured backwards from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave). FMLA leave may be taken intermittently in increments of two (2) hours. 
                  Paid/Unpaid Status - FMLA leave may be paid or unpaid. It is considered "paid" when an employee uses sick leave or annual leave for a condition that qualifies for this type of leave. For example, an employee can use sick and/or annual leave for birth of a child, and the time taken will be counted toward the twelve (12) weeks per year of FMLA leave. Once an employee exhausts available paid leave benefits, any additional leave taken for family purposes will be without pay, or "unpaid". During periods of unpaid leave, no sick or annual leave benefits will accrue, nor will holiday pay provisions apply. The employee is required to pay his/her contribution for insurance premiums while on unpaid FMLA leave. 
                  Dual Spouses - When spouses are both employed by the County, they are entitled to a combined total of twelve (12) weeks of FMLA leave within the twelve (12) month period to care for a new child or sick parent. Each spouse may be entitled to additional FMLA leave for other FMLA qualifying reasons. (For example, if each spouse took six (6) weeks of leave to care for a newborn child, each could later use an additional six (6) weeks due to his/her own serious health condition or to care for a child with a serious health condition.) 
                  Procedures to Request FMLA Leave - Procedures to request leave under the FMLA are as follows: 
                  1)  An employee must request FMLA leave at least thirty (30) days before leave is to begin when the leave is foreseeable (such as an expected birth, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or planned medical treatment of the employee or family member). 
                  2)  If thirty (30) days notice to request leave is not feasible due to medical emergency or change in circumstances, leave must be requested as soon as possible (generally means at least giving verbal notice to the employer within one or two business days of learning of the need to take FMLA leave). 
                  3)  An employee must submit written request for FMLA leave by completing the employer's designated leave request form. In emergency situations where written notification is not possible, verbal notice will be accepted, to be followed by written request. 
                  4)  The written leave request must be signed by the employee's immediate supervisor and department head, and then approved by the County Administrator. 
                  5)  If leave is due to the employee's own serious health condition or to care for a family member, the employee must obtain medical certification from a physician. This certification must be submitted with the written leave request within fifteen (15) calendar days of submitting the request, and must contain the following information: 
                  a)  Name of the health care physician; 
                  b)  The physician's type of medical practice or specialty; 
                  c)  Medical facts that support the certification; 
                  d)  Explanation of how the condition qualifies as a serious health condition under FMLA; 
                  e)  Date the serious condition began; and 
                  f)  Duration of serious health condition and estimate of length of incapacitation. 
                  6)  The County may contact the physician to clarify any information given in the medical certification, but may not request information beyond that described above. 
                  7)  The County will notify the employee within two (2) business days regarding approval of leave or requirement for additional information. 
                  8)  If there is any doubt as to validity of original certification, the County may require the employee to submit to 2nd certification by another physician (at County expense). The County may designate the physician, but not one regularly employed by the County. In the event of differing opinions from the employee's physician and the County's physician, the County may require certification from a 3rd physician (again at County expense). The 3rd physician must be jointly approved by the employee and the County, and this 3rd opinion will be final and binding. 
                  9)  The County may request re-certification every thirty (30) days for serious illness, or when the employee is under supervision of a health care provider. 
                  10)  The County may require employees on leave to periodically report on their status and intent to return to work. 
                  11)  Failure of an employee to return to work on the agreed-upon date may result in termination of employment. 
                  Return to Work - Procedures for an employee to return to work under Family and Medical Leave are as follows: 
                  1)  The employee may be required to obtain and present certification from the health care provider confirming that the employee is able to resume working. 
                  2)  The employee will be returned to the former position or to a position of equal status, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. 
                  3)  Exceptions to restoration to an equivalent position when an employee returns are: 
                  a)  The employee is no longer able to perform essential functions of the job. 
                  b)  The employee is considered a "key employee" where denial of job restoration is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operation of the County. 
                  Any questions concerning the Family and Medical Leave Act should be directed to the employee's supervisor or the County Administrator.

                  SECTION H. - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 

                  H-1. - General Benefits Information. 
                  Mitchell County provides a wide range of benefits, which represent a significant portion of an employee's overall compensation package. Eligibility for benefits is dependent upon a variety of factors, including employee classification. The Hiring and Employment Practices section of this Handbook describes each employment category and the associated eligibility for benefits. Some benefit programs may require contributions from employees, and some may be fully or partially paid by the County. A number of programs (such as Social Security, worker's compensation, and unemployment insurance) cover all employees in the manner prescribed by law. 
                  Employees are encouraged to become familiar with the benefit programs for which they are eligible, and take advantage of these valuable benefits. The County will designate a person or office to serve as its "benefit contact" to provide information about benefits and maintain plan documents. Employees should direct any questions about benefits to the designated benefit contact.

                  H-2. - Holidays. 
                  Following are the official holidays that will be observed by the County: 

                   
                  The County will publish the approved holiday schedule at the beginning of each calendar year. Changes to the holiday schedule may be made at the County's discretion. When a holiday falls on a Saturday, it will generally be observed on the preceding Friday. When a holiday falls on a Sunday, it will generally be observed on the following Monday. 
                  Eligibility - All regular full-time employees are eligible to receive holiday pay for scheduled holidays. Holiday pay will be calculated based on the employee's regular hourly rate as of the date of the holiday, and holiday hours do not count as hours worked for purpose of determining overtime. 
                  Working on Holidays - Some employees may be required to work on a designated holiday, due to their regular work schedule or emergencies. Such an employee will receive holiday pay (per the provisions of "Eligibility" in the section above) in addition to pay for actual time worked. 
                  Holidays While On Authorized/Unauthorized Leave - An employee must work or take paid leave either the day before or the day after a holiday in order to be paid for the holiday. An employee who is not on approved leave and fails to report on his or her scheduled work day before and after a holiday will not be paid for the holiday. Holidays that occur during approved vacation or sick leave will not be charged against the employee's vacation or sick leave accruals. 
                  Sick Time in Conjunction with a Holiday - No employee may use sick time the day before or the day after a holiday without a written doctor's notice.

                  H-3. - Group Insurance Plans. 
                  Mitchell County offers a variety of options for medical, life, or other insurance coverage for eligible employees. Types of insurance plans available and options within each plan may vary from year to year. The County typically pays for all or most of an eligible employee's insurance premiums in a given plan, and employees may have the option of purchasing additional individual or family coverage at group rates. 
                  Insurance Programs available to eligible employees may include: Health Insurance, Dental Insurance, Life Insurance, Vision Insurance, Short-Term Disability Insurance, and/or Long-Term Disability Insurance. Details regarding available benefit plans, eligibility for each plan, rates, enrollment procedures, and enrollment deadlines will be provided at hire, during scheduled enrollment periods, and when new plans are introduced. 
                  Annual enrollment sessions are typically conducted at a designated time each year, and employees may elect to change coverage only at that time (unless an employee should experience a qualifying event as defined by plan documents during the plan year, in which case the employee may only change enrollment within thirty days of the qualifying event). 
                  Employees should contact the County's designated benefit contact person for information or questions about benefit issues. 
                  Insurance Benefits During Unpaid Leave of Absence - A participating employee who is placed on unpaid leave of absence status is required to pay for both the employee's share and the County's share of his/her insurance premiums, or coverage will be terminated. The employee should make advance arrangements to pay premiums directly to the County, to avoid loss of important benefits. 
                  Continuation of Insurance Benefits (COBRA) - Group health insurance benefits will terminate when an employee terminates employment. However, the Federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives employees and their qualified dependents the opportunity to continue medical insurance coverage under the County's health plan when a "qualifying event" would normally result in loss of eligibility. Examples of qualifying events include termination of employment, death of employee, change in eligibility status, leave of absence, divorce or legal separation, retirement, or a dependent no longer meeting eligibility requirements. Under COBRA, the employee or dependent pays the full cost of coverage at the County's group rates, plus an administration fee. The County will provide a written notice describing rights under COBRA when the employee becomes eligible for coverage under the County's health plan. Employees should notify the designated benefit contact if they experience any change in personal status which might affect their benefits or if they have questions about COBRA or other benefit issues.

                  H-4. - Education Benefits. 
                  The County will consider paying the cost of approved courses that will increase the employee's job skills. Prior approval for such course work must be obtained from the appointing authority. Classes scheduled during working hours must have prior approval from the appointing authority. For more information, employees should contact their supervisor or the designated benefit contact person. 
                  Should any employee voluntarily leave employment with the County within one (1) year of the training, the County reserves the right to deduct the expenses for the training from the employee's final paycheck. This right extends to two years for state mandated certifications and/or licenses relating to positions in public safety.

                  H-6. - Workers' Compensation Insurance. 
                  The County operates under Georgia's Workers' Compensation Law. An employee who is temporarily disabled because of an injury or illness sustained directly in the performance of his or her work may be covered by the provisions of the State Workers' Compensation Act. Rules and regulations of the Act will govern all worker's compensation issues. Workers must report all accidents immediately by personally advising the employer. 
                  Employee safety at work is important, and safety standards and procedures should be followed at all times. In the event of a compensable injury, Workers' Compensation provides payment of medical and rehabilitation expenses within the limits of the law. In some cases the County will also pay part of wages lost due to the work-related injury. The amount of benefits payable and duration of payment depend on the nature of injury or illness. In general, however, all eligible medical expenses incurred in connection with a work-related injury or illness are paid in full, and appropriate salary payments are provided in accordance with workers' compensation laws. 
                  Reporting an Accident or Injury - Any employee who is injured on the job must immediately report such injury to the immediate supervisor and/or department head, regardless of how minor the injury may appear to be. This ensures prompt and appropriate medical treatment, allows for timely completion of required reports in accordance with law, and enables an eligible employee to qualify for coverage as quickly as possible. The worker may lose the right to receive compensation if an accident is not reported within thirty (30) days. Work injuries and occupational diseases should be reported in writing whenever possible. 
                  Use of Designated Physicians - A worker injured on the job must select a doctor from the Panel of Physicians posted on the employer's property. If an employee chooses to visit a physician who is not on the Panel of Physicians, the employee will be liable for any medical expenses incurred. The Panel Physician may arrange for appropriate consultations, referrals, and other specialized services as the nature of the injury requires. If the employee is dissatisfied with the physician selected, he or she may make one (1) change without permission of the employer/insurer, self-insurer claims office, or the State Board of Workers' Compensation. 
                  Post-Accident Drug Testing for Accidents or Injuries - All employees involved in work-related accidents or injuries are subject to post-accident drug screening testing. 
                  Return to Work - An employee who has lost time due to a work-related injury or illness must obtain a doctor's statement for the time missed and a "release statement" to return to work. Doctor's notes that specify "Light Duty" restrictions must be adhered to by both the employee and the supervisor. Employees who are in a non-pay status due to an injury will not accrue annual or sick leave, and are not eligible for holiday pay. 
                  Off-Duty Activities - Neither the County nor its workers' compensation insurance carrier will be liable for payment of workers' compensation benefits for injuries that occur during an employee's voluntary participation in any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by the County.

                  H-7. - Carry-Home Vehicles. 
                  Mitchell County may provide certain employees with a County vehicle as part of the employee's compensation and benefits package. In such cases where the employee is allowed to use the vehicle for personal use, the value of the personal use is considered a taxable benefit and must be reported to the IRS. 
                  The employee is required to report to the County the portion of the annual lease value of the vehicle that is used for personal reasons as described under IRS rules. The portion of the annual lease value that is of a personal usage will be reported on the employee's W-2 form to the IRS. In addition, since the County provides operation and maintenance of the vehicle, the employee must maintain a record of mileage related to the personal usage, which must be reported by the County as income at per-mile rate. The benefit gained by the employee for personal use of a County vehicle during the each calendar year must be reported on the employee's W-2 form for that calendar year.

                  Uniforms - The County will furnish uniforms for employees in positions that require uniforms.

Such employees may not use the assigned County vehicle for personal purposes other than commuting or de minimis personal use.

                  Mitchell County provides work areas, desks, computers, vehicles, equipment, tools, and other property for use by employees in association with their employment with the County. These items are property of the County, and the County retains the right to inspect or monitor such property at any time. As such, an employee should have no expectation of privacy with respect to County property. Under no circumstances should County property be utilized for the personal use of any employee, nor may County property be used in an inappropriate or illicit manner. The misuse, abuse, or misappropriation of County equipment, supplies, or funds can lead to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.

                  Care of Property - All employees are expected to follow operating instructions and safety guidelines, perform required maintenance, and exercise care in using equipment. Supervisors can provide guidance about each employee's responsibility to care for and maintain equipment used on the job. Employees should notify supervisors if any equipment or tools appear to be damaged, defective, or in need of repair. 
                  Property Inspections - Since work areas, desks, computers, telephones, vehicles, equipment, tools, supplies, and other property provided for use by employees in their jobs are County property, they are subject to monitoring and inspection by County management at any time. The County reserves the right to open and inspect any vehicles or items of any kind on County property, and the contents of same, at any time, with or without reason, notice, or consent. Employees on County property, and the contents of any item carried by employees on County property, may be subject to search. 
                  Workplace Monitoring - Workplace monitoring may be conducted by the County in accordance with applicable laws, for purposes of ensuring security, safety, quality control, and customer satisfaction. Employees who regularly communicate with customers may have their telephone conversations monitored or recorded. Telephone monitoring is used to identify and correct performance problems through targeted training. The County may conduct video surveillance of non-private workplace areas. Video monitoring is used to identify safety concerns, maintain quality control, detect theft and misconduct, and discourage or prevent acts of harassment or violence. However, the County is sensitive to the legitimate privacy rights of employees, and every effort will be made to ensure that workplace monitoring is done in an ethical and respectful manner. 
                  Monitoring of Communication Systems - Computers and communications systems furnished for the use of employees are County property and, as such, may be monitored. The County reserves the right to access and search all directories, files, databases, storage devices, faxes, e-mail messages, Internet access, voice mail messages, or other electronic transmissions contained in or used in conjunction with County systems, including the County's computer, voice mail, e-mail, telephone, Internet, or other communications systems, with no prior notice.

                  Personal Telephone Use - Personal telephone calls during work time must be kept to minimum. It is understood that certain personal calls are necessary; however, personal calls should be local and should be brief, as they disrupt the normal work process. In the event it becomes necessary for an employee to make a personal long-distance call during the workday, the employee should take an uncompensated break and the call may not be charged to the County. 
                  Mail Systems - The use of County-paid postage for personal correspondence is not permitted. This includes stamps, machine-applied postage, downloaded postage, shipping/mailing services, delivery services, or any other type of mail system funded by the County.

                  I-4. - Internet Policy. 
                  Mitchell County provides Internet service as a tool to assist authorized employees in performing their work. This tool, and the work product it contains, is County property and should be used only for business purposes. Employees who do not require access to the Internet as part of their official duties may not access the Internet using County equipment. 
                  Employees must exercise care in using the Internet so as to not reflect negatively on the County or its employees. Any outgoing messages or postings to public forums which do not reflect the official position of the County must include a disclaimer that the opinions are that of the employee and not of the employer. 
                  Employees may find some information on the Internet offensive or otherwise objectionable. Individuals should be aware that the County has no control over and, therefore, cannot be responsible for the content of information available on the Internet. 
                  Files or other resources that are not used for a clear County purpose may not be accessed or downloaded. Any resource that requires a fee may not be accessed or downloaded without prior approval of the department head. Files may not be downloaded from the Internet to a County computer without express consent of the department head. Any files expressly approved for downloading must first be scanned by virus detection software. Websites may not be created or implemented without prior approval of the department head and review by the County Administrator. 
                  No Right to Privacy - An employee's rights while accessing the Internet by use of County property do not include the right to privacy. The County reserves the right to monitor in any way the activities of employees while accessing the Internet. All Internet activity is subject to login and monitoring to provide a chronological history of events and to maintain audit trails of usage. The County may automatically monitor Internet activity via software. 
                  De Minimis Use - The County will allow "de minimis" personal use of the Internet, meaning that a limited amount of personal communications, while not sanctioned, is not prohibited by this policy. Generally, de minimis personal use includes such uses as adding a personal comment to an official e-mail, sending a short personal note to a colleague, or other personal interactions that are a routine part of day-to-day business interaction. Reasonable judgment should be applied to individual circumstances. The County retains sole discretion to determine what use is considered de minimis, and to discipline for all other use. 
                  Inappropriate Use - Use of the Internet is a privilege, not a right, and carries responsibilities that reflect ethical and responsible use. Inappropriate use (or any use that violates the intended purpose for the employee's authorized access) will result in disciplinary action. In general, any use that is not directly related to an employees work duties is considered inappropriate. The following are examples of inappropriate use, and include visiting sites that meet these definitions whether or not the employee directly interacts with the site (this is not meant to include law enforcement or other officials conducting official business related to public safety): 
                  •  Harassment, discrimination, threats, or racial slurs. 
                  •  Obscene activities; pornography; receipt, storage, or distribution of sexually explicit materials. 
                  •  Violence, gambling, illegal activities, or any violations of Federal, State, or local law. 
                  •  Copyright violations (reproducing or distributing copyrighted information). 
                  •  Profanity, vulgarity, offensive conduct or inappropriate behavior. 
                  •  Games, recreational sites, or other materials. 
                  Violations of County policy regarding Internet use may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 
                  I-5. - E-mail Policy. 
                  The County uses electronic mail as a tool to facilitate business communications. Any form of e-mail system installed on County equipment is for County business purposes only. Employees are accountable for their use of electronic communications just as they are for other conduct and communications in the workplace. 
                  Although the County utilizes electronic filtering programs to block unsolicited messages, employees may find the content of some e-mail messages offensive or otherwise objectionable. Individuals should be aware that the County has no control over and, therefore, cannot be responsible for the content of all information received through electronic mail. Also, employees should know the source of incoming e-mails before attempting to open messages, as computer viruses are commonly spread by embedding a virus within e-mail attachments and may not be caught by virus scanning software. 
                  No Right to Privacy - Employees should not expect privacy or confidentiality in any e-mail communications using County computers. The County reserves the right to monitor e-mail messages in any way, and may enter the e-mail system to review, copy, or delete any messages, to disclose such messages to others, and to use the messages to support disciplinary or other action. All e-mail messages are considered to be public records, and are subject to examination by the public. Employees should not use the County e-mail system for private communications. 
                  Inappropriate Use - Use of the County's e-mail system is a privilege, not a right, and carries responsibilities that reflect ethical and responsible use. Inappropriate use will result in disciplinary action. In general, communications that are not directly related to an employee's work duties, or communications that would be inappropriate under other County policies, are equally unacceptable if delivered via electronic communication. Following are examples of inappropriate use: 
                  •  Personal use. 
                  •  Business or profit-making activities (not related to County business). 
                  •  Offensive conduct or inappropriate behavior. 
                  •  Profanity or vulgarity. 
                  •  Harassment, discrimination, sexism, threats, or racial slurs. 
                  •  Obscene activities; pornography; receipt, storage, or distribution of sexually explicit materials. 
                  •  Violence, gambling, illegal activities, or any violations of Federal, State, or local law. 
                  •  Copyright violations; reproducing or distributing copyrighted information. 
                  •  Entering into contracts or agreements on behalf of the County. 
                  •  Transmission of confidential or sensitive information. 
                  Violations of County policy regarding e-mail use may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.

                  The sole exceptions to this policy are charitable and community activities supported by County management and County-sponsored programs related to County services.

                  I-8. - Inclement Weather and Emergency Situations. 
                  In the event the County Administrator declares a weather emergency or other emergency situation that may involve closing County offices, those employees who have been designated in advance as essential to dealing with such emergencies are expected to be prepared to report to work as assigned. Other employees may also be called to work in an emergency situation, even if not designated in advance. Employees who work during a declared weather emergency will be paid according the County's compensation plan, although the County Administrator may make provisions for additional pay or compensatory time as deemed warranted. 
                  When inclement weather makes roads hazardous, employees should find a safe means of transportation to work. However, employees are not required to take unreasonable risks. Employees who are unable to report to work may be required to use available annual leave for missed time, or may be required to make up time lost during the same work period when possible. 
                  If a weather emergency has not been declared and an employee is absent from work due to weather conditions, the employee may be charged with an unexcused absence if circumstances do not appear to create a hazard. However, at the discretion of the department head or County Administrator, the employee may make up the time lost from work (at a time scheduled by the department head), or use leave time, or take the time off without pay.

                  I-9. - Posting of Management Information. 
                  The County maintains a centralized bulletin board in the Board of Commissioner's Office for posting/conveying official County information from management to employees, such as notices from Federal or State agencies, safety information, legal notices, benefit information, job announcements, or information of special interest. Employees are responsible for reading all information posted. No personal announcements may be posted in this location.

                  I-10. - Travel Expense Reimbursement. 
                  Mitchell County will bear the cost of all reasonable and authorized expenses incurred by employees or County officials while traveling on official County business. All travel at the expense of the County must be approved by the department manager and/or County Administrator prior to the time such expenses are incurred. 
                  Travel Requisitions and Approval - Employees should complete appropriate forms and follow established procedures to request and receive approval for travel prior to incurring any expenses. Requests should include all available information concerning purpose, location, dates, and costs of the event, and should be submitted as far in advance as possible. Departmental needs and budgetary constraints will be considered to determine if the requested travel event is appropriate. 
                  Travel Advances - If the travel event is approved, the employee may submit a travel advance request no less than one (1) week prior to departure. Travel advances will be limited to maximum allowable amounts multiplied by the number of days. 
                  Reimbursable Expenses - Employees are expected to show good judgment and proper regard for economy in the matter of travel expense. Typical expenses that may be reimbursed by the County include transportation, lodging, meals, telephone, parking, and registration fees. Other expenses require specific consideration and approval. The County may establish limitations for reimbursement of certain expenses, and employees should review current reimbursement guidelines prior to incurring travel expenses. 
                  Submittal of Expense Reports - After completion of travel, the employee must complete the County's designated expense report form and submit with original receipts to the department head for approval. Any travel funds advanced to the employee must be reflected on the expense report. Expense reports are considered due on the first working day after completion of travel. If an employee should fail to return a completed expense report, any amount disbursed as a travel advance will be considered income to the employee and will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service as such.
