PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Fort Valley, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the republication were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through December 17, 1992, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Amy Norton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Karin Vinson, City Administrator, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  (1965 Ga. Laws (Act No. 192), page 2526, § 2; 1991 Ga. Laws (Act No. 74), page 3701, § 1; Res. No. 04-0920-50, 9-20-2004; Ord. No. 15-0416-26, 5-21-2015; Ord. No. 15-0618-31, 6-18-2015) 
                  Editor's note— The act approved March 24, 1965 (1965 Ga. Laws, 1965 (Act No. 192), page 2526) amended the city Charter to provide for election of councilmen and utility commissioners to specified posts and to require a majority vote for their election as well as for the election of the mayor. On May 13, 1974, the U.S. Department of Justice, acting pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Acts of 1965, refused to sanction the implementation of these provisions. Subsequent municipal elections before the 1991 amendment were conducted on a nonpost, plurality basis. 
                  Charter reference— Utility commission, § 28A. 
                  State Law reference— Date of general municipal election, O.C.G.A. § 21-2-9(b); filing notice of candidacy, O.C.G.A. § 21-2-132; Charter may govern vote required, O.C.G.A. § 21-2-501. 
                  Sec. 4. - Filling of vacancies in office of mayor and alderman. 
                  In case of a vacancy in any of the offices mentioned in any of the preceding sections by death, resignation, failure to elect, removal from office, removal from city, or otherwise, the same shall be filled by the mayor and aldermen. The person or persons to be selected to serve until the next general election in said city, at which general election the unexpired term shall be filled by election by the qualified voters of said city. In case of such a vacancy in the office of mayor, the vacancy shall be filled by election by a majority vote of the aldermen of the city until the said general election. 
                  Sec. 5. - Election managers. 
                  All elections held under the provisions of this Charter shall be superintended and managed by a justice of the peace, or some other judicial officer, and two (2) freeholders, or three (3) freeholders, all of whom shall be citizens of said city; and each of said managers, before entering on his duties, shall take an oath before some justice of the peace, or other officer duly qualified to administer an oath, that he will faithfully and impartially conduct said election and prevent all illegal voting to the best of his skill and power; and said managers shall cause to be kept two (2) lists of voters and two (2) tally sheets of said election. 
                  Editor's note— This section has been superseded by the Georgia Election Code (O.C.G.A. § 21-2-1 et seq.). 
                  State Law reference— Poll officers, O.C.G.A. § 21-2-90 et seq. 
                  Sec. 6. - Election precincts; hours open; manner of election; absentee voting. 
                  [(a)]  The mayor and city council of Fort Valley shall by ordinances prescribe one or more voting places, or election precincts, within said city, and the polls at every such election shall open at 7:00 a.m. and close at 7:00 p.m., according to the legal time prevailing in the State of Georgia. 
                  [(b)]  Persons who are qualified to vote in any election held by the City of Fort Valley who, because of physical disability or because of being away from the voting precinct on the date of election, shall apply in writing to the city clerk either in person or by some member of his immediate family for an absentee ballot not more than thirty (30) days nor less than one (1) day prior to the date of the election stating his reason therein for requesting an absentee ballot and it shall be the duty of the clerk then to deliver either in person or by mail a ballot to said applicant to be voted in the same manner as is prescribed by the legislature for absentee voting for the members of the General Assembly of Georgia. 
                  Editor's note— The time during which polls are open is preempted by the Georgia Election Code (O.C.G.A. § 21-2-1 et seq.). The final sentence of section 6 has been omitted. See editor's note [for] section 3. 1991 Ga. Laws (Act No. 74), page 3701, § 2, purports to delete from section 6 the words "The person or persons receiving the highest number of votes cast at such election for mayor and aldermen, respectively, shall be declared elected." 
                  State Law reference— Election precincts, O.C.G.A. § 21-2-260; absentee voting, O.C.G.A. § 21-2-380 et seq.; hours of opening and closing polls, O.C.G.A. § 21-2-403. 
                  Sec. 7. - Voter lists, tally sheets, ballots; contest of elections. 
                  After the voters at any election shall have been counted by the managers, they shall certify two (2) lists of voters and two (2) tally sheets, and shall place one of said tally sheets with the ballots in the ballot box and preserve same for the space of sixty (60) days, after the expiration of which sixty (60) days said managers shall destroy the contents of said ballot box without examining said ballots or allowing the same to be done, provided, no notice of contest shall be filed or pending. The other list of voters and tally sheets shall be filed by the managers with the clerk and treasurer of said city. If the results of any election held in said city is contested, notice of such contest shall be filed with the ordinary [judge of probate] of Houston County [now Peach] within three (3) days after such election, setting forth all the grounds of contest; and upon the payment of a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) in advance, to said ordinary [judge of probate], then said ordinary [judge of probate] shall, within two (2) days after he receives the same, cause a copy of said notice to be served by the sheriff or his deputy on the contestee, if said contest is for an office, and if the result of any election in which any question is submitted is contested, then the ordinary [judge of probate] shall cause notice to be served on the mayor of the city and published one time in a newspaper of general circulation in said city. Said ordinary [judge of probate] shall fix the time of hearing said contest, which shall not be later than ten (10) days after service has been perfected, of which time both parties shall have five (5) days' notice before the hearing. The contestor shall pay the sheriff or his deputy two dollars ($2.00) in advance for serving the notice of contest. All contests shall be heard at the courthouse of Houston [now Peach] County.

                  (Res. No. 04-0318-14, 3-18-2004) 
                  Editor's note— Pursuant to memorandum from the city attorney in 1982, the following is stated: Prior to 1973, the Georgia Code section simply authorized the governing authority to fix the salary, compensation and expenses of municipal employees. The legislature then amended this section to allow the governing authority to fix the salary, compensation, and expenses of "the municipal employees and members of the governing authority" (1973 Ga. Laws, pages 778, 780). In 1979, the section was further amended to include the compensation of "any elective municipal official who exercises any executive or legislative or executive and legislative powers of the municipality, specifically including a mayor, vice-mayor, president or chairman of a city council, member of a city council, member of a board of aldermen, or member of a board of commissioners" (1979 Ga. Laws, pages 645, 648). It appears that these provisions have impliedly repealed the salary limitations stated in section 13 of the Charter as to mayor and council. It also appears that the limitation on the former recorder's salary was likewise repealed in view of the provisions of section 3 of the Charter that his compensation was fixed in the same manner as salaries of the mayor and aldermen. It is doubtful that the salary limitations as to the chairman and members of the utility commission were repealed by the state law. The 1979 amendment cited above applied only to compensation of elective municipal officials who exercise executive or legislative powers of the municipality, which a utility commissioner does not exercise. 
                  Sec. 14. - Executive powers of mayor. 
                  The mayor shall be the chief executive of the City of Fort Valley; he shall see that all laws, ordinances, resolutions, and rules of the city are faithfully executed and enforced, and that all officers of the city shall faithfully discharge their duties required of them. He shall have a general jurisdiction of the affairs of the city. He shall preside at all meetings of the mayor and city council of Fort Valley. He shall have the right to vote in the elections for officers, except as hereinafter provided, and upon all other questions before said body, except upon questions where he is disqualified by reason of interest, relationship, or otherwise. 
                  Sec. 15. - Recorder's court. 
                  (a)  Established; jurisdiction; presiding officer. There shall be a municipal court established for the City of Fort Valley, Georgia, known as the recorder's court, which shall have jurisdiction to try offenses against the laws and ordinances of the municipal government. Said court shall have power to enforce its judgments by inflicting such penalties as may be provided by the ordinances, punish witnesses for nonattendance, and also punish any person who shall counsel or advise; aid, encourage or intimidate a witness whose testimony is material or desired before said court, to absent himself, or to go away or remove beyond the reach of the processes of the court. Said court shall have full jurisdiction throughout the entire county of Houston [now Peach] and full power and authority for the purpose of compelling the attendance before said court, residing anywhere in said County of Houston [now Peach]. Such court shall be presided over by the recorder, or in his absence or disability or disqualification, by the mayor or the mayor pro tem, and said court shall be held at such times and as often as may be necessary to try all offenders against the city ordinances, the time of holding said court to be fixed by the presiding officer.

Either one or all of said sentences may be imposed, in the discretion of the presiding officer. He shall also have the same power as judges of the superior courts of the State of Georgia to punish for contempt by a fine not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) or imprisonment in the city jail not exceeding fifteen (15) days. He shall be to all intents and purposes a justice of the peace so far as to enable him to issue warrants for offenses committed within the corporate limits of the city, which warrants may be executed by any member of the police force of said city and to try and commit the offenders to the jail of Peach County or admit them to bail in bailable cases for their appearance at the next term of a court of competent jurisdiction to be held in and for said county. 
                  (c)  Election of recorder; qualifications, etc. The mayor and board of aldermen may elect a city recorder, who shall be at least twenty-five (25) years of age and who shall have resided for one year next preceding his election in the City of Fort Valley, and who shall be a qualified voter therein; who shall be a freeholder owning real estate within the corporate limits of the City of Fort Valley; and before entering upon the duties of his office he shall take an oath before some officer authorized to administer oaths, that he will truly, faithfully and honestly discharge the duties of his office to the best of his skill and ability, without fear, favor or affection, reward or the hope thereof and to do even justice between the city and the accused. This oath shall be entered on the minutes of the mayor and board of aldermen. The recorder may be removed from office by the mayor and board of aldermen after trial and conviction had before the same upon written charges of neglect of duty, malpractice in office or other conduct unbecoming his station. The vote of a majority of said mayor and board of aldermen shall be necessary for such conviction and removal. Said recorder when elected shall be clothed with the rights, powers and privileges of the mayor as to said recorder's court, and shall preside over said court. Compensation of said recorder is to be fixed by the mayor and city council of Fort Valley in the same manner as salaries of the mayor and aldermen are now fixed. The said recorder shall be elected for a term of two (2) years. 
                  Editor's note— The limitation on the joint mayor-recorder salary has been omitted. For salaries, see section 13. 
                  (d)  Ministerial officers. The city clerk or some employee designated by the city administrator, shall attend the sessions of said court and act as clerk thereof, who shall sign and issue all processes, summonses, subpoenas, attachments, and all other processes issuing out of said court, all of which shall bear teste in the name of the mayor. The ministerial officers of said court {shall be} shall include the city marshal, the chief of police and the entire police force of said city, any of whom, with the exception of the member designated to act as clerk, may execute and return the mandates of said court, and to whom, in the alternative, all mesne and final process shall be directed. The chief of police, or some member of the police force designated by him shall attend all sessions of said court for the purpose of executing the necessary orders thereof and enforcing order therein. 
                  (e)  Mayor pro tem to preside in disability of recorder and mayor. In the absence, sickness or disqualification of the mayor and of the recorder, the mayor pro tem of said city shall be clothed with all the powers of mayor and shall hold the recorder's court. 
                  (f)  Rules. The mayor and board of aldermen shall have full power and authority to pass all laws and ordinances, rules and regulations necessary and proper to secure the efficient and successful administration of the business of this court.

Whenever any person convicted in said court, or his attorney, shall give notice that he intends to apply for a writ of certiorari it shall be the duty of the mayor or recorder or other officer presiding over said court to suspend said sentence until said certiorari shall have been heard and determined by said superior court, and in case of appeal from the decision of the superior court to the supreme court or the court of appeals, until there is a final determination of said case, in said court of last resort. But no person convicted in said recorder's court shall be released from custody until he shall have given a good and sufficient bond and security, to be fixed and approved by the presiding officer of said court for his appearance to carry out and perform said sentence in the event the same is affirmed.

Any number of streets, avenues, alleys, lanes, or other public places or parts thereof to be so improved may be included in one resolution or ordinance, but any protest or objection shall be made as to each street or other highway separately, except as treated as one project, as hereinafter provided; provided, however, that if the owners of more than one-half (½) of the front feet of the land liable to assessment for any such improvement shall petition the City of Fort Valley for such improvement of any street or part of street, alley, lane, or avenue, or other public place described in such petition, the character of the improvement desired, the width of the same, and the material preferred by petitioners for such improvement, it shall thereupon be the duty of said City of Fort Valley, by its mayor and city council, to promptly cause the said improvement to be made in accordance with the prayer of said petition, the type of improvement, curbing, guttering, or sidewalk, the width of same, and the materials to be used to be determined by the mayor and city council of Fort Valley, and in such cases, the resolution or ordinance hereinbefore mentioned shall not be required; provided, however, that where two (2) or more streets running in the same general direction from one continuous way, they may be treated as one street, and the improvement thereof, as in this act [section] provided, shall constitute one project and shall be dealt with accordingly as to resolutions, ordinances, or petitions of property owners or protest by property owners, or other proceedings. 
                  (c)  Cost; pro rata payment; assessment.

                  (d)  Installation of water, gas, sewer pipe. Whenever the petition provided for in section 3 [subsection (b)] of this act [section] is presented, or when the City of Fort Valley, by its mayor and city council, shall have determined to curb, pave, or improve any street, avenue, lane, or alley or other public place, and shall have passed the resolution or ordinance provided for in section 3 [subsection (b)] of this act [section], the said City of Fort Valley, by its mayor and city council, shall then have the power to enact all ordinances and to establish all such rules and regulations as may be necessary to require the owners of all property subject to assessment to pay the entire cost of such improvement, and to cause to be put in and constructed all water, gas, or sewer pipe in and underneath the streets, avenues, lanes, alleys, and all other public places where such public improvements are to be made, or any storm sewerage or drainage installation which may be necessary collaterally to care for the proper drainage of any paving project or projects provided for in this act [section], and all cost and expense thereof shall be taxed against such property, and shall be included and made a part of the general assessment to cover the cost of such improvement. 
                  (e)  Commencement of work; advertisement for bids; award of contract.

And it shall be the duty of said treasurer, promptly at the date of the maturity of any such installment or assessment and interest, and on or before the fifteenth day of September of each year, in case of a default in payment of such installment or assessment with interest, to issue an execution against the lots or tract of land assessed for improvement, or against the party or persons owning the same for the amount of such assessment with interest, and shall turn over the same to the marshal of the City of Fort Valley, or his deputy, who shall levy the same upon the adjoining real estate liable for such improvement. And after advertisement and other proceedings, as in case of sales for city taxes of said city, the same shall be sold at public outcry, as in other city tax sales, to the highest bidder, and such sales shall vest an absolute title in the purchaser, subject to the lien of the remaining unpaid installments or assessments with interest, provided, that the defendant shall have the right to file an affidavit denying that the whole or any part of the amount for which said execution issued is due, and stating what amount he admits to be due, which amount so admitted to be due shall be paid or collected before the affidavit is received, and affidavit received for the balance.

The failure of said treasurer to publish said notice of the maturity of any installment of said assessment and interest shall in no wise affect the validity of the assessment and interest and the execution issued therefor. 
                  (k)  Suit to set aside, enjoin improvements; limitation.

Laws, page 900 and 1945 Ga. Laws, page 885, by granting to the mayor and city council and board of water and light commissioners of the city certain additional powers; 1953 Ga. Laws, Nov. Sess., page 2817, §§ 6, 7, superseded and/or added to the above acts and also 1949 Ga. Laws, page 443, 1950 Ga. Laws, page 2110, and 1953 Ga. Laws, Jan. Sess., page 2542, by repeating some of the provisions thereof, incorporating by reference to said acts the powers and duties of said board and renaming said board as the "utility commission." However, as to filling casual vacancies, reference must be had to section 3 of the 1909 Act, which reads as follows: "That F. O. Miller, A. J. Evans, O. G. Singleton and A. B. Greene, be and constitute the members of said board of water and light commissioners. O. G. Singleton and A. B. Greene shall serve as members of said board until their successors are elected as hereinafter provided and duly qualified, and F. O. Miller and A. J. Evans shall serve as members of said board until their successors are elected, which will be at the time of holding the next election within the city to fill the offices of mayor and council of said city in 1910, and that their successors shall be elected for a term of four (4) years from the date of said election. That O. G. Singleton and A. B. Greene shall serve as such commissioners until the election and qualification of their successors; said commissioners to be elected at the time of the holding of the regular election for mayor and council of said city in the year 1912, and said members of said board of water and light commissioners shall be elected for terms of four (4) years from the date of their several elections. Be it further enacted that the board of water and light commissioners shall be governed by the provision of the Act of the General Assembly, approved December 27th, 1890, as to the discharge of all their duties as such commissioners." The above subsection (i) of section 28A did not appear in the 1945 Act, as amended, but was extracted from section 3 of the 1909 Act. The section number 28A has been arbitrarily assigned to the 1965 Act by the editor.

                  Sec. 1-9. - Severability of parts of Code.

A supplement to this Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the mayor and city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be numbered so that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be prepared so that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
                  (b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.

For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
                  (4)  Change the term "this ordinance" or terms of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ___ to ___" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

Each day any violation of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
                  (b)  In addition to the penalties provided in subsection (a) of this section, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code or any ordinance shall be deemed a public nuisance, and may be abated by the city as provided by law, and each day that such condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense.

Persons who are elected, appointed and hired to serve the public are required to fulfill their public duties in a manner that is fair, faithful and honest in order to preserve the public trust. This requires that the government be conducted in an open manner, when appropriate, so that the public will have access to information about the decisions that are made that affect them. Public trust also requires that acts which are contrary to the public interest be defined and prohibited; ethical behavior be encouraged; and unethical behavior be discouraged in a process that is fundamentally fair.

                  Sec. 18-42. - Amendments to code. 
                  The electrical code adopted in this article is hereby amended and changed in the following respects. (Cited sections of the 1962 or later editions of the National Electrical Code shall be construed to refer to analogous sections of the current or revised editions). 
                  (1)  Article 110. Article 110 is hereby amended by adding the following sections: 
                  No meters shall be installed above the ground floor in any building, except by special permission. 
                  All service switches shall be mounted on a substantial wall of boards, not less than five feet from floor. All meters shall be six feet from the dial of the meter from the floor or ground. 
                  Concentric cable or entrance cable will be permitted only for service in houses and shall not be used as branch or subfeeder, except for ranges and water heaters. 
                  All feeder wires and branch circuits supplying current for elevators shall be computed on the basis of a two percent drop in voltage based on starting current of elevator motors having the same current characteristics which are supplied from one main feeder; such feeders may be computed on a two percent drop in voltage based on 75 percent of the combined starting current of all motors supplied by such feeder drops to be taken at the controller. The minimum size of the conductors to any individual elevator motor circuit shall be based on the starting current of the motor and in accordance with the code rating of the conductor. 
                  Open wiring on insulators or racks shall not be permitted in or on buildings, except by special permission. 
                  Attic fans and ventilating fans over 16 inches shall be equipped with a safety link or other approved device in the air stream causing the current to be disconnected or to close off the air stream when the temperature rises above 165 degrees Fahrenheit; the location of the control to meet with the approval of the department or agency of the city having jurisdiction. 
                  Any electrical wiring in public buildings which shall be installed shall be encased in metal conduits. In all nonpublic one- and two-story wood frame construction outside the fire limits, the use of copper type NM plastic-covered, grounded Romex is permitted. Aluminum service entrance cable may be used as needed for panels in multiple unit apartment structures of wood frame one- or two-story construction, provided such cable has a fuse disconnect at the meter location. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person to bridge a fuse gap in an ungrounded conductor in any manner whereby the conductor protected by such gap is fused above its rated capacity. 
                  All residents requiring six-branch circuits with provision for an electric range and dryer or water heater will require a 100-amp main. Only residences which have no provisions for an electric range, dryer or water heater will be accepted for 60-amp and No. 6 wire. 
                  No breakers for a range will be installed if, in the opinion of the inspector, a main and range panel can be installed. 
                  Each ranch-type house will have to be inspected as to which way to connect service wires to the main. In most cases, conduit will extend through the roof at the nearest point to the utility supply pole. Such conduit will be of from 1½-inch rigid up to four inches, with an approved weather head, and extending from 12 to 30 inches above the roof, with the height depending upon the location and required clearance. 
                  All mains must be encased in rigid conduit to the meter for any and all services, and no mains will be smaller than No. 6 wire and the neutral will be so marked by color (white). 
                  All nonmetallic sheathed cable shall be of the grounding type.

                  The maximum wattage permitted on No. 12 wire branch circuits shall be 1,500 watts. On branch circuits where the feed is over 100 feet to the first light, it shall be necessary to increase to the next larger size wire. These requirements apply to 110-volt branch circuits. 
                  In establishments used as beauty parlors, all branch circuits supplying current for receptacle outlets shall be on a size No. 12 or larger. No receptacle will be allowed on a circuit supplying current for ceiling or bracket outlets. Only two receptacle outlets shall be allowed on one circuit. All receptacles shall be not less than 15-amp capacity and of single gauge type. 
                  (3)  Article 230. Article 230 is hereby amended by adding the following sections: 
                  Service entrance wires in all buildings shall be run in rigid conduits. Service conduits are to be continuous from the point where the utility company's wires attach to building to meter [sic] and shall have not less than three feet of wire left at the outer end of service conduits. 
                  All services for ranch type houses, or low roofs where the service wire is less than ten feet, must extend above the roof 12 inches or more, depending upon the type of service wire that is to be used. 
                  All service entrance wires shall be brought out at the nearest point of accessibility to the utilities' service drop, except by special permission of the authority enforcing this code. 
                  All service entrances shall terminate in approved type fittings and be securely anchored so as to hold the service drop. 
                  Not more than two service entrances shall be run from any one service drop, except by permission of authority enforcing this code. 
                  Each separately metered installation of more than two branch circuits shall be controlled by an approved type safety switch, with fuses no larger than the capacity of the service wires. Meter service switches which control four or more circuits shall be not less than three-wire, 60-amp capacity. On all buildings or houses that require four or more circuits, the service shall be of three wires of a size not less than No. 6. 
                  All service entrances supplying five or more meters shall be provided with a main line breaker or switch. 
                  On installations requiring service switches larger than 400-amp capacity, an approved circuit breaker shall be installed. 
                  All service wires shall be of a size or capacity, within ten percent, to carry the full load rating of the service switch. Example: For a 100-amp service switch, the wire shall have a capacity of 90 amps. 
                  No service or main switch shall be allowed in kitchens, closets, bedrooms, bathrooms, under stairs or any other place that is not accessible at all times. All service or main switches shall be located on the ground or street level, if practical; if located elsewhere, an approved circuit breaker shall be used, controlled by an approved pushbutton on an accessible location. Service switches shall be enclosed, and if more than 600 volts enter the building, they shall be in a fireproof room. 
                  Where more than one meter or service switch is to be installed in the same location, each meter or switch shall be designated by a metal stamp or painted on the switch to show plainly the section or part of the building that it controls. 
                  In all cases requiring the relocation of service entrances, it shall be the duty of the contractor to supply the customer with a temporary jumper, pending final inspection. 
                  The customer will supply and install the attachment on the structure to which the utility commission will affix the service drop. The attachment will be made of a material of sufficient strength and anchored to the structure so as to support a pulling load of a minimum of 600 pounds. It will be the responsibility of the customer to maintain the attachment for the duration of the service. The customer will also assume all liability for any damages caused by or from a failure of the attachment. 
                  (4)  Article 250. Article 250 is hereby amended by adding the following section: 
                  No service or equipment ground shall be smaller than No. 6 wire.

                  (a)  It is the duty of the owner of every dwelling or other building or structure or property within the municipality to construct and maintain such dwelling or other building or structure, or property in conformance with applicable codes in force within the municipality, or such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling or other building or structure or property in violation of such codes or ordinances.

The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the owner and parties in interest; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and parties in interest that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction as determined by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain and at a place within the municipality where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days, nor more than 45 days after the filing of the complaint in the proper court. The owner and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for the hearing. 
                  (d)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling or other building or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause an order to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling or other building or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling or other building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling or other building or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling or other building or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling or other building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling or other building or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For the purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling or other building or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. § 40-39A-1 et seq., qualified building contractors or qualified building inspectors, without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the municipality. 
                  (e)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling or other building or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling or other building or structure to be repaired, altered or improved, or to be vacated and closed or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building or other dwelling or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (f)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing body are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (g)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (h)  The lien provided for in subsection (g) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring the repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(g). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including, specifically, O.C.G.A. § 48-4-1 et seq.; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing body. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (i)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-1 et seq. unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county governing authority. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien.

                  Sec. 38-73. - Principles and standards. 
                  (a)  Generally. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for land disturbing activities which are not excluded by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements and best management practices. 
                  (1)  Best management practices (BMPs) as set forth in subsection (c) of this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of BMPs shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f). As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where BMPs have not been properly designed, installed and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by the local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs) for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten NTUs for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install or maintain BMPs shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by the local issuing authority or the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)  Required practices. The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, BMPs, including sound conservation and engineering practices, to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut and fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. For the purposes of this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this article; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are not feasible, provided in any case, that such crossings must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediment and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; provided, however, that buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq. shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are complete. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by, or under contract with, the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The board shall adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial by the director of requests for variances. No variance shall be granted by the director which is not consistent with the criteria contained in such rules; provided, however, that, should the board fail to adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial of requests for variances by the director, the authority of the director to issue such variances shall be suspended until the board adopts such rules. 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board providing for notice to the division or local issuing authority of the location and extent of the piping and prescribed methodology for minimizing the impact of such piping and for measuring the volume of water discharged by the stream. Any such pipe must stop short of the downstream landowner's property, and the landowner must comply with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are complete. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by, or under contract with, the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The board shall adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial by the director of requests for variances. No variance shall be granted by the director which is not consistent with the criteria contained in such rules; provided, however, should the board fail to adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial of requests for variances by the director, the authority of the director to issue such variances shall be suspended until the board adopts such rules. 
                  (d)  Authority to adopt rules and regulations, ordinances and resolutions that exceed minimum requirements. Nothing contained in this article shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  Injury to property of another. The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this section or the terms of the permit. 
                  State Law reference— Similar provisions, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6. 
                  Sec. 38-74. - Application and permit process. 
                  (a)  Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding such tract. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority. However, the property owner is the only party that can obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  Permit required. No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the mayor and city council to perform such activity. 
                  (2)  Submission of applications; supporting data. The application for a permit shall be submitted to the mayor and city council and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan, with supporting data, as necessary. Such plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 38-73. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 38-72. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless the application is accompanied by copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. 
                  (3)  Fee. A fee in an amount as set by the mayor and city council shall be charged for each acre, or fraction thereof, in the project area. 
                  (4)  Review; approval or disapproval. Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 38-73 and bonding, if required as per this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. 
                  (5)  Violations of previous permits; bonds. 
                  a.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section or O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7, as amended within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  b.  The issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof, up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre, or fraction thereof, of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the issuing authority may call the bond, or any part thereof, to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. This subsection shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for a hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 38-73.

                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but, in any event, not later than 45 days after receipt by the issuing authority of a completed application, provided variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the issuing authority unless the erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved by the district and the issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by this section are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per this section are met, and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (4)  The permit may be suspended, revoked or modified by the issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon a finding that the holder or his successor in title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (5)  No permit shall be issued unless the applicant provides a statement by the tax collector certifying that all ad valorem taxes levied against the property and due and owing have been paid. 
                  Sec. 38-75. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The issuing authority will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, permit conditions or the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed.

                  (b)  Stop work orders. Upon notice from the issuing authority or its agent, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this article, or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, shall be immediately stopped. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in a land disturbing activity has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon such person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of this section 38-76. The issuing authority may call the bond, or any part thereof, to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person violating any provision of this article, permitting conditions or a stop work order shall be liable for a monetary penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day, a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding 60 days in jail, or both such fine and jail or work alternative. Each day during which the violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall constitute a separate violation. 
                  Sec. 38-77. - Administrative appeals; judicial review. 
                  (a)  The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the issuing authority within 30 days after receipt by the issuing authority of a written notice of appeal. 
                  (b)  Any person aggrieved by a decision or order of the issuing authority, after exhausting his administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal de novo to the superior court. 
                  Sec. 38-78. - Liability. 
                  (a)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law, nor impose any liability upon the issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (b)  The fact that a land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof, nor create a presumption, of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  (1)  Material changes. After designation by ordinance of an historic property or an historic district, no material change to the building, structure, site or work of art in such district shall be made without a certificate of appropriateness.

                  (2)  Disapproval. The commission shall disapprove the application if material changes do not meet the requirements of the guidelines established in section 50-4(e)(2) and an acceptable compromise cannot be reached with the property owner. 
                  a.  If the commission rejects an application, the commission shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after making such modifications, or appeal the ruling to the city council. 
                  b.  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (e)  Undue hardships. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications for certificates of appropriateness, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to such provisions, or to interpret the meaning of such provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship, provided such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of such provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgement, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. 
                  (f)  Notices; public hearings on applications.

                  (2)  Failure to act before deadline. Failure of the commission to act within such 45-day period shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (i)  Conformance. All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. Such conformance is to be determined by the appropriate city official with responsibility for building inspection. 
                  (j)  Commencement of construction; period of validity; renewal. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six months of the date of issuance of such certificate of appropriateness.

                  (m)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to exempt property owners from complying with existing city or county building and zoning codes, nor to prevent any property owner from making use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.

                  (a)  It is the policy of the city to encourage the preservation of historic buildings, structures, sites and areas which constitute a part of the historic fabric of the city or its respective neighborhood. 
                  (b)  Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of appropriateness to demolish or relocate a building or structure, or any part thereof, the commission shall review the circumstances and the condition of the building or structure, or part thereof, proposed for demolition or relocation and prepare a report of its findings. The report shall include factual data addressing the following criteria: 
                  (1)  Is the building of such architectural or historical interest that its removal would be detrimental to the public interest? 
                  (2)  Is the building of such old and unusual or uncommon design, texture and material that it could not be reproduced, or reproduced only with great difficulty? 
                  (3)  Would retention of the building help preserve and protect an historic place or area of historic interest in the city? 
                  (4)  Would retention of the building promote the general welfare by maintaining and increasing real estate values; generating business; creating new positions attracting tourists, students, writers, historians, artists and artisans; attracting new residents; encouraging study and interest in American history; or making the city or county a more desirable place in which to live? 
                  (c)  Based on the report as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, the commission shall: 
                  (1)  Determine that none of the criteria listed in subsection (b) of this section applies, and issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or relocation; 
                  (2)  Delay issuing the certificate of appropriateness for up to 90 days in order to allow persons or groups interested in historic preservation to work with the owner or applicant in an effort to preserve the structure or locate purchasers who would agree to preserve the building or structure in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; or 
                  (3)  Issue a certificate of appropriateness, if efforts at preservation prove unavailing. However, no certificate of appropriateness shall be issued for demolishing any structure listed specifically in the National Register of Historical Properties.

                  Sec. 50-8. - Certain changes and uses not prohibited. 
                  (a)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on an historic property or property in an historic district when such maintenance or repair does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, nor prevents any owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other laws, ordinances or regulations.

                  Sec. 62-12. - Social hosting. 
                  (a)  Findings and intent. The mayor and city council finds and declares as follows: 
                  (1)  In 2007, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report entitled "The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Underage Drinking," which can be found at http:/www.surgeongeneral.gov/topics/underagedrinking/calltoaction.pdf. (Surgeon General's Call to Action.) 
                  (2)  "Early alcohol consumption by some young people will result in an alcohol use disorder-that is, they will meet diagnostic criteria for either alcohol abuse or dependence." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 4.) 
                  (3)  "A higher percentage of youth in 8th, 10th and 12th grades used alcohol in the month prior to being surveyed than used tobacco or marijuana, the illicit drug most commonly used by adolescents." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 5.) 
                  (4)  Various surveys have found that: approximately ten percent of children who are nine to ten years old have started drinking alcoholic beverages; nearly 33 percent of youth start drinking alcoholic beverages before the age of 13; more than ten percent of youth who are 12 to 13 years old and over 33 percent of youth who are 14 to 15 years old reported drinking a whole alcoholic beverage in the year before they were surveyed, and the peak years of alcohol initiation are when youth are in 7th and 8th grades. (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 6.) 
                  (5)  While adolescents typically drink alcohol beverages less often than adults, when they do drink alcohol beverages, adolescents tend to drink more alcoholic beverages at each event than adults. (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at pages 6-7.) 
                  (6)  Persons who are less than the age of 21 often possess or consume alcoholic beverages at social parties or gatherings held at or on property under control of a person who either has provided the alcoholic beverages or who knows or reasonably should know of such conduct, but fails to take steps to prevent it. 
                  (7)  "Annually, about 5,000 people under age 21 die from alcohol-related injuries involving underage drinking." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 10.) 
                  (8)  Underage drinking "plays a significant role in risky sexual behavior, including unwanted, unintended and unprotected sexual activity, and sex with multiple partners. Such behavior increases the risk of unplanned pregnancy and for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 10.) 
                  (9)  Underage drinking "increases the risk of physical and sexual assault." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 10.) 
                  (10)  Underage drinking "can cause a range of physical consequences, from hangovers to death from alcohol poisoning." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 11.) 
                  (11)  Underage drinking "can cause alterations in the structure and function of the developing brain, which continues to mature into the mid to late twenties and may have consequences reaching far beyond adolescence." (Surgeon General's Cal to Action, at page 11.) 
                  (12)  Underage drinking "causes secondhand effects that can put others at risk. Loud and unruly behavior, property destruction, unintentional injuries, violence, and even death because of underage alcohol use afflict innocent parties. For instance, about 45 percent of people who die in car crashes involving a drinking driver under the age of 21 are people other than the driver." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 11.) 
                  (13)  There is concern about underage persons obtaining and consuming alcoholic beverages at functions under the control of adults who know or should know of such conduct but fail to stop it. 
                  (14)  This body finds that adults who knowingly allow underage drinking on property they control should be held responsible and accountable. 
                  (15)  Too frequently, adults who are aware that underage drinking is illegal allow underage drinking at property they control knowing that they are not breaking the law so long as they don't directly provide the alcohol to minors. This body finds that this is a gap in the current laws that must be eliminated. 
                  (16)  Law enforcement agency responses to disturbances involving underage consumption of alcoholic beverages at parties or gatherings at or on private residences or other private property frequently require the use of extensive public resources. Further, when law enforcement personnel respond to such disturbances it limits their ability to respond to other service calls in the community, thereby placing the community at increased risk. Law enforcement is not currently reimbursed for their expenses when called to a party or gathering at or on private residence or other private property. 
                  (17)  The prohibitions found in this section are reasonable and expected to deter the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons under the age of 21 by holding responsible persons who encourage, are aware of, or should be aware of the illegal conduct, yet fail to take steps to prevent it. In addition, the revenue received, after cost reimbursement to the responding law enforcement agency, will be directed toward law enforcement strategies and prevention programs. 
                  (b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

                  Sec. 90-163. - Water resource districts established. 
                  (a)  The city's water resource districts shall include the following: 
                  (1)  Groundwater Recharge Area District. 
                  (2)  Wetlands Protection District. 
                  (b)  The boundaries of the water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designated as the "water resource districts," and are included as part of the city's official zoning map, which is on file in the county zoning administrator's office, located in the county courthouse. 
                  (Ord. of 12-20-2001, § 2) 
                  Sec. 90-164. - Groundwater recharge area district. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics, thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of the groundwater recharge area district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. 
                  (c)  Delineation. The Groundwater Recharge Area District is delineated in accordance with the state department of natural resources' Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium or low, based on the state Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Such maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this division. 
                  (d)  Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the groundwater recharge area protection district. Additional requirements for specific uses are as follows: 
                  (1)  New above the ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  (2)  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within a: 
                  a.  High pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.  Medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15-acre-feet in size; and 
                  c.  Low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in size. 
                  As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay, having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 by 10 -7 cm/sec (centimeters per second), or other criteria established by the National Resource and Conservation Service. 
                  (3)  New homes served by septic tank/drainfield systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on table MT-1 of the department of human resources' (DHR) Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (referred to in this section as "DHR table MT-1").

                  a.  150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated, based on application of DHR table MT-1, if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.  125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated, based on application of DHR table MT-1, if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
                  c.  110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated, based on application of DHR table MT-1, if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  (4)  New manufactured home parks served by septic tank/drainfield systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on table MT-2 of the department of human resources' (DHR) Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (referred to in this section as "DHR table MT-2"). The minimums set forth in DHR table MT-2 may be increased further, based on consideration of other factors set forth in sections A through F of the DHR manual. 
                  a.  150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated, based on application of DHR table MT-2, if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.  125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated, based on application of DHR table MT-2, if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; and 
                  c.  110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size or space size calculated, based on application of DHR table MT-2, if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  (5)  No construction may proceed on a building or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the state department of human resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management (referred to in this section as the "DHR manual) and subsections (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section. 
                  (6)  New facilities which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, excluding underground storage tanks, and in amounts 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and any local fire prevention code requirements. 
                  (7)  Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility. 
                  (e)  Exemptions. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived is exempt from the minimum lot size requirements contained in subsections (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section.

                  Sec. 90-165. - Wetlands protection district. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature, and provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study; and recreational opportunities. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of the wetlands protection district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas. 
                  (c)  Delineation. 
                  (1)  The wetlands protection district is hereby established, which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. Such map shall be referred to as the "generalized wetlands map" and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this division, together with all explanatory matter on, and attached to, such map. 
                  (2)  The generalized wetlands map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this section does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (d)  Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use, except as identified in subsection (e) of this section, shall be allowed within the wetlands protection district without a development permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' determination shall be required. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued. 
                  (e)  Permitted uses. The uses set forth in this subsections (e)(1) through (6) of this section are permitted by right within the wetlands protection district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and, provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging as provided in this section. Such activities are exempt from regulations of section 404 of the Clean Water Act, provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual section 404 permit; however, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances. 
                  (1)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (2)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or United States in such a way that would require an individual section 404 permit. 
                  (3)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (4)  Cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (5)  Pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected; soil profiles are not disturbed; and approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (f)  Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in the wetlands protection district: 
                  (1)  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous wastes or other contaminants. 
                  (2)  Hazardous or sanitary landfills.

                  (a)  No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained unless the water supply is protected as required by state law and regulations, and this division. Service of water to any premises may be discontinued if any backflow preventer required by this division or state law is not installed, tested and maintained; if any backflow preventer has been removed or bypassed; or if any unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. Applicable requirements for backflow prevention will be complied with prior to restoration of service. 
                  (b)  Any customer system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the utility commission to determine whether cross connections or other health hazards, plumbing hazards or pollutional hazards exist. 
                  (c)  An approved backflow preventer shall be installed on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being serviced, but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line, wherever the following conditions exist: 
                  (1)  In the case of a premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not, or may not be, of a safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable to the director as an additional source, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow preventer in the service line. 
                  (2)  In the case of a premises on which any industrial fluid or other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from such premises by installing an approved backflow preventer in the service line. 
                  (3)  In the case of a premises having internal cross connections that cannot be permanently controlled, or having intricate plumbing and piping arrangements, or having no entry making all portions of the premises readily accessible for inspection purposes, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow preventer in the service line. 
                  (d)  There shall be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow preventer located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. 
                  (e)  The type of protective device required in any case shall depend upon the degree of hazard, which shall be determined as follows: 
                  (1)  In the case of any premises on which there is an auxiliary water supply, the public water system shall be protected by an approved airgap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. 
                  (2)  In the case of any premises on which there is water or any substance which would be objectionable, but not hazardous, to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly. 
                  (3)  In the case of any premises on which there is any material dangerous to health, which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved airgap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. Examples of premises where such conditions exist are sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants. 
                  (4)  In the case of any premises on which there are uncontrolled cross connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved airgap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer installed at the service connection. 
                  (5)  In the case of any premises on which, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete inplant cross connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer installed on each service to the premises. 
                  (6)  In the case of any premises on which there is no known pollutional or contaminant hazard, the public water system shall be protected by an approved residential dual check valve installed at the service connection. 
                  (f)  Any backflow preventer required in this section shall be a model and size approved by the director and manufactured in full conformity with the standards established in the latest edition of the Standard Plumbing Code. 
                  (g)  If, in the judgment of the director, an approved backflow preventer, other than a residential dual check type backflow preventer, should be installed at the customer's water service connection for the safety of the customer's water system, the director shall give notice, in writing, to such customer to install the necessary backflow preventer at a specific location on his premises. The customer shall immediately install such device at his own expense, and failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install, have tested and maintain such device shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. Turn-off and turn-on fees must be paid by the customer prior to restoration of service. 
                  (h)  It shall be the duty of the customer at any premises where backflow preventers, other than the residential dual check valve, are installed, to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once each year or at more frequent intervals as required by the director. Such inspections and tests shall be made at the expense of the customer, and shall be performed in a timely manner by a certified tester approved by the director. The customer shall be notified by the director in advance when the tests are to be undertaken, and may witness the tests, if so desired. Any device found to be defective shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the customer. Records of such tests, repairs and overhauls shall be kept by the customer and made available to the director. Residential dual check valves installed by the utility commission will be maintained by the utility commission, at its expense. 
                  (i)  Any backflow preventer installed before the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived which does not meet the requirements of this section, but which was an approved device for the purposes described in this section at the time of installation, and which has been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection (h) of this section, be excluded from the requirements of this division if the director determines that it will adequately protect the utility system. Whenever such an existing device is moved from its location, or requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the director finds that the maintenance thereof constitutes a health hazard, such device shall be replaced by an approved backflow preventer. 
                  (j)  Residential dual check type backflow preventers shall be installed at the discretion of the director on new and existing services, and the customers shall pay all applicable fees for such devices.

The manhole shall be installed by the owner, at such owner's expense, and shall be maintained by such owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
                  (i)  All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples. 
                  (j)  No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the commission and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the commission for treatment, subject to payment by the industrial concern for such treatment.

                  FORT VALLEY UTILITY COMMISSION GREASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  Adopted July 9, 2007 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of this program is to minimize the introduction of fats, oils, and greases into the city utility commission wastewater collection system by non-domestic kitchen facilities. The main components of the program are the proper sizing, installation, and maintenance of grease interceptors. The administrative and inspection requirements of food service facilities are established herein as well. 
                  (b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  FVUC means the Fort Valley Utility Commission. 
                  Domestic wastewater means wastewater from sanitary fixtures such as toilets and urinals. 
                  Food service facility means any facility, which cuts, cooks, bakes, prepares, or serves food, or which disposes of food related wastes. 
                  Garbage grinder means a device that shreds or grinds up solid or semisolid waste materials into smaller portions for discharge into the sanitary sewer. 
                  Grease means a material composed primarily of fats, oil, and grease from animal or vegetable sources. The terms "fats," "oil," and "grease" shall be deemed as grease by definition. The term "grease" may also include petroleum-based products. 
                  Hauler or transporter means one who transfers waste from the site of a user to an approved site for disposal or treatment. The hauler is responsible for assuring that all federal, state and local regulations are followed regarding waste transport. 
                  Interceptor or separator or trap means a device so constructed as to separate, trap, and hold fats, oils, greases, sand, and grit substances from the wastewater discharged by a facility to prevent these substances from entering the sanitary sewer. 
                  Under-sink or inline grease trap means a device placed under or in close proximity to sinks or other facilities likely to discharge grease in an attempt to separate, trap or hold, oil and grease substances to prevent their entry into the sanitary sewer. 
                  User means a source of discharge to the sanitary sewer of the city utility commission. 
                  Waste or wastewater means the liquid and water-carried domestic or industrial wastes from dwellings, commercial establishments, industrial facilities, and institutions, whether treated or untreated, contributed to the sanitary sewer. 
                  (c)  General criteria. 
                  (1)  Installation requirements for new food service facilities. All proposed or newly remodeled food service facilities inside the city utility commission wastewater service area shall be required to install an approved, properly operated and maintained grease interceptor. All interceptor units shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility building unless the user can demonstrate to the city utility commission that an outdoor interceptor would not be feasible. All interceptor units shall be of the type and capacity approved by the city utility commission. 
                  (2)  Requirements for existing food service facilities. All existing food service facilities inside the city utility commission wastewater service area are expected to conduct their operations in such a manner that grease is captured on the user's premises and then properly disposed. Existing food service facilities will be handled under the city utility commission's grease management program in the following manner: 
                  a.  The city utility commission will periodically inspect each food service facility on an as-needed basis to assure that each facility is complying with the intent of the grease control program. The as-needed inspection shall be determined by the city utility commission. 
                  b.  Each food service facility in the vicinity of any problem areas will be inspected. The facilities' grease control practices and the adequacy of their grease control interceptor/equipment will be assessed. Maintenance records will also be reviewed. 
                  c.  Following the inspections, the city utility commission will send written notice to the inspected food service facilities, containing a summary of the policy requirements, and the results of the inspection. The inspections will typically result in one of the following actions: 
                  1.  Facilities equipped with an appropriate and adequately sized grease interceptor who are meeting the intent of the grease management program through effective grease control practices will be commended for their compliance. 
                  2.  After notice and an opportunity to be heard, facilities not in compliance shall be required to develop and submit to the city utility commission a proposed plan designed to achieve compliance through improved housekeeping and/or increased maintenance and pumping of the existing grease interceptor/equipment. 
                  3.  Facilities that are not successful in achieving compliance with the intent of the grease management program through improved housekeeping and increased maintenance and pumping of the existing grease interceptor/equipment will be required to install the necessary interceptor/equipment to bring the facility into compliance. 
                  (3)  Prohibited discharges. Domestic wastewater shall not be discharged to the grease interceptor unless specifically approved, in writing, by the city utility commission. 
                  (4)  Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease interceptor. 
                  (5)  Location. Each grease interceptor shall be installed and connected so that it is easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at anytime. Grease interceptors required under this article shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility. The best location is in an area outside of an exterior wall, but upstream from the domestic wastewater drain lines. A grease interceptor may not be installed inside any part of a building unless approved in writing by the city utility commission. The user bears the burden of demonstrating that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible. 
                  (d)  Design criteria. 
                  (1)  Construction of interceptors. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the city plumbing standards and outdoor units shall have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All alternative grease removal devices or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the city utility commission. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology. 
                  (2)  Access. Outdoor grease interceptors shall be provided with two manholes terminating 1-inch above finished grade with cast iron frame and cover. All grease interceptors shall be designed and installed to allow for complete access for inspection and maintenance of inner chambers as well as viewing and sampling of wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer. 
                  (3)  Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may exist, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing capacity (example: vehicular traffic in parking or driving areas). 
                  (4)  Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to the grease interceptor shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the interceptor. The inlet pipe bottom tee branch shall extend one foot below liquid level. The outlet pipe bottom tee branch shall be submerged to two-thirds of the liquid depth. Each grease interceptor shall have only one inlet and one outlet pipe. 
                  (5)  Interceptor sizing. 
                  a.  Outdoor grease interceptors shall not have a capacity of less than 1,500 gallons nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gallons. No matter what the calculated capacity using the following formulas, the minimum interceptor size shall be 1,500 gallons. If the calculated capacity using one of the following formulas exceeds 3,000 gallons, then multiple units in series shall be installed. The size of a grease interceptor shall be approximated by the following methods and grease interceptor size shall be the larger of the two results. 
                  1.  Interceptor capacity (gallons) = (S) × (25) × (Hr/12). 
                  S = Number of Seats  Hr = Maximum hours of daily operation  (Include preparation and clean up) 
                  2.  Interceptor capacity (gallons) = (Sum of fixture flows) × (20). 

                   
                  b.  Under-sink or in-line grease interceptor requirements shall meet Plumbing and Drainage Institute Standard PDI-G101: 

                   
                  c.  Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by the city utility commission. The city utility commission reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula. 
                  (e)  Grease interceptor maintenance. 
                  (1)  Pumping. All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is strictly prohibited. 
                  (2)  Pumping frequency. Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptors must be pumped/cleaned out completely a minimum of once every month. Grease interceptors may need to be pumped more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system. Pumping frequency may be extended past the minimum period if it can be demonstrated by the user and approved by the city utility commission. 
                  (3)  Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed the city utility commission's maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 33 percent of the total depth of the trap, the city utility commission will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven days from receipt of the order to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply. 
                  (4)  Disposal of interceptor pumped material. All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed at a facility approved by the city utility commission to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumped material be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer collection system. 
                  (5)  Additives. Any additives placed into the grease interceptor or building discharge line system on a constant, regular, or scheduled basis shall be reported to the city utility commission. Such additives shall include, but are not be limited to, commercially available bacteria or other additives designed to absorb, consume, or treat fats, oils, and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as an alternative technology or a substitution for maintenance procedures required herein. 
                  (6)  Chemical treatment. Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, enzymes, acids, and other chemicals designed to dissolve, purge, or remove grease shall not be allowed to enter the grease interceptor. 
                  (f)  Administrative requirements. 
                  (1)  Initial data acquisition. All food service facilities will be asked to complete a data sheet to establish the grease interceptor database. A copy of the form has been attached to this document as appendix A. The city utility commission database will be updated with additional or modified information after each yearly inspection. 
                  (2)  Administrative fees. No fee will be charged for an annual inspection by the city utility commission. However, if the user's grease interceptor is not in compliance with this section, a $100.00 re-inspection fee will be charged for each inspection thereafter until compliance is achieved. 
                  (3)  Inspection and entry. Authorized personnel of the city utility commission, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall have the right to enter upon all properties subject to this program, at any time and without prior notification, for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, testing or record review, as part of this program. 
                  (4)  Record retention and reporting. All users must keep a record of any cleaning or maintenance of their grease interceptor. The following records must be kept on-site at the food service facility for a period of two years: 
                  a.  Manifests are required for all grease interceptors and shall contain the following information: 
                  1.  Food service facility (generator) information, including name, address, volume pumped, date and time of pumping, and generator signature verifying the information; 
                  2.  Transporter information, including company name, address, license plate number, permit number, driver name, and driver signature verifying transporter information; and 
                  3.  Receiving information, including facility name, address, date and time of receiving, EPD permit number, and signature verifying receipt of the waste. 
                  4.  Manifests must be mailed, faxed, or electronically submitted to the city utility commission wastewater superintendent's office within 14 days of interceptor maintenance. 
                  5.  A manifest may not be required for under-sink or inline grease interceptors, if user can demonstrate to the city utility commission a valid reason not to use one. 
                  b.  Maintenance logs are required for all under-sink and in-line interceptors. This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped or cleaned, hauler, disposal site, and signature. Log shall be kept in a conspicuous location for inspection. This log shall be made immediately available to health officer or the city utility commission representative upon request. See Appendix B for an example. 
                  (g)  Enforcement. Enforcement of these regulations shall be the responsibility of the city utility commission (FVUC) wastewater department. Failure to comply with this program will be grounds for penalty imposition and/or discontinuance of service. Additionally, failure to comply may result in health officer revoking food service permit and/or the city revoking business license.

                  (3)  Appendix C - Grease management enforcement procedure. 
                  GREASE MANAGEMENT ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE 
                  A.  Enforcement procedures. Generally, all violations identified by the city utility commission are reviewed, evaluated, and addressed by the appropriate enforcement response. The majority of enforcement actions begin with issuance of an initial notice of violation. This letter describes the nature of the violation and informs the user that any addition violations may result in an escalated enforcement action. Once the user has been notified of a violation or has knowledge of a condition which is a violation, the user may be allowed up to 30 days to correct the noncompliance before escalation of the enforcement process occurs. This 30-day period applies only to the initial violation. Any violations occurring after this period will be evaluated according to plan procedures. Emergency conditions require immediate correction of noncompliance. 
                  B.  Enforcement remedies available to the city utility commission. The following list is arranged from least severe to most severe: 
                  1.  Verbal Warning (VW) or Letter of Warning (LW). 
                  2.  Site Visit or Re-inspection (SV). 
                  3.  Notice of Violation (NOV). 
                  4.  Schedule of Compliance (SOC). 
                  5.  Termination of Discharge (TOD). 
                  6.  Water Supply Severance (WSS). 
                  7.  Judicial Enforcement Remedies or Litigation (LIT). 
                  For further information or definitions of these enforcement remedies, consult the city utility commission's attorney. 
                  C.  Staff responsibilities. 
                  1.  The wastewater superintendent oversees all collection and screening of data, organization of enforcement actions, review of actions taken, and general management of enforcement response procedures. He is authorized to administer enforcement remedies from verbal warnings to increased self-monitoring. 
                  2.  Enforcement will be in conformance with ordinance. 
                  D.  Grease enforcement response guide (See section B for key to abbreviations). 

                   
                  E.  Enforcement guidance and timeframes. 
                  1.  Whenever a notice of violation is issued that requires a response and the user fails to respond, the next level of enforcement will be taken. 
                  2.  Enforcement responses may be escalated as needed and the city utility commission is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any non-compliant user. 
                  3.  The city utility commission may charge any user for recovery of costs incurred. 
                  4.  Time frames for enforcement responses: 
                  a.  All violations will be identified and documented within seven days of receiving compliance information. 
                  b.  Initial enforcement responses involving contact with industrial user and requesting information on corrective or preventative actions will occur within 30 days of violation detection. 
                  c.  Follow up actions for continuing or recurring violations will be taken within 60 days of the initial enforcement response. For all continuing violations, the response will include a compliance schedule. 
                  d.  Violations that threaten health, property or environmental quality are considered emergencies and will receive immediate responses such as halting the discharge of the user.

This information is required to be provided to the consumer reporting agency when: 
                  (1)  The city is able to form a reasonable belief that the consumer report relates to the consumer about whom the city requested the report; 
                  (2)  The city establishes a continuing relation with the consumer; and 
                  (3)  The city regularly and in the ordinary course of business provides information to the consumer reporting agency from which it received the notice of address discrepancy. 
                  (b)  Such information shall be provided to the consumer reporting agency as part of the information regularly provided by the city to such agency for the reporting period in which the city establishes a relationship with the customer.

                  Sec. A. - Streets. 
                  (1)  Right-of-way. The dedication of right-of-way, measured from lot line to lot line, shall be as shown on the major street plan of the city and shall meet the following standards: 

                   
                  (2)  Intersections. Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, but in no case at any angle of less than 75 degrees. 
                  (3)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be allowed. 
                  (4)  Additional width on existing streets. Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall be required to dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the above minimum street width requirements. 
                  (a)  The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street. 
                  (b)  When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the centerline of the existing roadway, shall be provided. 
                  (5)  Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets, designed to be permanently closed at one end, shall be no longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a radius at the outside of the right-of-way of at least 50 feet. 
                  (6)  Access. The planning commission may control access to major streets by requiring all lots to face and have access only to other streets. 
                  (7)  Coordinated street system. Where, in the opinion of the planning commission, it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property. Where it is deemed necessary by the planning commission, such temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turnaround having a roadway diameter of at least 80 feet. 
                  (8)  Private streets and reserve strips. There shall be no private streets platted in any subdivision in the city.

                  (9)  Street names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named, shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case shall the name for proposed streets duplicate or be sufficiently similar to existing street names, irrespective of the use of the suffix "street," "avenue," "boulevard," "drive," "place," or "court." 
                  (10)  Tangents. A tangent at least 100 feet in length shall be introduced between reverse curves. 
                  (11)  Relation to adjoining street system. The proposed street system of the subdivision shall extend existing streets in adjacent developments at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width set forth in this section.

                  (1)  Minimum size. Lots served by a public sewerage system shall meet the minimum requirements of the zoning district in which they are located but in no case shall they be less than 7,200 square feet in lot area or have a lot frontage of less than 60 feet. Lots not served by a public sewerage system shall be not less than 75 feet wide at the building line nor less than 15,000 square feet in area. Greater area may be required for private sewage disposal if factors of drainage, soil condition or other conditions are considered to be potential health problems. The planning commission may require data from percolation tests to be submitted as a basis for passing on subdivisions dependent upon septic tanks as a means of sewage disposal. 
                  (2)  Building setback lines. The minimum depth of building setback lines from the street shall not be less than 30 feet and, in the case of corner lots, 15 feet from the side street. However, if greater setbacks are required by the zoning ordinance of the city as now or hereafter adopted, these shall be provided. 
                  (3)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and larger in area to permit the building setback line outlined above. 
                  Sec. D. - Easements. 
                  Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided where necessary for utilities or drainage. 
                  Sec. E. - Public sites and open spaces. 
                  When proposed park, playground, school or other public use shown on the comprehensive plan is located in whole or in part in a subdivision, the planning commission may require the dedication of such open space within the subdivision.

                  Sec. A. - Enforcing officer. 
                  The provisions of this article shall be administered and enforced by the city engineer. The city engineer's duties shall include: 
                  (1)  Receiving subdivision plats; 
                  (2)  In cooperation with the planning commission, reviewing and approving subdivision plats; 
                  (3)  Inspecting subdivisions for compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable city ordinances. 
                  Cross reference— Officers and employees, § 2-91 et seq. 
                  Sec. B. - Procedure for plat approval. 
                  The procedure for developing and obtaining approval of a subdivision plat consists of three separate steps. These are: 
                  (1)  Preliminary approval. The developer shall prepare a preliminary plat as specified in this ordinance and obtain approval of it prior to the making of any street improvements or installation of utilities. Three copies of this plat shall be submitted to the city engineer at least ten days prior to the regular meeting date of the planning commission. Within 30 days after submission, the planning commission shall review the plat and indicate its approval, disapproval (listing reasons), or approval subject to listed modifications as a basis for the preparation of the final plat. Failure to act within 30 days shall be deemed approval of the preliminary plat unless the developer agrees to an extension of time. Approval of the preliminary plat shall lapse unless the final plat is submitted within one year from the date of preliminary approval. After action by the planning commission, copies of the preliminary plat shall be distributed as follows: developer—one copy; city engineer—one copy; planning commission—one copy. 
                  (2)  Physical improvement of subdivision. After preliminary approval of the plat has been given by the planning commission, the developer may then proceed to grade the streets and install all improvements required by this ordinance and any other applicable city ordinance. In lieu of the completion of all improvements before submitting a final plat and requesting final approval by the planning commission, the developer may post with the city a bond or certified check, in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it, providing for a securing to the city the actual construction and installation of such improvements and utilities within a period specified by the planning commission and expressed in the bond. 
                  (3)  Final approval. The developer shall submit an original tracing drawn in black indelible drawing ink and three copies of the final plat of the subdivision, or that portion thereof to be recorded and developed, to the city engineer, who will check and certify that monuments and completion of (or payment for) improvements are satisfactory. Such plat shall be submitted not less than ten days prior to the regular meeting date of the planning commission. Within 30 days after submission, the planning commission shall review the final plat and approve or disapprove it (listing reasons for disapproval). Failure to act within 30 days will be deemed approval of the final plat unless the developer agrees to an extension of this time. The tracing with certifications shall be returned to the developer, plus one copy for filing with the clerk of the superior court of Peach County. The remaining two copies shall be retained, one by the city engineer and one by the planning commission. 
                  Sec. C. - Enforcement provisions. 
                  (1)  Penalties for transferring lots in unapproved subdivisions. The owner or agent of the owner of any land to be subdivided within the city who transfers or sells or agrees to sell or negotiate to sell such land by reference to or exhibition of or by other use of a plat of subdivision of such land before such plat has been approved by the planning commission and recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of Peach County shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as provided by law; and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transfer shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties. The city, through its attorney or other designated official may enjoin such transfer or sale or agreement by appropriate action. 
                  (2)  Erection of buildings. From and after March 16, 1961, no building permit shall be issued for and no building or other structure shall be erected on any lot within the city unless the street giving access to the lot upon which said building is proposed to be placed shall be accepted or opened as, or shall have otherwise received the legal status of, a public street prior to that time, or unless such street corresponds in its location and line with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by said planning commission or with a street located and accepted by the city. Any building erected in violation of this section shall be deemed an unlawful structure, and the city engineer, the building inspector, or city attorney or any other designated official of the city may bring appropriate action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed. 
                  ARTICLE V. - AMENDMENTS 

                  Sec. A. - Procedure. 
                  This article may be amended from time to time, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall first have been submitted to the planning commission for review and recommendations. The planning commission shall have 30 days within which to submit a report. If the planning commission fails to submit a report within the 30-day period, it shall be deemed to have approved the proposed amendment. 
                  Sec. B. - Public hearing required. 
                  Before enacting an amendment to this subdivision ordinance, the city council shall hold a public hearing thereon; at least 15 days' notice of the time and place of which shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
                  ARTICLE VI. - LEGAL STATUS PROVISIONS 

                  Sec. A. - Conflict with other laws. 
                  When the provisions of this article specify more restrictive standards than required by any other ordinance, the requirements of this ordinance shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other ordinance require more restrictive standards, the provisions of such ordinance shall govern. 
                  Sec. B. - Validity. 
                  Should any section or provision of this ordinance be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
                  Sec. C. - Effective date. 
                  This ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after its adoption; the public welfare demanding it.

                  [Sec.] I. - Purposes. 
                  This ordinance is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the city of telecommunications providers and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the City of Fort Valley so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonable discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the city as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this ordinance shall: 
                  (a)  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the city; 
                  (b)  Protect the city's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities; 
                  (c)  Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
                  (d)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennas failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas; 
                  (e)  Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; 
                  (f)  Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and 
                  (g)  Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use. 
                  (Ord. of 4-19-2001)

                  (Ord. of 4-19-2001) 
                  [Sec.] V. - Preferred and disfavored location sites. 
                  A.  Preferred location sites. 
                  1.  Collocation sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this ordinance and collocation sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the inspector or the governing authority to be visually obtrusive. 
                  2.  Publicly used structures. Publicly used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flagpoles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches. 
                  3.  Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations, particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility. 
                  4.  Mixed use buildings in high density districts. Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites. 
                  B.  Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential structure or site or multifamily duplex shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities. 
                  (Ord. of 4-19-2001) 
                  [Sec.] VI. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities. 
                  A.  General requirements for all telecommunication facilities. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance. 
                  1.  Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the inspector. 
                  2.  Regulatory compliance. 
                  a.  All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 
                  b.  Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  3.  Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. 
                  4.  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the inspector may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  5.  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this ordinance are met. 
                  6.  Visual impact. 
                  a.  Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background. 
                  c.  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. 
                  d.  Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  e.  Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
                  7.  Landscaping. 
                  a.  Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property. 
                  b.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  c.  The inspector may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the inspector. 
                  8.  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street. 
                  9.  Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
                  a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility. 
                  b.  Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 
                  10.  Lot size and setbacks. 
                  a.  The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities; provided, however, that the inspector may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby. 
                  i.  Telecommunications towers must be setback a distance equal to 110 percent of the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure. 
                  ii.  Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
                  iii.  Telecommunications facilities must be setback from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section VII. 
                  b.  For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot-high antenna and supporting structure requires [a] ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact. 
                  B.  Additional requirements for towers. 
                  1.  Site location and development shall preserve the pre-existing character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. 
                  2.  Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 
                  3.  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  4.  Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable. 
                  5.  When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be setback from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to 100 percent of its total height. 
                  6.  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district. 
                  7.  Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter. 
                  8.  Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access. 
                  9.  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
                  (Ord. of 4-19-2001) 
                  [Sec.] VII. - Application procedures. 
                  A.  General application requirements for all building and special use permits.

                  2.  Five-year plan and site inventory. Each application shall include a five-year facilities plan and site inventory including the following: 
                  a.  A list of all existing, existing to be upgraded or replaced, and proposed telecommunications facility sites within the city limits and within one mile of the city limits and a map showing these sites. The list must include the following information for each site: 
                  i.  Street address; 
                  ii.  Assessor's block and lot or other applicable ad valorem tax identification number; 
                  iii.  Zoning district; 
                  iv.  Type of building (commercial, residential, mixed use) and number of stories; 
                  v.  The number of antennas and base transceiver stations per site and the location and type of antenna installation (stand alone rooftop, building facade, etc.) and location of the base transceiver station installations; 
                  vi.  The height from grade to the top of the antenna installation; and 
                  vii.  The radio frequency range in megahertz, the wattage output of the equipment and effective radiated power. 
                  b.  If the applicant does not know specific future tower and antenna site locations but does know of areas where telecommunications facilities will be needed within the next five years to provide service, the applicant shall list the assessor's blocks contained within the anticipated geographic service area and identify each geographic service area with a number that will correspond to the future telecommunication facility site. 
                  3.  Additional information requirements for towers. 
                  a.  If the proposed site is zoned residential and there are alternative sites in business or industrial districts, applicants must justify why those alternate sites have not been proposed. The inspector will review with special care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The inspector shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site. 
                  b.  Applicants must identify all existing towers and all towers for which there are applications currently on file with the inspector. Applicants must provide evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna. If collocation on any such towers would result in less visual impact than the visual impact of the proposed tower, applicants must justify why such collocation is not being proposed. If collocation on any such tower would increase negative visual impact, then the applicant must so state and demonstrate. The inspector will review with special care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The inspector shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site. 
                  c.  In all zones, applicants must demonstrate that they cannot provide personal wireless communication service without the use of a telecommunications tower. 
                  d.  The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number and types of antennas. The applicant shall provide a drawing for each tower showing existing and proposed antennas locations. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The inspector shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means. 
                  e.  The applicant must provide a utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power lines impacting the proposed tower site. 
                  4.  [ Other information. ] The applicant must provide any other information which may be requested by the inspector to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed telecommunications facility. 
                  B.  Expedited review for building permits only. When a telecommunications facility will be a use as of right pursuant to section IV of this ordinance and requires only a building permit and design review before it may be erected, the inspector will expedite review of the application and render a decision on the application within 14 business days after receipt of a complete application. 
                  C.  Special use permits. 
                  1.  A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the inspector and handled in accordance with the special use permit provisions of the Code of Ordinances. A special use permit may be issued under this section provided it is determined that all of the requirements of section VI have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties. 
                  2.  The granting [of] a special use permit may result in the imposition of additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties. 
                  (Ord. of 4-19-2001) 
                  [Sec.] VIII. - Collocation. 
                  Applicant and owner shall allow other future personal wireless service companies, including public and quasipublic agencies, using functionally equivalent personal wireless technology to collocate antennas, equipment and facilities on a telecommunications facility unless specific technical constraints prohibit said collocation. Applicant and other personal wireless carriers shall provide a mechanism for the construction and maintenance of shared facilities and infrastructure and shall provide for equitable sharing of cost in accordance with industry standards. 
                  (Ord. of 4-19-2001) 
                  [Sec.] IX. - Appeals. 
                  Appeals from any decision of the inspector may be taken by any person aggrieved or any official of the city affected by the decision of the inspector. Such right of appeal shall be the same as that afforded with any other zoning matter. Any decision denying a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications facility shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence in a written record. Any decision by the governing body denying or approving a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications facility shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence in a written record. 
                  (Ord. of 4-19-2001) 
                  [Sec.] X. - Nuisances. 
                  Telecommunications facilities, including, without limitation, power source, ventilation and cooling, shall be operated at all times within the limits of the City of Fort Valley, and shall not be operated so as to cause the generation of heat that adversely affects a building occupant and shall not be maintained or operated in such a manner as to be a nuisance. 
                  (Ord. of 4-19-2001) 
                  [Sec.] XI. - Removal of antennas and towers. 
                  All telecommunications facilities shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such facilities. If upon inspection by the inspector any such telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owners shall have 30 days to bring such facility into compliance. In the event such telecommunications facility is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring the telecommunications facility to be removed. In the event such telecommunications facility is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the city may remove such facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  (Ord. of 4-19-2001) 
                  [Sec.] XII. - Abandoned towers. 
                  A.  Any telecommunications facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of it or any part of it. The owner of a telecommunications facility and the owner of the property where the facility is located shall be under a duty to remove the abandoned telecommunications facility. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  B.  If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this ordinance as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna. 
                  (Ord. of 4-19-2001) 
                  [Sec.] XIII. - Pre-existing towers/nonconforming uses. 
                  A.  All telecommunications facilities operative on April 19, 2001, the effective date of [this] ordinance, shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a nonconforming use and shall be treated as a nonconforming use. Routine maintenance, including replacement with a new tower or antenna of like construction and height, shall be permitted on such existing telecommunications facilities. New construction other than routine maintenance shall comply with the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  B.  A telecommunications facility that has received city approval as of the aforementioned effective date of this ordinance in the form of either a building permit or special use exception, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation shall be considered an existing telecommunications facility so long as such approval is current and not expired. 
                  C.  Placement of an antenna on a nonconforming structure shall not be considered an expansion of the nonconforming structure. 
                  (Ord. of 4-19-2001) 
                  [Sec.] XIV. - Penalty for violation of ordinance. 
                  A.  Any person who attempts to erect or erects a telecommunications facility covered by this ordinance without having first obtained the necessary building permit, special use permit or variance in the manner provided in this ordinance shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance. Any responsible party or other persons convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction of violating any provision of this ordinance shall be guilty of violating a duly adopted ordinance of the city and shall be punished either by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00, or by imprisonment not to exceed 12 months or both. The court shall have the power and authority to place any person guilty of violation of this ordinance on probation and to suspend or modify any fine or sentence. As a condition of such suspension, the court may require payment of restitution or impose other punishment allowed by law. 
                  B.  If any structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained in violation of this ordinance or without obtaining the required permits, or if any building, structure or land is used in violation of this article, the city attorney, in addition to any other remedies, may institute proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use or to correct or abate such violations. Each and every day such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use continues may be deemed a separate offense. 
                  (Ord. of 4-19-2001) 
                  Sec. XV. - Coordination with federal law. 
                  Whenever the governing authority finds that the application of this ordinance would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services or prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, a conditional use permit waiving any or all of the provisions of this ordinance may be granted.
