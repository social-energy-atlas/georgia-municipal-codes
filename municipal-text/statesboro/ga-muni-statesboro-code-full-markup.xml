PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Statesboro, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1987 Code, as supplemented through June 5, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1987 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. H. Carter Crawford, City Administrator, Mr. Gary L. Mikell, City Attorney, and Ms. Susan M. Mock, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

An Ordinance Adopting and Enacting a New Code for the City of Statesboro Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein; Providing a Penalty for the Violation Thereof; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; and Providing When Such Code and This Ordinance Shall Become Effective.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief, and revocation of licenses or permits. 
Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code, when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the city council to make the same a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omitted." 
In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Printed herein is the Charter for the City of Statesboro, Georgia, as set forth in 1987 Ga. Laws, page 4557. Amendments to the charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of capitalization, headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. Section number designations of the original act have been retained. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-32-1(a), the term "recorder's court" has been changed to "municipal court" and the term "recorder" has been changed to "municipal court judge" throughout the Charter and Code.

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  (b)  In addition to the penalties provided in subsection (a) of this section, any conditions caused or permitted to exist in violation of any provision of this Code or any ordinance shall be deemed a public nuisance, and may be abated by the city as provided by law, and each day that such conditions continue shall be regarded as new and separate offenses. 
                  (c)  The infliction of a penalty under the provisions of this section shall not prevent the revocation of any permit or license or the taking of other punitive or remedial action where called for or permitted under the provisions of the City's Charter or Code.

                  (b)  In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect an application for a new account, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft.

                  (1)  Request additional identifying information from the applicant; 
                  (2)  Deny the application for the new account;

                  Sec. 2-12. - Short title. 
                  This division shall be known as the "Open Records Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. No. 2012-05, § 1, 8-21-12) 
                  Sec. 2-12-1. - Open records officer. 
                  There is hereby created the office of open records officer. The city clerk is hereby designated as the city's open records officer; the open records officer may designate, in writing, assistant open records officer(s) as required to perform the duties of his or her office. Before undertaking the duties of the office, the open records officer and assistant open records officers shall take an oath, in writing, to diligently perform such duties. Compensation for the open records officer and his or her assistant open records officers shall be initially recommended by the city manager and approved by the city council and scheduled on the city's pay classification plan, as from time to time amended. The open records officer shall serve at the pleasure of the mayor and city council. 
                  (Ord. No. 2012-05, § 1, 8-21-12) 
                  Sec. 2-12-2. - Duties. 
                  It shall be the duty of the open records officer and his or her duly designated assistant open records officer(s) to accept written requests to inspect and copy public records, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq., and to produce to the requester all records responsive to a request within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed three business days of receipt of a request, unless the time for response is extended in accordance with law. No request shall be deemed filed until served upon the open records officer, either by hand delivery to the Officer at City Hall; 50 East Main Street, Statesboro, Georgia, 30458; by certified United States mail to Open Records Officer, P.O. Box 348, Statesboro, Georgia 30459, return receipt requested; by statutory overnight delivery to 50 East Main Street, Statesboro, Georgia, 30458; by email to openrecordsofficer@statesboroga.gov, or by facsimile transmission to 912-764-4691. Oral requests and requests, whether oral or in writing, served upon any other officer or employee of the city shall not be deemed filed, until the requester has filed his or her request, in writing, with the open records officer. In the absence or unavailability of the open records officer an assistant open records officer shall perform the duties of the open records officer. The absence or unavailability of a designated open records officer shall not delay the city's response to a properly served request. 
                  (Ord. No. 2012-05, § 1, 8-21-12) 
                  Sec. 2-12-3. - Request response. 
                  Upon receipt of a request it shall be the duty of the open records officer to promptly ascertain the availability of all public records responsive to the request and to produce to the requester those records that can be located and produced within a reasonable time, not to exceed three business days of receipt of a request. For purposes of computing the time within which a response must be made, the open records officer shall not count the business day on which a request is received, nor any intervening Saturday, Sunday, or designated holiday on which city offices are closed for general business. Upon intake of a request, the open records officer shall stamp the request with the date and time of receipt, and initial the request. In any instance where records are unavailable within three business days of the request, it shall be the duty of the open records officer to provide the requester with a written description of such records and a timeline for when the records will be available for inspection or copying and to provide the responsive records to the requester as soon thereafter as practicable. Such response shall also contain a good faith estimate of the cost to the requester for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production and copying of records. 
                  (1)  It is the intent that the open records officer be accessible within city hall during the normal hours of general operation of the city's administrative staff, i.e. 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, except on recognized holidays and those days when city hall is closed. The open records officer shall coordinate his or her work schedule with the assistant open records officers to assure coverage within city hall during normal hours at all times when the open records officer is scheduled to be absent or unavailable for extended periods of time. Backup procedures will be implemented by the city clerk to assure such coverage by assistant open records officers during the open records officer's unplanned absence or unavailability. 
                  (2)  Notice of the designation of open records officers shall be posted on the official bulletin board at city hall, in the legal organ of Bulloch County, and on the city's website. In addition, city officers, department managers, and administrative staff shall follow the direction of the open records officer on how to assist and direct persons desiring to request inspection and copying of public records. 
                  (3)  To further assist persons desiring to inspect records, a request form will be available at city hall and on the city's website. 
                  (4)  The open records officer shall confer with every officer or department manager of the city, as necessary, to ascertain the existence of public records responsive to a request (including electronically-stored information), and it shall be the duty of every city officer and department manager to confer with and provide records, or true and correct copies of the originals thereof, to the open records officer promptly, time being of the essence. Upon receipt of a public record responsive to a request, the open records officer shall determine, in consultation with the city attorney, if the record is exempt from disclosure by order of a court of this state or by law; if the record is exempt from disclosure, the written response by the open records officer shall set forth the specific legal authority under which withholding of inspection of the record is claimed. The open records officer shall maintain a log or other documentation of his or her due diligence to comply with a proper request

                  Sec. 2-12-4. - Fees. 
                  The open records officer shall further have the duty to collect from a requester a reasonable charge for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of records, utilizing the most economical means available to identify and produce non-excluded records. The charge for the search, retrieval, or redaction of records shall not exceed the prorated hourly salary of the lowest paid full-time employee who, in the reasonable discretion of the open records officer, has the necessary skill and training to perform the request; provided, however, no charge shall be made for the first quarter hour. In addition thereto, where certified copies of specific records are sought, the fees for certified copies prescribed by law shall apply; otherwise, a fee for the copying of records shall not exceed $0.10 per page for letter or legal size documents or, in the case of other documents and electronic records, the actual cost of reproducing the document or media on which the records or media are produced. It shall be the right of the requester, at the time of inspection, to make photographic copies or other electronic reproductions of records, at his or her own expense, using suitable portable devices brought to the place of inspection. Whenever any person has requested to inspect and copy public records and received a written response estimating the cost of the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of the records responsive to the request, and the city has actually incurred such costs but the requester fails to inspect or accept copies of the records, the open records officer shall be authorized to collect such charges in any manner authorized by law. 
                  In any instance in which the open records officer has estimated costs in excess of $25.00 for responding to a request, the open records officer may defer the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of the records until the requester has stated, in writing, his or her willingness to pay an amount equal to the estimate of costs. In any instance in which the estimated costs exceed $500.00, the open records officer shall insist, in writing, upon prepayment of the estimated costs prior to beginning search, retrieval, redaction, production or copying of the records. In any instance in which a requester has outstanding costs owing to the city for a previous records request, the open records officer shall insist upon prepayment of the outstanding costs and estimated costs prior to beginning search and retrieval.

                  Sec. 2-12-5. - Litigation. 
                  Requests by civil litigants, or their counsel of record, in any ongoing civil action or administrative proceeding shall be made in writing and shall include the style of the action or proceeding, the names and addresses of all parties and, if a party is represented by counsel, the name, address, and telephone number of the party's attorney; a copy of the request shall be served by the requester upon all parties or their counsel of record in the action or proceeding contemporaneous to filing the written request with the open records officer. The open records officer shall make duplicate set(s) of records provided in response to the request available to all parties or their counsel for the cost of copies only, unless a party or its counsel elects not to receive the records and pay the copying charge. If the city is a party to the action or proceeding, a set of responses shall be provided to counsel for the city at no charge.

                  The open records officer and assistant open records officer(s) shall, prior to assuming the duties of their office, undergo a course of training in public records management and specifically compliance with the Georgia Open Records Law, O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq., as approved by the city attorney. It shall be the responsibility of the city clerk, at least annually, to conduct a workshop for city officers and department managers on the minimum requirements and procedures for public records management and open records disclosure, including the penalties or civil fines that may be imposed for violating Georgia's public records laws.

                  Except as otherwise provided for in emergencies, no purchase order shall be issued unless there is a sufficient unencumbered appropriation, in excess of all unpaid obligations of the using agency to cover the amount of such purchase.

                  All purchases for the city shall fall into two distinct categories, with each category containing several possible methods. The using agency should review these methods and determine which is the appropriate method for the contemplated purchase.

Details on the procedures to follow for each purchase method shall be contained in the Uniform Purchasing Manual, which after approval by the mayor and city council shall be furnished by the city manager to all department and division heads of the city.

                  Sec. 5-314. - Procurement card process. 
                  The city manager is hereby authorized to implement a procurement card system for use by the various departments of the city. The use of such cards shall be governed by a written policy developed and approved by the mayor and city council to limit the amount per transaction, and assure the ability to audit each purchase by each individual user assigned a card. Department heads shall recommend to the city manager the specific employees that they wish to issue such a card, with the specified dollar limit per transaction, which shall not exceed $5,000.00. The city manager is authorized to allow higher limits for the fleet management personnel given the high cost of some replacement parts, provided that those increased limits are approved by the mayor and city council.

                  Sec. 5-315. - Telephone quote process. 
                  Any purchase which is between $1,000.01 and $5,000.00 must use a purchase order, after having obtained at least three telephone quotes for the specific product, contract or service. Each vendor must be given sufficient information to assure that the quotes are for the same product, or a similar product made by another company. The telephone quotes must be recorded by the department, with the date and the signature of the employee who made the calls. This information must be attached to the purchase order as a record of the calls and kept by the finance department. If using a procurement card, required quote records shall be kept if the purchase is above the $1,000.00 limit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-09, 11-1-11) 
                  Sec. 5-316. - Written quote process. 
                  Any purchase which is between $5,000.01 and $19,999.99 must use a purchase order, after having obtained written quotes for the specific product, contract or service. Since this method does not require sealed bids, the city will allow either mailed, faxed, or emailed quotes, as long as they contain the date, a clear description of the product offered, its price, and any delivery terms, and the name and position of the company representative who has prepared the quote. 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-09, 11-1-11) 
                  Sec. 5-317. - Sealed bid process. 
                  (a)  This process must be used for any purchase that is for $20,000.00 or more, unless one of the special procurement methods applies. This process requires the advertisement twice in the local newspaper in which sheriff's sales are advertised, spaced seven days apart, with the first advertisement printed at least 14 days before the date of the bid opening. The bid must contain the desired quantity and a description of the product or service desired; how to obtain detailed specifications and get answers about them; where and when to submit the bids; how to address the envelope; the time and place where the bids shall be opened, read aloud, and recorded; and any special instructions or conditions, such as attendance at a mandatory or voluntary pre-bid conference. 
                  (b)  All sealed bid process purchases must be pre-approved by the city manager or his designee before advertisement begins. All sealed bid purchases shall be awarded by the mayor and city council. No contract concerning a sealed bid shall be signed by a city designee prior to being approved by the mayor and city council. 
                  (c)  In lieu of the sealed bid process the city manager may authorize the use of the reverse auction process provided by the Georgia Municipal Association through a contracted service provider.

                  Sec. 5-318. - Fixed price agreements process. 
                  Goods or services used by one or more using agencies on a regular and continuing basis may be purchased under a contract covering a specified extended period of time, at an established price for such goods or services which shall be valid for the duration of the contract period. Purchase agreements under this provision shall be subject to the sealed bid process in section 5-317 above. The departments of the city could then purchase these goods or services on an as-needed basis throughout the agreed time period at the accepted bid price with a valid purchase order, or using the procurement card if the cost is below the assigned card's transaction limit.

                  Sec. 5-319. - Open purchase order process. 
                  Department heads may request that the city manager authorize the issuance of an open purchase order for a specified vendor, for a specified period not to exceed a month, with a maximum dollar figure attached. Such purchase orders can only be used by specified employees of that department, with vendors that the city does business with on a regularly recurring basis. This process should be used only when in the city manager's judgment one of the other general procurement methods above will not afford the timely acquisition of needed supplies, materials, or services. 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-09, 11-1-11) 
                  Sec. 5-320. - Georgia local government public works construction law projects. 
                  (a)  This process shall be used by the city in order to comply with state law. The O.C.G.A. §§ 36-91-1 through 36-91-95, or as subsequently amended, requires cities that engage in the building, altering, repairing, improving, or demolishing of any public structure or building or other public improvements of any kind to any public real property other than those projects covered by O.C.G.A. Chapter 4 of Title 32 (see section 5-321 below) in which the value of said work is $100,000.00 or more, to use the competitive bid or proposal processes set out in these statutory provisions, unless the proposed work qualifies for one of the limited exceptions. This statute does not apply to the routine operation, repair, or maintenance of existing structures, buildings, or real property. 
                  For public works projects under $20,000.00, competitive written quotes and proposals, per city policy, shall be obtained and presented to the city manager for approval. For projects costing $20,000.00 to $100,000.00 competitive written quotes shall be obtained and submitted to council for approval. Although there is no required sealed bid/proposal process per House Bill 1079 for projects with a cost of $100,000.00 or less, complete and detailed documentation of obtained written quotes shall be provided and kept in the central services division. The central services division shall be involved in every stage of the process in obtaining competitive written quotes. Vendors shall submit written quotes to the central services division by the determined due date and time. Although many formalities are not required for projects with a cost of $100,000.00 or less, vendors will be given a due date and time for written quotes and the quotes shall be in a sealed envelope at the time of submittal to the central services division. 
                  (b)  The preferred construction delivery method for these projects is the "design, bid, build" method. No other method allowed by state law shall be used unless expressly approved by the mayor and city council. No project requiring a contract under this method shall begin the design phase without the express approval of the city manager, even if it has been included in the annual capital budget, so that its methods of financing, design, advertisement, and award have been thoroughly reviewed.

                  Sec. 5-321. - Georgia municipal street projects. 
                  (a)  This process shall be used by the city in order to comply with state law. The O.C.G.A. §§ 32-4-90 through 32-4-123, or as subsequently amended, requires cities that engage in a contract valued at $20,000.00 or more for the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of all or part of a public road in said municipality, including but not limited to a contract or subcontract for the purchase of materials, for the hiring of labor, for professional services, or for other things or services incident to such work, to use the competitive bid process set out in these statutory provisions, unless the proposed work qualifies for one of the limited exceptions. If the professional service design phase stands alone and is not part of a complete project package that contains a construction and management element, the requirements for obtaining professional services for street projects shall fall under the general provisions of the professional service guidelines contained in House Bill 1079. 
                  (b)  No project requiring a contract under this method shall begin the design phase without the express approval of the city manager, even if it has been included in the annual capital budget, so that its methods of financing, design, advertisement, and award have been thoroughly reviewed.

                  Sec. 5-322. - Sole source purchases. 
                  The city manager shall be authorized to designate a sole source for any item or service under $20,000.00 in value, the purchase of which, due to special scientific, technological, or extraordinary specifications and circumstances such as but not limited to standardization, is available from only one vendor. Any such purchase shall be documented as to the reasons for the sole source and shall be maintained in the office of the central services division. Any proposed sole source purchase that is $20,000.00 or more in value must be approved by the mayor and city council.

                  Editor's note— Section 1 of an Ordinance adopted March 5, 2002, set out provisions intended for use as Ch. 91. For purposes of classification and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included herein as Art. VII, §§ 18-171—18-206. 

                  Sec. 18-171. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult entertainment establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
                  (b)  Findings. Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana; Athens-Clarke County, Georgia; Marietta, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; Warner Robins, Georgia; Rome, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; and Smyrna, Georgia; which experiences, we believe are relevant to the issues faced by the City of Statesboro, Georgia, the mayor and city council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the mayor and city council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood; increased expenditures for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order; increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described; and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or partially nude conduct in establishments affects the public welfare; and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that allow and/or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, this article is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted.

                  (a)  The city may suspend or revoke the city issued license of any location owner or location operator to manufacture, distribute, or sell alcoholic beverages as a penalty for the conviction of the business owner or business operator of a violation of the Official Code of Georgia, Section 16-12-35, subsection (e), (f), or (g).

                  (c)  The suspension or revocation of licenses under this Code section shall be in accordance with the following guidelines of due process: 
                  (1)  No license which has been issued or which may be issued pursuant to this article shall be suspended or revoked except for due cause and after hearing and upon prior three-day written notice to the holder of the license of the time, place and purpose of the hearing and a statement of the charges upon which the hearing shall be held. 
                  (2)  The term "due cause" for the purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to: 
                  a.  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, misdemeanor, or any law, administrative regulation or local ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics, tax laws, or the operation of an amusement game room. 
                  b.  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any sex offense when the licensed business is for on-premises consumption. 
                  c.  Suspension or revocation of any state license required as a condition for the possession, sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages. 
                  d.  Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor. Any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented. 
                  e.  Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this article as a condition or qualification for holding a license. 
                  f.  Any other factor known to or discovered by the city whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any of the licensee's employees or any person holding an interest in a license, has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, local ordinance or administrative regulations involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics for all alcohol licensed businesses and including any sex offense under state law or local ordinances with respect to businesses licensed for on-premises consumption. With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity. 
                  (3)  Notice of suspension or revocation proceedings shall be served on the person named as licensee in the application. Notice shall be in writing. The notice may be served personally or by first class mail. If by mail, the notice shall be addressed to the licensee at its address as provided by the licensee to the municipality.

                  (5)  Hearings shall be only as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice. The city attorney shall present the city's case and bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that due cause exists to suspend or revoke the license. At the hearing the licensee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross examine all witnesses offered by the city, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the hearing officer shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation. 
                  (6)  The hearing officer shall make his final determination within ten business days of the completion of the hearing.

Such sanction may include one or more of the following: revocation of the license, suspension of the license for no more than 12 months, imposition of a probationary period not to exceed 12 months, and/or a civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount allowed under the city charter. Progressive sanctions, depending on the severity of the violation, are encouraged but not required. Where the remaining term of the license is less than 12 months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three separate and unrelated violations within 24 months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
                  (7)  The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the city, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court. 
                  (8)  Upon receipt of notice of adverse action against the licensee under this section, the licensee may waive its right to a hearing and stipulate to a sanction, as recommended by the city manager, in consultation with the director of public safety or his designee. Any stipulation entered under this subsection shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and non-appealable.

                  Sec. 38-30. - Procedure for hearings; findings by court; abatement. 
                  (a)  Whenever a public officer finds conditions within the geographical limits of the city that the public officer believes constitute a public nuisance as provided in this chapter, the public officer shall notify the city manager, or his or her designee, who may forthwith cause to be filed a complaint in the name of the city seeking to abate the conditions on grounds it constitutes a public nuisance. 
                  (b)  At the hearing, the burden shall be upon the city to prove its complaint by competent evidence. The responding party(s) shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by counsel, to present evidence and to cross-examine the city's witnesses. 
                  (c)  If, after hearing, the court determines that dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the judge shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling, building or structure can be made at reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling, building or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  (d)  For the purposes of this subsection, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. tit. 43, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented.

Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 calendar days in which such abatement action must commence. The Public Officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupancy of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (f)  If the city manager or his or her designee has the structure demolished, then reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any monies received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The city manager or his or her designee and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (g)  The cost of bringing a complaint pursuant to this chapter, together with any costs reasonably incurred by the city in abatement of a public nuisance after determination thereof by a court of competent jurisdiction, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be in a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the Bulloch County Superior Court Clerk and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice. The Bulloch County Superior Court Clerk shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the Bulloch County deed records and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  (h)  The city may enforce its lien in the following manner: 
                  (1)  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this chapter, the city manager or his or her designee shall transmit to the city clerk a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notice of lis pendens provided to interested parties. The statement of the city manager or his or her designee shall be transmitted within 90 calendar days of completion of the abatement, repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the city revenue officer who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. 
                  (2)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this chapter may be initiated at any time following receipt by the city clerk of the final determination of costs in accordance with this chapter. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
                  (3)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this chapter shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this chapter together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority, county tax commissioner, or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (i)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (j)  Nothing contained herein shall prevent or prohibit the court from punishing by its contempt powers any owner or parties in interest that willfully fail or refuse to comply with an order entered in accordance with this chapter.

                  DIVISION 2. - DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS 

                  Sec. 38-91. - Applicability. 
                  The policies, design principles and standards set out in this division in regard to grading, soil erosion and sedimentation control and drainage shall be incorporated in the plans and conduct of any development, excavation, construction or land-disturbing activity within the city, and incorporated into site plans submitted to the city engineer in applying for a permit under this article. 
                  (Ord. of 6-18-96(1)) 
                  Sec. 38-92. - Grading. 
                  Grading of development, construction or land-disturbing activity shall be conducted in a manner that: 
                  (1)  Encourages the design of grading plans to provide natural appearance of land contours and to provide ease of use in public areas. 
                  (2)  Minimizes the adverse effect of land clearance and grading upon existing vegetation. 
                  (3)  Minimizes the adverse effects of land clearance and grading upon the drainage system by strict erosion control and sedimentation and control devices and alteration of natural or established drainage patterns. 
                  (Ord. of 6-18-96(1)) 
                  Sec. 38-93. - Drainage. 
                  (a)  Design principles. Development, excavation, construction or land-disturbing activity shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the following principles: 
                  (1)  Maintaining, where feasible, the natural environment of city streams or drainageways through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development and, where feasible, restoring the floodplain to its natural functional purpose to resolve existing flooding problems, but recognizing the necessity of using urban streams for stormwater runoff in those situations where maintenance of the natural stream environment would result in continuation or worsening of flooding conditions. 
                  (2)  Encouraging innovative design solutions to the effective detention/retention and reduction of runoff. Drainage control measures to retain, reduce and regulate the rate of stormwater discharge shall include but need not be limited to retention or detention ponds, percolation facilities, parking lots, open space areas, and oversized storm drains with restricted outlets. In addition, the city encourages the development of retention facilities in such a manner that they will become aesthetically and recreationally beneficial to the community in which they are located. 
                  (b)  Design and maintenance standards. All development, construction and land-disturbing activities shall be conducted in compliance with the following standards: 
                  (1)  All engineering design items for storm drainage and delineation of the 100-year floodplain shall meet the applicable minimum requirements available from the city engineer. Rainfall intensities used in hydrologic computations shall not be less than shown by applicable rainfall curves published by the National Weather Service for the affected area. 
                  (2)  A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all developments and construction which will increase the peak rate of runoff from the site by more than one cubic foot per second (cfs) for a 10-year frequency storm of 24-hour duration; however, this shall not apply to those activities specifically exempted in section 38-70. 
                  (3)  The release rate of stormwater from all developments where retention or detention is required shall not exceed the peak stormwater runoff rate from the area in its existing state from all intensities up to and including the 25-year frequency for a 24-hour storm. 
                  (4)  The drainage system being developed shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of 25-year design frequency, except for areas considered to be major drainage canals. The major drainage canals shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of 100-year frequency. 
                  (5)  Land uses within the 100-year floodplain shall not diminish or restrict the capacity of the channels or floodplains of the stream or its tributaries, drainage ditches or any other drainage facilities or systems, and shall not increase the 100-year elevation or velocity or concentration of flow in downstream areas. If the required hydrologic studies reveal that a request for filling or grading within the 100-year floodplain would overload the capacity of the channel downstream or increase flood stages upstream, the development permit shall be denied unless equivalent flow and storage capacity is replaced and maintained by the owner within the 100-year floodplain. Altered sections of the 100-year floodplain shall have a positive slope so as to provide positive drainage back to the stream flow line, and these sections must be maintained by the owners in perpetuity so as to prevent or remove silt buildup. 
                  (6)  The live detention/retention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of the 25-year frequency rainfall as published by the National Weather Service for the affected areas. The detention/retention system required shall be that necessary to handle the runoff for all storm frequencies up to and including 25-year, 24-hour storm. Detention/retention control structures and other drainage improvements shall be located and designed to prevent erosion damage to adjacent property owners. Retention or detention control structures shall be sized for the release rate as presented in this section, and will have provisions for overflow of the 50-year and 100-year storms without damage to the structure. 
                  (7)  When the developer requests and the city engineer determines that development and construction projects are too small, or that engineering and economic factors make combined detention/retention or other drainage facilities more practical, the city may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two or more properties by two or more developers. This authorization shall be granted by the city engineer. Where joint detention/retention facilities serving two or more properties are approved for construction, no use of land or occupancy of buildings within the properties served by these facilities shall be permitted until completion of the detention/retention facility, except upon approval of the city administrator. 
                  (8)  When adequacy of existing drainage structures is being considered in association with proposed development, the overall capacity of the structure will be evaluated and divided among upstream properties. The available capacity will be divided among property owners based on acreage in the basin. Under no condition will the available capacity of the structure be exceeded. Should the developer desire to replace the structure in lieu of retention or detention, all downstream structures should be evaluated and deemed adequate. 
                  (9)  The following requirements shall apply to the installation, development and maintenance of all retention, detention and sedimentation control facilities designed for storage of stormwater runoff: 
                  a.  These facilities shall be located on tracts of land designated for this use on the recorded plat, with sufficient area around the perimeter to provide access for maintenance purposes. The access easement shall provide at least 20 feet of width outside of aboveground obstructions, including trees, headwalls, wires and settling basins or other drainage structures. 
                  b.  Perforated standpipes or a french drain, as approved by the city engineer, or other methods which will achieve equal performance to prevent standing of water and inadequate drainage, shall be installed within all these facilities. 
                  c.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, the property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of these detention/retention facilities during grading and construction and following final approval of the completed project. This maintenance obligation shall be binding on future owners, successors and assigns of the property. 
                  d.  In the case of single-family residential subdivisions approved after the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives, the city shall assume maintenance responsibility two years after the release of subdivision streets. A special drainage district as authorized by 1972 Ga. Laws, page 1552, is established for property in a single-family residential subdivision at the time the plat is finally recorded, and will be so noted on the plat. Upon completion of developer maintenance, all detention ponds shall have a positive slope to the outlet in order to facilitate complete drainage. Detention/retention facilities shall be designed so that they are safe and where possible restrict access to the public. 
                  e.  Those facilities in single-family residential subdivisions constructed under permits issued prior to the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives will not be accepted for city maintenance unless such facilities are individually approved by and at the discretion of the city council and suitable access easements are provided. At the time the city council accepts a detention/retention facility for city maintenance, a special drainage district may be established that includes all properties for which the detention/retention facility is designed to compensate for increased peak runoff rates due to development. 
                  f.  Pursuant to the creation of special drainage districts by the city as authorized by 1972 Ga. Laws, page 1552, revenues to fund city detention/retention facilities maintenance may be obtained by an ad valorem tax on all properties for which the retention facilities are designed to compensate for increased peak runoff rates due to development. Such ad valorem millage rates may be set annually by the city council when other ad valorem millage rates are set. No assessment will be made in a special drainage district in the calendar year in which it is established. 
                  (10)  All buildings located adjacent to or in the 100-year floodplain shall be constructed in accordance with chapter 46, pertaining to flood damage prevention. 
                  (11)  Special drainage system maintenance requirements are as follows: 
                  a.  No impoundment of water which retains in excess of 0.5 acre-feet of runoff shall be removed without first obtaining a development permit, which shall only be issued after competent engineering studies provided by the developer show that this removal will not adversely affect downstream properties. 
                  b.  Trash, garbage, construction materials, construction byproducts or other debris shall not be deposited in any part of the drainage system. 
                  c.  No restrictions or barriers, including fences, may be placed in the drainage system without first obtaining a development permit. When onsite or offsite debris has accumulated within a floodplain in such a manner as to interfere with the free flow of water so as to increase the risk of hazardous inundation of upstream properties adjacent to the floodplain, the public works director shall require the owner of the property where this debris was generated, if its source can be identified, to clear and remove the debris so as to permit the free flow of water. 
                  (12)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
                  (13)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharges from the systems into drainageways. 
                  (14)  Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
                  (15)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

                  Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control measures means measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with: 
                  (1)  Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover; or 
                  (2)  Temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or 
                  (3)  Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass. 
                  Such measures can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
                  Watercourse means any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

                  Sec. 38-123. - Exemptions. 
                  This article shall apply to any land-disturbing activity undertaken by any person on any land except for the following: 
                  (1)  Surface mining, as the same is defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-4-72, "The Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968". 
                  (2)  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying; 
                  (3)  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
                  (4)  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority; 
                  (5)  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3, "definitions", to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds; 
                  (6)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in paragraphs (15) and (16) of subsection 38-124(c). of this ordinance, no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  (7)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  (8)  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this paragraph, "state waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Local Issuing Authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) or (10) of this section; 
                  (9)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road and tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7.1; except where the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  (10)  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and 
                  (11)  Any public water system reservoir.

                  Sec. 38-124. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 38-124(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 38-124(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 38-124(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any pehemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an pehemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 38-124(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-15, 7-7-10) 
                  Sec. 38-125. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Statesboro without first obtaining a permit from the City of Statesboro Engineering Department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Statesboro Engineering Department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 38-125(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 38-124(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 38-124(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 38-125(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has an existing uncorrected violation(s), or has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 38-124(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 38-124(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 38-125(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has an existing uncorrected violation(s), or has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, or in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-15, 7-7-10) 
                  Sec. 38-126. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The City of Statesboro Engineering Department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person.

                  Sec. 46-1. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Statesboro, Georgia, does ordain as follows. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-14, 7-7-10) 
                  Sec. 46-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Statesboro, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-14, 7-7-10) 
                  Sec. 46-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-14, 7-7-10) 
                  Sec. 46-4. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and, 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  ARTICLE IV. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 46-101. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  No development shall be allowed within the floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
                  a.  Reducing the base flood storage capacity; 
                  b.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood as they pass both the upstream and downstream boundaries of the development area; or, 
                  c.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
                  (2)  Compensatory storage. Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and lie within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided by excavating below the elevation of the stream channel. Compensatory grading plan shall be submitted to city engineer for review. 
                  (3)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (4)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (5)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (6)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and, 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (7)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (8)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (9)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (10)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (11)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
                  (12)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 46-102. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of article IV, subsection 46-101(6), "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in article III, subsection 46-78(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (i) individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Reference article IV subsection 46-101(8) above.) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of article IV, subsections 46-102(3)a. and c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in article II, section 46-42, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if article IV, subsection 46-102(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV.

                  Sec. 46-103. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-Zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in article II, section 46-42, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with article II, section 46-42, then the city engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of article IV. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of article IV, subsection 46-101(6) "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  [Sec. 46-121. - Variance procedures.] 
                  (a)  The mayor and city council (appeals board) shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The appeals board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city engineer in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeals board may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Bulloch County as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the appeals board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The city engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the appeals board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after May 15, 1980 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after May 15, 1980 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after May 15, 1980. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: Accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the cast of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with this procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

                  (1)  Licensing. All alarm companies operating within the city must be licensed and registered with the city clerk. 
                  (2)  Administrative notification lists. Each alarm company operating in the city must be licensed and registered with the city clerk. 
                  (3)  Automatic dialers. It shall be unlawful to key automatic dialer burglar alarms or robbery alarms to the city police department, 911 or to the city switchboard. These types of alarms shall be keyed to a private service that can notify the police department. Automatic dialers for fire alarms are permissible. 
                  (4)  Automatic response alarms. 
                  a.  It shall be unlawful to key automatic response (burglary or robbery) alarms to the city alarm board, except that it shall be lawful to key automatic response alarms of Federal Bureau of Investigation-monitored financial institutions, i.e. banks, savings and loan associations and all city installations, to the city alarm board, provided that those financial institutions keyed to the alarm board shall have state-of-the art systems installed and available to the city. Approval of the city's public safety council shall be obtained prior to the installation. 
                  b.  Further, provided that each financial institution keyed to the automatic response system shall be assessed a monitoring fee of $100.00 per year per branch to key to the city alarm board. All maintenance costs for the upkeep of such systems shall be borne by the financial institutions. This fee is in addition to the original licensing fee (see subsection (c)(3)). All other alarms, other than financial institutions presently keyed to the city alarm board, are hereby grandfathered and will be allowed to remain keyed to the city alarm board. The monitoring fee of $100.00 per year per location applies to these alarms. No other alarms, other than financial institutions, will be allowed to key to the city alarm board. 
                  (5)  Underwriters' Laboratories (UL) approved equipment. All alarms shall be on Underwriter's Laboratories (UL) approved equipment and shall have complete electrical standby capacity. 
                  (6)  False alarms. 
                  a.  Response fees. 
                  1.  For a police or fire response to any false alarm of an automatic response or independent alarm system, the city shall charge and collect from the person, business or legal entity having or maintaining the automatic response alarm system on the premises owned or leased by these, fees as follows: 

                   
                  2.  Any business, government entity, school, board of education or Georgia Southern University which has multiple alarms at different locations shall be assessed an alarm fee for each false alarm received from each individual location based on the above schedule of fees. 
                  3.  Notice of fines shall be given to the person or business having or maintaining the alarm system of the conditions and requirements of this section, including the fee requirements for four or more false alarm responses by the police or fire department within the fiscal year. False alarm service fees assessed will be due and payable within 30 days following notice thereof, and treated as any other municipal liability, such as taxes, and issued a fi.fa. and an execution. 
                  4.  If such false alarms are as a result of failure to take necessary corrective action, the police chief and fire chief may use their discretion to revoke the alarm permit for the premises and order the disconnection of the alarm system until such corrective action has been taken and a new permit is issued by the city provided that no disconnection shall be ordered as to any premises required by law to have an alarm system in operation. False alarms that are a result of an act of nature (power outage, lightning storm, etc) will not count against the business as a false alarm. 
                  b.  Appeals. In the event that a location is assessed a false alarm fee, and the owner, business or legal entity does not agree that the alarm activation should be classified as a false alarm, the owner, business or legal entity is entitled to appeal the ruling through the proper process as follows: 
                  1.  The proper representative of the owner, business, or legal entity, having or maintaining the alarm system may contact the chief of the agency that responded to the alarm (fire or police) and appeal the ruling. 
                  2.  In the event that the owner, business or legal entity (proper representative) and the police or fire chief are not able to resolve and agree on the alarm classification, the proper representative may request a meeting with the public safety committee to appeal the ruling. 
                  3.  The ruling of the public safety committee will be final. 
                  (7)  Automatic cut-off system. All audible alarms, sirens, bells or horns shall have an automatic cut-off system so that such alarm shall not operate for more than 30 continuous minutes. In the event that an audible alarm should be activated for more than 30 minutes, the permit holder will be liable for a noise ordinance citation (see sections 38-101 through 38-106 of this Code). This section does not apply for fire alarms. 
                  (c)  Permit. 
                  (1)  Prior to doing business within the city, any person who installs or maintains alarm devices shall obtain a permit from the public safety council as follows: (NOTE: The penalty for providing false information in order to receive a permit is $100.00.) 
                  a.  All persons desiring to obtain a permit shall make written application to the city upon forms to be prepared and approved by the clerk and this application shall be sworn to by the applicant or the applicant's agent. 
                  b.  All applications shall contain the full name and address of the applicant, a telephone number at which the police department or fire department can notify the applicant or his or her personnel of a need for assistance at any time, the state law voltage license number under which the installer(s) will be working, and all other data, information and records requested of them by the chief of police or fire chief; and failure to furnish this data, information and records within 30 days from the date of this request shall automatically serve to dismiss, with prejudice, the application. Applicant shall reapply no sooner than six months from the date of dismissal. 
                  c.  Each alarm system business shall notify the police department and fire department, in writing, of any change in the telephone number by which personnel can be reached within 72 hours of such change. 
                  d.  Each alarm system business, monitoring station, or other entity who receives alarm activations for the purpose of calling for police and fire response shall be responsible for providing accurate information, such as address and emergency telephone numbers, for clients that they are serving. Each alarm system business, monitoring station or other entity who receives alarm actions for the purpose of calling for police or fire response shall be required to maintain an up-to-date list of all customers that they are serving. This list shall contain the proper address, home telephone number, work telephone number or any other telephone number where clients can be reached in case of alarm activation. Each alarm system business, monitoring station, or other entity who receives alarm actions for the purpose of calling for police or fire response shall be responsible for contacting their clients to grant access to the premises where an alarm has been activated when requested to do so by a member of the police department or fire department. 
                  e.  No alarm system business, monitoring station, or other entity shall operate or cause to be operated, or install any device or combination of devices that will, upon action, either mechanically, electronically or by any other automatic means, initiate a call and deliver a recorded message to any telephone number or numbers assigned to the city by a public telephone company, with the exception of fire alarms. 
                  f.  If an alarm system is actively being serviced where false activations are possible, the technician shall notify the appropriate department (whether police or fire) so that no response will be made until servicing is complete. Failure to do this will be considered a false alarm. 
                  (2)  It shall be unlawful for any person to install, operate, cause to be operated, authorize or allow the operation of an alarm system unless a current permit has been issued by the public safety council for such system. Provided, however, this section shall not be applicable to an alarm system business which monitors, services, or monitors and serves an alarm system installed and designed to protect property under the control of a person other than the alarm system business. For the purpose of this section, person in control of the property shall mean a person having ownership or a leasehold interest in the property on which an alarm system is to be installed and operated. The application shall be made in writing to the city clerk on a form designated by the public safety council for that purpose. On such application, the applicant shall set forth: 
                  a.  The name, address, and telephone number of each person in control of the property; 
                  b.  The street address of the property on which the alarm system is to be installed and operated; 
                  c.  Any business name used for the premises on which the alarm system is to be installed and operated; 
                  d.  The name of the person or alarm system business who will install the alarm system; 
                  e.  Automatic response alarm users shall furnish the name and telephone numbers of the alarm system business which can contact the alarm user through emergency telephone numbers provided them by the alarm user; 
                  f.  Independent alarm users shall furnish home, work, or any other telephone number where they may be contacted in case of alarm activation. These telephone numbers shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where an independent alarm system is located. 
                  (3)  The application shall be signed by the person making the application for the permit. The city clerk shall issue a permit to the individual, corporation, partnership, or other legal entity having an ownership or leasehold interest in the property upon submission of an application in accordance with this section, and payment of a permit fee. The fee for residential permits as well as commercial permits shall be $5.00 per year. In the case of multiple alarms, a permit shall be required for each alarm system. If it is found that any statement made on the application is false, then a permit shall not be issued. Before a commercial permit shall be issued, the owner/agent must provide proof of a current city business license. Each permit issued in accordance with this section shall be valid until such time as the control of the property is transferred from the permit holder. Upon such transfer of the property, a new permit shall be obtained. 
                  (4)  Any person who has an alarm system which was installed on his or her property prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived is required to obtain a permit for the alarm system within 30 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. During the 30-day grace period, the alarm system can continue to operate. To obtain such a permit, the person in control of the property shall file an application thereof pursuant to this section and pay the permit fee. After the expiration of the 30-day grace period, the person in control of the property which the alarm system is designed to protect shall be subject to prosecution if he or she permits the operation of the alarm without a valid permit. 
                  (5)  The permit holder for an alarm system shall keep the permit at the alarm site and shall produce the permit for inspection upon the request of any member of the police department or fire department. 
                  (6)  The person in control of the property on which an alarm system is installed shall train all persons who may activate the alarm system in the proper operation of the alarm system. Upon initial installation, there will be a ten-day grace period for user adjustment and employee training. 
                  (7)  The person in control of the property shall ensure that the alarm system is repaired within 72 hours of the time that notification of the system is malfunctioning is given in writing on a form designated by either the fire chief or police chief to the owner/lessee or to a company employee or agent by a member of the police department or fire department designated to give such notices. The person in control of the property may cause the system to be disarmed rather than having it repaired. If the system is disarmed rather than repaired, it shall not be rearmed until it has been repaired. Any system that is required by federal, state, or local code may not be disarmed. 
                  (8)  Those persons who install their own audible alarm or who are not using an alarm company or monitoring station, if they want to receive service, shall be required to furnish all the emergency telephone numbers at which they can be reached in case of an alarm activation. These numbers shall also be posted in a conspicuous location on the premises where an independent alarm system is located.

                  Editor's note— An Ordinance adopted Dec. 4, 2001, set out provisions intended for use as Ch. 87. For purposes of alphabetization or to preserve the style of this Code, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included herein as Ch. 62, §§ 62-1, 62-2. 
                  Cross reference— Planning commission, § 2-66 et seq.; cable communications, ch. 22; environment, ch. 38; floods, ch. 46; streets, sidewalks and other places, ch. 70; utilities, ch. 82; vegetation, ch. 86; zoning, app. A; subdivision regulations, app. B. 

                  Sec. 62-1. - Criteria to qualify for incentives. 
                  In order to encourage the development of single-family residential subdivisions inside the corporate limits, the city may provide incentives to developers for property meeting the following criteria, subject to the availability of funding: 
                  (1)  The property must either be within the city limits, or pre- annexed into the city prior to any sketch plan or preliminary platting so that the property is developed totally under the city's subdivision ordinance, zoning ordinance, and other land use regulatory ordinances. Property outside the city must meet the requirements for annexation under Georgia statutes, so that the property is clearly within the city limits before any incentives can be contracted for or received. 
                  (2)  The property must be zoned either R-15 or R-20 by the city. The city may consider extending these incentives to property zoned PUD, that is used exclusively for single-family residential developments at a density per acre not exceeding the R-15 designation. The intent of this provision is to allow developers flexibility in developing cluster housing on smaller lots, with a corresponding increase in open space in common ownership maintained by a homeowners' association or similar entity. This allows for savings on utility and street systems, and the preservation of open space and unique physical features, while allowing no more population density per acre than a standard R-15 subdivision would allow. If the density per acre is equal to or less than that allowed in the R-20 zone, the R-20 incentives shall apply. If the density per acre is equal to or less than that allowed in the R-15 zone but greater than that allowed in the R-20 zone, the R-15 incentives shall apply. 
                  (3)  The property must be reasonably close to existing water and sewer lines such that the city can economically extend the main lines to the subdivision. Such determination shall be made at the discretion of the City of Statesboro. 
                  (4)  The subdivider must enter into a written agreement with the city, in a form acceptable to the city attorney, delineating the subdivider's and city's respective responsibilities for the various components of development. 
                  (5)  The subdivider must develop the subdivision using underground electric, telephone, and CATV lines, curb and gutter, sidewalk on at least one side of each street, decorative street lights and poles, and covenants and restrictions requiring brick veneer or comparable construction and a minimum of a two-car enclosed garage. The intent is to develop subdivisions with high-end amenities compared to the existing market in the county. 
                  (6)  The subdivision must be developed in reasonably-sized phases so as not to place a financial strain on either the developer or the city. 
                  (7)  The city will evaluate which, if any subdivisions, to incentivize based upon the following criteria: 
                  a.  The city's relative cost per lot to fund the incentive program, including the cost to get the major water and sewer lines to the property, minus any capital cost recovery fees or similar reimbursement programs designed to offset some of these costs to the city. 
                  b.  The relative desirability of the proposed locations, considering surrounding developments and zoning of undeveloped property. This is an evaluation of the relative marketability of the properties. 
                  c.  The relative quality of the proposed housing expressed in the minimum square footage of heated space, the size of the garage space, and the number and quality of additional amenities provided by the developer in the subdivision to improve its value and marketability. 
                  d.  As part of this evaluation, the city reserves the right not to incentivize any portion of a residential subdivision that is considerably more expensive to provide infrastructure to than the rest of the subdivision, due to geographic or other conditions. 
                  (8)  Any property owner wishing to participate in the single-family subdivision incentive program for the next fiscal year shall file with the city manager not later than April 15 preceding said fiscal year (which begins July 1), a letter requesting said participation, when the development will begin, a proposed subdivision sketch plan showing the lots and road configuration, and a statement of the minimum size of the houses' heated space, the size of the garage, and the number and quality of additional amenities provided by the developer in the proposed subdivision to improve its value and marketability. For fiscal year 2008 requests, the deadline shall be May 15, 2007, rather than April 15, 2007, as this is a new provision requiring more time for developers to timely make their applications in the first year. 
                  (Ord. of 12-4-01(1), § 1; Ord. No. 2007-10, §§ 1.a—d, 3-20-07) 
                  Sec. 62-2. - Subdivision incentives. 
                  The city will provide the incentives listed below for the portions of single-family residential subdivisions that are economically feasible on a per lot basis as noted in Sec. 62-1 g) 4) above, and that have been selected by the city council for participation in the residential single-family subdivision incentive program. 
                  (1)  The city will pay $250.00 per lot in an R-20 zoned development and $125.00 per lot in an R-15 zoned development toward the engineering design cost of the water and sewer system within the development, provided that the city must approve of the engineering firm selected to perform the work and its fees. Preference will be given to the engineering firm selected by the developer to design the subdivision provided that the firm is in good standing with the city and the engineering fees are within the normal range for similar engineering design services in the area. 
                  (2)  The city will pay 100 percent of the entire cost to install the water and sewer system within an R-20 or an R-15 zoned development, following review and comment on the proposed plans by the city's engineers. However, in an R-15 zoned development the developer must reimburse the city at the time of each lot sale, 50 percent of the cost to install the water and sewer system, divided by the number of lots in that subdivision phase. At the end of five years from the date of the final plat recordation of any subdivision phase, the developer shall pay the city said 50 percent reimbursement per lot for any lots still unsold. 
                  (3)  The city will pay $7.00 per linear foot in an R-20 zoned development, and $3.50 per linear foot in an R-15 zoned development to offset the cost for curb and gutter in the development, not including the necessary catch basins. The actual number of linear feet shall be calculated by the city engineer from the final plat of each subdivision phase. 
                  (4)  The city will pay $23.00 per square yard in an R-20 zoned development, and $11.50 per square yard in an R-15 zoned development to offset the cost for sidewalks on one side of each street within the development. This provision includes the installation of sidewalks around the entire circumference of any cul-de-sac in the development. The actual number of linear feet shall be calculated by the city engineer from the final plat of each subdivision phase. 
                  (5)  The city will install all street signs and traffic signs within the subdivision. 
                  (6)  The city will install the natural gas lines within the subdivision at no cost to the developer. The city reserves the right to delay actual connection if the nearest natural gas line is not within an economically feasible distance. 
                  (7)  The city will waive the ten percent greenspace requirement in section 86-62 given that these subdivisions will contain larger lots. 
                  (8)  Lots containing detached, semidetached or attached single-family residential structures where the structure is the principal use on an individual lot, are exempt from the clearing and tree provisions of the urban forest beautification and conservation ordinance (chapter 86), except for exceptional trees on such lots (section 86-29).

If an event is terminated pursuant to this subsection, the permit shall be permanently revoked. For purpose of this subsection (c), exceeding the number of projected attendees/participants shall not be considered a material deviation unless the number present exceeds the stated life safety or fire related capacity for an interior space or the maximum number of persons allowed for an exterior space as stated in the permit. 
                  (4)  It shall be unlawful for any person to violate the terms of the permit or to deviate from the plan submitted in the application for the permit.

                  Sec. 82-72. - Purpose. 
                  The mayor and city council have determined that an effective means of financing the installation of the major trunk water and sewer lines inside and adjacent to the city limits, is to finance the cost using a GEFA loan or revenue bond with a 20-year amortization period, and then to recoup most of the principal cost for said loan from a charge against each parcel or equivalent of such parcel. Said cost shall be determined based upon a detailed engineering study that includes an equitable mechanism for prorating the cost among all of the developable property (which excludes wetlands and road rights-of-way). As the property served by the major water and sewer trunk lines is developed, the fee would be paid into the water and sewer fund. 
                  (Ord. No. 2007-15, § 1, 5-15-07) 
                  Sec. 82-73. - Authorization. 
                  The mayor and city council hereby establish a capital cost recovery fee (CCR fee), to be charged in any capital cost recovery fee district created under section 82-74 below.

                  The mayor and city council may by resolution establish a CCR fee district, after receiving a detailed engineering study that identifies the sewer drainage basin to be served, and the water system necessary to service that drainage basin. The engineering study must provide a coherent, equitable methodology for apportioning the principal cost of the loan necessary to finance these major water and sewer lines between the various owners of the property, whether used for residential or commercial purposes. The initial costs to be imposed shall be as estimated for construction in the engineering study, and shown on the study's CCR fee district maps.

                  The mayor and city council may amend by resolution a CCR fee district whenever in their judgment the area needs to be enlarged or contracted, based upon the area to be served; or, to reflect the actual cost of construction once a major line has been installed. This will assure that the final cost of construction is the number used in computing the actual CCR fee. The estimated costs are for planning purposes, and represent the engineering firm's best estimate of construction costs.

                  Sec. 82-179. - Industrial wastewater surcharge. 
                  (a)  Established. All industrial contributors whose wastewater discharges exceed 200 milligrams per liter biochemical oxygen demand or 200 milligrams per liter suspended solids shall be assessed a surcharge in addition to the user charge. The charge shall be based on the proportionally higher biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids concentration the industry contributes to the wastewater treatment facility in excess of 200 milligrams per liter biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids. 
                  (b)  Basis. The annual operation and maintenance costs for each year will be allocated as follows: 
                  Flow Cost = 35% OandM Cost 
                  BOD Cost = 40% OandM Cost 
                  TSS Cost = 25% OandM Cost 
                  The expected average daily load at the plant for the subsequent year will be determined based on previous experience. 
                  (c)  Rate. The surcharge rate is determined as follows: 
                  BOD Surcharge/lb. =  BOD OandM Cost       365 × BOD lb./day plant 
                  TSS Surcharge/lb.  =  TSS OandM Cost       365 × TSS lb./day plant 
                  (d)  Calculation. The surcharge shall be calculated as follows: 
                  Surcharge = Q × 8.33 ((BODi - 200) × BODR + (TSSi - 200) × TSSR) 
                  Where: 

                   
                  (e)  Rate amendment. The surcharge rate will be analyzed annually at the same time as user charges are being reviewed, and if adjustment of the rates is justified new rates will be set by council action. 
                  (f)  Wastewater monitoring. No additional monitoring will be provided under this section. Results of analyses provided for under section 82-177 will be used to determine surcharges to the industry.

                  ARTICLE VII. - STORMWATER UTILITIES 

                  Sec. 82-260. - Purpose. 
                  This chapter is enacted for the purpose of establishing the stormwater utility and stormwater user fee system and other provisions relating thereto. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1, 1-6-15; Ord. No. 2015-12, § 1, 12-1-15) 
                  Sec. 82-261. - Findings of fact. 
                  The mayor and city council make the following findings of fact: 
                  (a)  The City of Statesboro is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III, and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management service systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the City of Statesboro (hereinafter "the city" or "Statesboro") and to collect fees for provision of those services. 
                  (b)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, the city is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city limits. 
                  (c)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff can result in: 
                  (1)  Erosion of lands, which could threaten businesses, residences, and other structures with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within, and downstream of, the city; 
                  (2)  Adverse affects to the city's sanitary sewer system operations thereby increasing the potential for infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system; 
                  (3)  Potential degradation of the quality of both surface water and ground water resources. 
                  (d)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding strategy for its stormwater management program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
                  (e)  The city desires to implement a storm water management program to address storm water runoff quality and quantity and to mitigate the impacts of pollution and flooding which may impact the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4), private property and downstream receiving waters of the State of Georgia and/or United States. 
                  (f)  Compliance with applicable regulatory obligations, including but not limited to, the city's National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) wastewater discharge permit; the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP); the Georgia Comprehensive Statewide Water Management Plan; the city's watershed assessment and watershed protection plan; and other applicable state and federal water resources related regulations as well as other identified stormwater management program needs will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for stormwater quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood plain management, capital drainage projects and other stormwater management program activities. 
                  (g)  The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services provided by the city's stormwater management program and the demand imposed by improved property on the city's drainage system and stormwater management program. 
                  (h)  The stormwater management program assessment and financial analysis performed by the city's consultant properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
                  (i)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned stormwater program assessment and financial analysis, it is appropriate that the city authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of storm water management services, systems, and facilities within the city in concert with other water resources management programs. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved/developed properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature. 
                  (j)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is appropriate given the present and future needs of the city. 
                  (k)  The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners and/or tenants of improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management systems and facilities which result in services to such properties and the owners and/or tenants thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the stormwater user fee charge correlates to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the city stormwater management program. 
                  (l)  Stormwater management needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service to customers and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways although the benefits may be indirect or immeasurable. 
                  (m)  A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city. The imposition of a stormwater user fee charge is the most equitable means to allocate the costs to users of the stormwater management services and to generate revenue to implement the defined level of service for the city's stormwater management program. 
                  (n)  The presence and amount of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the stormwater runoff contribution of that property; the corresponding demand the property imposes on the stormwater management program; and the cost of providing stormwater management services to that property by the city. Therefore, the amount of impervious surface on each property is the most significant parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge; and the city deems it appropriate to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public drainage system whether the property is private or public in nature. 
                  (o)  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based primarily on the amount of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Stormwater utility user fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity, as well as customer understanding of the user fee charge rate structure, while at the same time minimizing the city's customer account management and maintenance efforts. 
                  (p)  Stormwater utility user fee charges may be supplemented by other funding which addresses specific needs, including, but not limited to, special district service fees, general fund allocations, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
                  (q)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site stormwater control facilities, activities or assets which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of a particular property on the city's stormwater management program, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property in the form of a credit, and such credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property. 
                  (r)  It is required that the revenue proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes. Such user fee revenue proceeds, and other supplemental revenues, shall be deposited into the City of Statesboro Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund. The user fee proceeds and other supplemental revenues shall remain in the enterprise fund, and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital improvements, facilities, equipment, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments, debt service payments, or other indebtedness related to the stormwater management program. 
                  (s)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Statesboro hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility, as the best available means of addressing the foregoing stormwater management program needs and priorities. By means of this article, the city will enact a stormwater user fee rate structure and a procedure for the establishment of a user fee charge billing rate related to the provision of stormwater management services. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1, 1-6-15; Ord. No. 2015-12, § 1, 12-1-15) 
                  Sec. 82-262. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act codified at 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq., and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto.

                  Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater runoff collects, remains, diverts, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's topography, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater characteristics, the parcel's on-site operations, the parcel's stormwater controls, the parcel's antecedent moisture as well as the parcel's geologic and hydro-geologic characteristics. 
                  Impervious area shall mean and have the same definition as impervious surface. 
                  Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development and causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered/undeveloped natural condition. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces such as compacted soil and gravel, which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development.

                  Parcel shall mean a designated parcel or tract, established by plat, subdivision, or as otherwise permitted by law, to be separately owned, used, developed, or built upon. 
                  Partial impervious surface shall mean those areas which allow for limited infiltration of rainfall and surface water runoff into the soil in the manner that is more similar to natural conditions than "impervious surface" as defined above. Partial impervious surfaces influence and affect stormwater runoff such that the runoff is collected, concentrated and/or flows in a manner that is materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. Common partial impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, compacted gravel and/or compacted soils. 
                  Private stormwater management systems and facilities shall mean those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainageways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm drains, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff or water quality, for which operation and maintenance is the responsibility of the owner or successor or assignee thereof, and which have not been conveyed or dedicated to the city for future maintenance. 
                  Public stormwater management systems and facilities (or the city's municipal separate storm sewer system ) shall mean that portion of the drainage system consisting of natural and/or man-made structures, within the political boundaries of the city which channel or convey storm water from its point of collection to a point of discharge, owned by the city, over which the city has a legal right of access, have been formally dedicated to and accepted by the city for maintenance, or over which the city exercises dominion and control.

                  Sec. 82-263. - Stormwater utility and enterprise fund established. 
                  (a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility to be known as the City of Statesboro Stormwater Utility, which shall be responsible for stormwater management services throughout the incorporated area of the city, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the city's stormwater management systems and facilities and stormwater management program services. 
                  (b)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility enterprise fund in the city accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding generated by the stormwater utility user fee charge to the operation of the stormwater management program and stormwater utility, including, but not limited to, rates, charges, and fees as may be established by the mayor and city council from time to time, and other funds that may be allocated to the stormwater utility. Such fund shall be both an enterprise fund and a fiduciary fund, consistent with the definitions within this article. 
                  (c)  All revenues and receipts generated from the storm water user fee charges shall be segregated and placed into the stormwater utility enterprise fund in trust, and be expended solely for stormwater management purposes; provided, however, such fund may also pay a reasonable allocation of costs provided to the stormwater utility by the city's general fund, or other utilities of the city, in order to account for application overhead costs. Stormwater utility user fee charge revenue shall be used only for the operating expenses and/or capital investments of the stormwater utility. However, other forms of revenue and/or financial resources, not accounted for in the stormwater utility user fee revenue, may be allocated as deemed appropriate by the city, to provide supplemental funding to the stormwater management program and stormwater management services. 
                  (d)  Under the supervision and oversight of the city manager, the city shall place responsibility with the stormwater utility manager for operation, maintenance and regulation of the stormwater utility and stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated, or maintained by the city, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties, other than road rights-of-way, upon which such stormwater management systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1, 1-6-15; Ord. No. 2015-12, § 1, 12-1-15) 
                  Sec. 82-264. - Stormwater utility service area. 
                  (a)  There shall be one stormwater utility service area in the city which shall encompass the municipal boundaries of Statesboro. The city has established that all developed parcels within the municipal boundaries receive stormwater management program services from the city. Improved/developed properties within the defined service area will receive a stormwater user fee charge bill because they contribute stormwater runoff to the public drainage system, are directly or indirectly connected to the city's drainage system, and/or receive stormwater management services from the city to varying degrees. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1, 1-6-15; Ord. No. 2015-12, § 1, 12-1-15) 
                  Sec. 82-265. - Scope of responsibility for stormwater management systems and facilities. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility shall provide stormwater management services for existing and proposed public stormwater management systems and facilities as defined in this article, subject to funding availability and policy considerations made in the best interest of the public health, safety and general welfare, and of the environment. Additionally, the stormwater utility may accept the responsibility for providing stormwater management services to private stormwater management systems and facilities, acceptance of which conforms to policies established by the mayor and city council. 
                  (b)  The city owns in fee simple, or has legal rights established by written agreements, which allow it to operate, maintain, improve, and access those stormwater management systems and facilities which are located: 
                  (1)  On property owned by, or within the possession and control of, the city; 
                  (2)  Within public rights-of-way of the municipal street system and, where the city has by agreement with the county or state agreed to maintain public roads and highways on the county road system and/or state highway system; 
                  (3)  On private property but within legally dedicated easements granted to, and accepted by, the city; 
                  (4)  On private property where the city has been granted, by written agreements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other provisions for operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management system facilities located thereon; or 
                  (5)  On public land which is owned by another governmental entity with whom the city has a written agreement providing for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon. 
                  (c)  Operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater management systems and facilities which are located on private or public property not owned by the city, and for which there has been no written agreement granting easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other form of dedication thereof to the city for operation, maintenance, improvement and access of such stormwater management systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner and/or tenant, except as otherwise provided for by state and federal laws and regulations. 
                  (d)  The stormwater utility may provide periodic inspection, testing, or engineering assessment of privately owned stormwater management systems and facilities to ascertain that said facilities are functioning as designed and approved. After notice to the property owner, the stormwater utility may provide for remedial maintenance of said private facilities based upon the severity of stormwater problems and potential hazard to the public health, safety, and welfare and the environment. In cases where such remedial maintenance is required to be performed by the city, the city shall have the right to bill the owner of said private facility for the costs of such maintenance, and impose a lien against the property to enforce collection. 
                  (e)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any person or entity, or to any specific property within or outside the municipal boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the city, its elected officials, officers, employees, and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship. 
                  (f)  If any permit, plan approval, inspection, or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any land disturbance or construction activity upon property not owned by the city pursuant to this or any other regulatory code, ordinance, regulation or rule of the city, or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit, negligent issuance of a permit, negligent plan approval, negligent construction of permitted system or facility, or negligent maintenance of any permitted stormwater management system or facility not expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city for further maintenance in an action seeking the imposition of money damages or equitable remedies against the city, its mayor and city council members, officers, employees or agents.

                  Sec. 82-266. - Stormwater utility customer classes. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility shall establish specified customer classes within the service area to reflect differences in impervious surface and stormwater runoff characteristics; stormwater management program services provided by the city to the stormwater utility customers; and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city stormwater management program and drainage system components. All publicly owned developed properties, other than streets or roads, are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties. The stormwater utility classes will encompass all developed and undeveloped properties within the city and are defined as follows: 
                  (1)  The single family residential (SFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as SFR customers per the applicable definition. 
                  (2)  The non-single family residential (NSFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as NSFR customers per the applicable definition. 
                  (3)  The undeveloped class shall consist of properties classified as undeveloped per the applicable definition. 
                  (b)  Documentation pertaining to the stormwater utility customer classes shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater utility manager for public inspection. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1, 1-6-15; Ord. No. 2015-12, § 1, 12-1-15) 
                  Sec. 82-267. - Stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (a)  It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service area shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services by the city. 
                  (b)  The basis for calculation of the stormwater user fee charge for developed properties within the city is established in this article. The city shall assign or determine the customer class, amount of impervious area and other pertinent factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the costs to deliver stormwater management services and to calculate the stormwater user fee charges for developed properties in the city. 
                  (c)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a reasonable connection, or rational nexus, to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city as defined herein. 
                  (d)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners and/or tenants which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities, or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities. 
                  (e)  The stormwater user fee charges shall accrue beginning June 1, 2015 and be billed in arrears each month to customers. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1, 1-6-15; Ord. No. 2015-12, § 1, 12-1-15) 
                  Sec. 82-268. - Stormwater user fee charge billing rates. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility shall impose a stormwater user fee charge on all developed properties within the service area in accordance with the provisions of this article. The stormwater utility shall apportion the cost of delivering stormwater services to all developed properties based on the demand the property places on the city's stormwater management program, the stormwater services provided by the city and the benefits derived by the property as a result of the provision of services. 
                  (b)  The mayor and city council shall establish by resolution the stormwater user fee charge rates, and the billing rates may be modified by the mayor and city council from time to time to meet the financial and operational needs of the Statesboro Stormwater Utility. A current schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk of Statesboro. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and which, together with other funding sources available to the Statesboro Stormwater Utility for services, systems, and/or facilities related to stormwater management are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management program, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other stormwater utility related costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  (c)  Stormwater user fee charges shall be based upon the total number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) associated with developed properties within the city. Each ERU shall correspond to 3,200 square feet of impervious surface. 
                  (d)  Gravel and compacted soil driveways, parking areas, and roads on private property will be considered partial impervious surface and included in the customer's ERU calculation because of the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. However, the total surface area associated with these materials will be calculated at 85 percent of the total ERUs to reflect the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. 
                  (e)  Calculation of user fee charges. The periodic stormwater user fee charges imposed on all developed properties shall be calculated by multiplying the stormwater user fee billing rate (per ERU) times the number of ERUs for each customer account. The number of ERUs that will be utilized to calculate the user fee charge for each customer account shall be in general accordance with the following: 
                  (1)  SFR customer class: Each SFR customer account shall be charged 1.0 ERU per month unless the conditions outlined below applies. 
                  a.  If two customer accounts are assigned to a SFR property (i.e. a duplex) then each customer account on that parcel will be charged 0.5 ERU per month for billing purposes. 
                  (2)  NSFR customer class: Each NSFR customer shall be charged 1.0 ERU for each 3,200 square feet, or increment thereof, of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs will be rounded to one decimal place to establish the number of ERUs for billing each month. 
                  (3)  Undeveloped land customer class: Undeveloped land shall be assigned 0 ERUs and will not receive a stormwater user fee bill. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1, 1-6-15; Ord. No. 2015-12, § 1, 12-1-15) 
                  Sec. 82-269. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions. 
                  (a)  Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no developed public or private property located in the incorporated area of the city, containing more than 500 square feet of impervious surface, shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. The stormwater utility user fee charge is not a tax and no exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion, disability, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management program services and facilities. 
                  (b)  Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows: 
                  (1)  Parcels which contain 500 square feet, or less, of impervious surfaces or partial impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (2)  Linear railroad rights-of-way (i.e. tracks, rails, rail bed) outside of the defined rail yard limits shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities undertaken by the rail road company associated with rights-of-way and drainage conveyance systems. However, railroad stations, rail yards, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad operations shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (3)  City of Statesboro streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. The stormwater utility shall not charge the city a user fee charge for the impervious surface associated with city's streets and other impervious surfaces within the rights-of-way of the city's municipal street system. This exemption is granted in consideration of the city allowing the stormwater utility to utilize the city's existing streets, curbs, gutters, drainage ways and ditches, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural and man-made, within and owned by the city which controls, diverts, and conveys surface water for the purposes of collecting, diverting, transporting and controlling surface runoff and storm waters. All other developed property owned by the city shall be subject to the imposition of stormwater user fee charges in accordance with this article. 
                  (4)  Bulloch County roads and rights-of-way on the county road system located within the city limits shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges inasmuch as Bulloch County has legal responsibility to perform all drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities with respect to such roads and rights-of-way. This exemption is in recognition of the drainage system maintenance and capital construction responsibilities undertaken by Bulloch County. All other developed property owned by Bulloch County that is within the service area shall be subject to the imposition of stormwater user fee charges in accordance with this article. 
                  (5)  Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) highways, federal interstates, and rights-of-way on the state highway system within the city limits shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance, NPDES regulatory compliance, and capital construction activities undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way road and drainage conveyance systems. However, offices, maintenance buildings, and/or other developed property used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (6)  Publicly owned developed property of the federal and state governments, their departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and authorities, shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges under this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1, 1-6-15; Ord. No. 2015-12, § 1, 12-1-15) 
                  Sec. 82-270. - Stormwater user fee charge credits. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility manager may grant credits or adjustments based on the technical and procedural criteria set forth in the City of Statesboro Stormwater Utility Credit Manual (credit manual), which is incorporated into this article by reference and made a part hereof. Copies of the credit manual will be maintained by and made available from the stormwater utility manager. 
                  (1)  Customers may apply for credits and/or adjustments in accordance with the credit manual. 
                  (2)  A stormwater user fee charge credit shall be determined based upon meeting all technical requirements, standards and criteria contained in the credit manual. The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the credit manual. 
                  (3)  Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance, including proper future maintenance of the stormwater management systems and facilities with design and performance standards as stated in the credit manual and upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the customer. The stormwater utility manager may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the credit manual or this article. 
                  (4)  In order to obtain a credit, the customer must make application to the city on forms provided by the stormwater utility manager for such purpose, and in accordance with the procedures outlined in the credit manual. 
                  (5)  The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, and be in the format described in the credit manual. The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to review and approval of a stormwater utility credit application by the city. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for consideration and processing. 
                  (b)  When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the stormwater utility manager, he shall have 30 days from the date the complete application is received to approve the credit in whole, approve the credit in part, or deny the credit. The stormwater utility manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. Credits applied for by the customer and approved in whole or in part, shall apply to all stormwater user fee charges in accordance with the terms defined in the credit manual. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1, 1-6-15; Ord. No. 2015-12, § 1, 12-1-15) 
                  Sec. 82-271. - Stormwater user fee charge billing; delinquencies and collections; and adjustments. 
                  (a)  Billing. The property owner or utility customer account holder, as identified from city public utility billing database information, Tax Digest and other public records of Bulloch County, shall be obligated to pay the applicable stormwater user fee charge. 
                  (1)  Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue June 1, 2015, and shall be billed in arrears on the customer's monthly public utility bill thereafter beginning in the July 2015 billing cycle. 
                  (2)  The stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected on a combined utility bill and collected along with other city utility services from the person in whose name such services have been placed on account with the city. If and when the account is closed or becomes delinquent, the bills for unpaid previous service as well as for current and future service shall be reverted to the property owner. 
                  (3)  Customers that do not have another utility service shall receive a utility bill with stormwater user fees only or shall be billed via another method and frequency established by the city. 
                  (4)  The city reserves the right to bill the stormwater user fee charge to either the property owner or the utility customer account holder (i.e. the tenant) as described herein. 
                  a.  The city shall have the authority to bill the property owner's tenant for the stormwater user fee charge in situations where the tenant has opened an account with the city for public utility services; provided, however, the property owner shall remain ultimately liable for payment of the stormwater user fee charge imposed on the property. 
                  b.  The city shall be authorized to bill the landlord or property owner for stormwater services where accurate and equitable apportionment of the user fee charges to multiple accounts on a parcel is not practical as determined by the city, and/or to facilitate efficient billing and collection of customer stormwater user fee charges. For example, the user fee charge for multi-family properties, i.e. properties with more than two units, may be billed to the property owner, landlord or property management company. 
                  (5)  Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by the mayor and city council. 
                  (6)  Failure of the customer to receive a utility bill or a stormwater user fee charge shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the property owner of each developed property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be ultimately obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments. 
                  (7)  If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of developed property, the stormwater utility may back bill for a period of up to three years, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period. 
                  (b)  Delinquencies and collections. 
                  (1)  The stormwater utility user fee charge shall be billed and collected as an integral part of the city's billing for other utility services and the customer may not elect to separate such fee from the remainder of the utility bill for nonpayment. If the customer fails to include payment of the stormwater utility user fee charge portion of the utility bill when the utility bill is paid, or otherwise separates the stormwater utility user fee charge from the remainder of the bill for nonpayment, the entire billing will be in default notwithstanding any other payment made towards the bill, and, in addition to all other remedies which the city may have for nonpayment, any or all other utility services, including water service, may be terminated on the date printed on the bill in accordance with the procedures established in the City Code of Ordinances for such termination. Acceptance and retention by the city of any portion of the utility bill shall not constitute a waiver of the foregoing provisions. 
                  (2)  All bills not paid by the due date are subject to the late payment charge, as approved by resolution of the mayor and city council. In addition, all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, will be added. 
                  (3)  Unpaid stormwater service fees may also be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any civil judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner or the property. 
                  (4)  In the event of non-payment and service cut-off, the customer must pay the bill in full, the late payment charge, a cut-off charge if applicable, and pay a deposit if it was either waived, previously refunded, or was used to make the payment, late payment charge, and/or the cut-off charge. The city manager is authorized to work out a payment plan for customers that demonstrate the ability to pay. Such a payment plan can only be entered into once in a 12-month period. Failure to meet any payment date of a payment plan shall terminate the payment plan, and the services shall be discontinued. 
                  (c)  Adjustments. The stormwater utility manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge. 
                  (1)  If a customer believes his stormwater user fee charge amount is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge for the account at any time by submitting the request in writing to the stormwater utility manager and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to consideration of an adjustment request by the city. 
                  (2)  Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide accurate impervious area and other supplemental information to the stormwater utility manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer or as otherwise allowed by the stormwater utility manager. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater utility manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the customer's adjustment request. 
                  (3)  Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater utility manager, the stormwater utility manager shall within 30 calendar days render a written decision. 
                  (4)  In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater utility manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater user fee charge for the account is correct. 
                  (5)  The stormwater utility manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
                  (6)  If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater user fee charge bill. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1, 1-6-15; Ord. No. 2015-12, § 1, 12-1-15) 
                  Sec. 82-272. - Appeals and hearings. 
                  (a)  Appeals. An appeal to the city manager may be taken by any customer aggrieved by any decision of the stormwater utility manager. The appeal shall be taken within 30 calendar days of the decision of the stormwater utility manager by filing with the city manager a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the stormwater utility manager shall forthwith transmit to the city manager all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken. 
                  (b)  Hearings. The city manager shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall indicate the place, date and time of the hearing. The city manager shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the stormwater utility manager after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the stormwater utility manager is reversed in whole or in part, resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner or customer, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal. The decision of the city manager shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative appeal. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the city manager may petition the Superior Court of Bulloch County for writ of certiorari .

                  Sec. 86-26. - Title. 
                  This article shall be known as the "Urban Forest Beautification and Conservation Ordinance of the City of Statesboro, Georgia." 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-13, 12-6-11) 
                  Sec. 86-27. - Jurisdiction. 
                  The provisions of this article shall apply to all lands within the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-13, 12-6-11) 
                  Sec. 86-28. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  The purpose of this article is to: 
                  (1)  Protect the aesthetic quality provided by the natural tree cover on tracts of land being converted to urban development. 
                  (2)  Protect and enhance the aesthetic quality provided by street and park trees. 
                  (3)  Prevent soil erosion. 
                  (4)  Prevent reductions in the drainage holding capacity of land. 
                  (5)  Prevent increases and promote reductions in air pollution and carbon dioxide levels in the air. 
                  (6)  Consistent with the expressed purpose of this article, all persons shall make reasonable efforts to preserve and retain certain existing, self-supporting trees as defined herein. It is also the intent of this article that all applicable sites within the city maintain or obtain a 35 percent minimum tree canopy, as defined and explained herein. 
                  (b)  Minimum canopy requirements. 
                  (1)  A basic condition of the Urban Forest Beautification and Conservation Ordinance of the City of Statesboro is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree canopy of 35 percent. Applicable sites except those exempted under section 86-29 of this chapter, for this section, include but are not limited to: 
                  a.  Parks and public grounds; 
                  b.  Any activity requiring issuance of a land disturbance permit is carried out; 
                  c.  Commercial development; 
                  The canopy requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development or disturbance of the applicable site. The canopy may be achieved by preserving existing trees, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards in this chapter or by a combination of the two. Minimum tree canopy shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in Appendix 1 to this chapter. Any existing tree (acceptable species) of four inches or greater DBH left in good growing condition on the property is eligible to be counted toward the minimum required canopy. If a preserved tree is counted towards the required tree canopy it must be properly protected. The property owner shall be subject to the minimum tree canopy requirement set forth in this section. The property owner shall base the canopy calculation on the gross site area. 
                  (2)  Trees replanted to achieve canopy requirements are to be selected species from the City of Statesboro, Tree Species Selection List set forth in Appendix 6 (which will list values of canopy coverage in square feet for various groups of trees and minimum area for planting), on file with the city. In addition, replanting shall be at the ratio of not less than one overstory tree for every three understory trees. Canopy credit may be met by planting all overstory trees, but not by planting only understory trees. All replacement trees will be maintained properly to ensure their survivability. 
                  (c)  Canopy recovery plan. 
                  (1)  Development plans shall include a canopy recovery plan for replacement of trees and vegetation approved for removal. A canopy recovery plan shall include the following: 
                  a.  Areas to be cleared and areas preserved; 
                  b.  The number of trees required for replacement, to achieve 35% canopy coverage. 
                  (2)  In order to promote diversity, no more than 25 percent of the replacement trees shall be of the same species; 
                  (3)  Where the city representative determines that a site cannot sustainably support the required replacement, due to the size and shape and/or structures and/or other viable site constraints, a fee shall be paid to the City of Statesboro Tree Bank. This fee shall be the actual and verified cost of the required tree replacement and shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy; and 
                  (4)  If a property owner has preserved extensive overstory trees and clusters of native trees and vegetation, in such a manner as to provide extensive shading within the built environment, value shall be 100 percent of the drip line area of groupings, excluding wetlands. An exhibit depicting the aforementioned shall be submitted that calculates the canopy spread based on DBH and species of a tree. 
                  (d)  Alternative compliance to canopy density requirement. 
                  (1)  One of the intentions of this chapter is to ensure that a minimum canopy density of trees is maintained on all applicable sites, as defined in this chapter. If this intent cannot be met because a site will not bear the required density of trees (determined by the city's representative and confirmed by the city's tree board), contributing to the City of Statesboro Tree Bank may be an acceptable method of compliance. 
                  (2)  The following standards have been established for administering these alternative compliance methods. The city representative must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall more than 60 percent of the required site canopy be met through alternative compliance. The site in question must be planted with as many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive. 
                  (3)  No development approval (as defined by this ordinance), land disturbance permit, or building permit shall be issued until the city representative has approved the request and received the necessary documentation and/or funds for the alternative compliance method. 
                  (4)  As a method of alternative compliance, the City of Statesboro will accept donations to the City of Statesboro Tree Bank. These donations will be used for the sole purpose of planting trees on public property within the City of Statesboro. For calculating contributions to the City of Statesboro Tree Bank, see Appendix 2 of this chapter. 
                  (5)  The City of Statesboro Tree Bank will be administered by the designated City representative. An annual report shall be submitted to the City of Statesboro City Manager showing amounts collected, amounts spent, and the type and location of trees planted.

                  (1)  Greenspace. A minimum of 15 percent of the total area of any development, including all buildable areas, shall be devoted to greenspace; i.e., for every one acre in the total area of the development fifteen-hundredths acre (6,534 square feet) shall be reserved as greenspace. 
                  a.  The 15 percent minimum greenspace requirement is calculated from the total area of the development. 
                  b.  Required buffers: Existing trees in required buffer zones can be counted in the total calculations of tree canopy required for the development. 
                  c.  Out parcel development is subject to all requirements contained in this article and shall not be permitted without prior approval. 
                  (2)  Tree density. Each greenspace shall have a tree canopy density of at least 15,246 square feet of canopy for every 43,560 square feet of greenspace (35 percent). 
                  (3)  Canopy area requirement. The total canopy area requirement (CARs) required may consist of a combination of canopy area for preserved trees and planted trees. 
                  (4)  Paved surfaces. If the total of all paved surface areas in the development is 10,000 square feet or greater, then a minimum of 15 percent of the paved surface area must be in greenspace. 
                  a.  The greenspace within paved surface areas must be distributed in islands or peninsulas within and throughout the paved surface areas. Tree islands and peninsulas shall be placed no more than ten consecutive parking spaces apart. 
                  b.  This paved area must have a tree density of at least 50 percent tree canopy. 
                  c.  The canopy area requirements within the paved surface areas shall count towards the canopy area requirements for the total area of the development. 
                  (5)  Trees in poor condition. Trees in poor condition are not eligible for canopy area requirements. A tree shall be determined to be in poor condition upon evaluation by the tree board and/or the city engineering department using guidelines set forth in the Best Management Practices Manual resource material, which is incorporated in this article and which is available in the office of the city engineering department and city tree manager. 
                  (6)  Canopy area requirement for preserved trees. The canopy area requirement for a preserved tree is calculated by measuring canopy coverage of all trees saved. Preserved trees may only count for up to 60 percent of minimum canopy area requirement. Unacceptable species or trees (acceptable species) less than four inches will not be assigned canopy coverage area. 
                  (7)  Canopy area requirement for planted trees. The canopy area requirements for a planted tree are assigned based upon mature tree size. Refer to Table No. 1, for the canopy area requirement assigned to each category of planted tree, and to the land clearing and tree protection manual for further information. No one species shall make up over 25 percent of the total number of trees planted. 
                  Table No. 1 

                   
                  (8)  Unacceptable species. Unacceptable species as listed in the tree species guidelines incorporated in this article will not be assigned canopy area requirement. Reference shall be made to the tree species list Appendix 7. 
                  (9)  Minimum caliper. The minimum caliper (measured at six inches above the ground) for planted trees is two inches. Multi-stemmed trees must have three to four stems and be six to eight feet tall. Refer to the tree species list located in the manual for information on the mature size of a specific species. 
                  (10)  Protection of preserved or planted trees. All preserved and/or planted trees shall be protected from land disturbance resulting from any building or facility construction. 
                  (11)  Maintenance of minimum tree canopy requirements. The required minimum tree canopy requirements must be maintained on the site as living trees for the life of the development.

                  Sec. 86-63. - Tree protection and tree establishment. 
                  (a)  Protection of preserved trees. Tree protection zones shall be established and maintained for all preserved trees. The following provisions apply to such zones and trees within them: 
                  (1)  A tree protection plan shall accompany all applications identifying how existing trees within tree protection zones are to be protected during clearing and construction of the project. Such plan shall be approved by the city engineering department when it is determined that the plan adequately addresses the criteria set forth in the Best Management Practices Manual. The tree protection plan may be either a separate plan or included as part of the greenspace plan. This plan will be reviewed by the city engineering or his designee. For projects four acres or more, this plan shall be developed by either a landscape architect, certified arborist or a horticulturist. 
                  (2)  Standards for protected tree preservation in preparation of building plans and during development, demolition, and construction. 
                  a.  Before plans are submitted for permit, the city engineering department or designee is to be consulted before any permanent structure or impervious paving is constructed within the tree protection area. 
                  1.  A tree protection barrier plan shall be provided illustrating how trees located on or adjacent to the subject property will be protected from any adverse effects of proposed construction or grade changes. The plan must include the tree protection barrier that will be installed. 
                  2.  If a major root of any protected tree affected by a grade change visibly extends beyond its drip line, then city engineering department or designee may require additional root protection. 
                  3.  Prior to demolition and/or construction, a tree protection barrier shall be placed and maintained as necessary to prevent damaging protected trees on, or adjacent to the subject property. Shield Critical Tree Protection Zone: Active protective barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely surrounding the critical tree protection zones of all specimen trees or stands of trees, and otherwise designated tree save areas, prior to any land disturbances. The tree save areas shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree(s) canopy as defined by the farthest canopy dripline of the tree(s). Refer to Appendix 3—Critical Root Zone. 
                  4.  Tree protection barriers are to be placed at or beyond the tree's drip line whenever possible. At no time shall the tree protection barrier(s) be closer than ten feet from a trunk unless existing or proposed structures are within that range. Refer to Appendix 4—Tree Protection. 
                  (3)  No vehicles shall be parked, construction material stored or substances poured or disposed of or placed, within any tree protection zone at any time during clearing or construction of the project. 
                  (4)  No application of an herbicide, defoliant, or pre-emergent to any tree without first obtaining a permit. 
                  (5)  Where clearing has been approved, trees shall be removed in a manner that does not physically impact the trees to be preserved. Felling trees into tree save areas shall be treated as a violation and shall be punishable in accordance with this chapter. 
                  (6)  No change in grade within the tree protection zone shall be allowed except for a maximum addition of two inches of sandy loamy topsoil covered with sod or mulch. 
                  a.  Before any grade changes involving the removal of any soil, the property owner or permittee shall: 
                  1.  Leave the area within the drip-line at its original grade with terraces by use of dry retaining walls at the drip-line that are constructed to allow for drainage and aeration; 
                  2.  Cut roots cleanly and re-trim them after excavation; 
                  3.  Cover exposed root system and keep moist; 
                  4.  Irrigate tree to compensate for root loss. 
                  b.  Violations of this section will result in a citation of $350.00 per protected tree per day. 
                  (7)  Precautions required for excavation and paving around protected trees. 
                  a.  Whenever possible, water, sewer, and other underground utility lines shall be routed around the drip-lines of protected trees. 
                  b.  If compliance with subsection (a) is impossible, then tunneling or directional boring for the utility shall be routed under the protected tree's root system to prevent damage to major roots. Mechanical trenching is prohibited. 
                  c.  Suitable pervious pavement may be placed within the drip-line of a protected tree as long as the tree is not damaged by grade change, soil compaction, or any other cause. There is to be no disturbance to the trunk root flair. 
                  d.  Violations of this section will result in a citation of $350.00 per protected tree per day. 
                  (8)  Buffer trees shall also be protected and included in tree save areas. 
                  (9)  Upon request by the applicant, the use of pervious pavers shall be allowed upon approval by the city engineering department if it is determined the following conditions exist: 
                  a.  The pavers cannot be counted in the total percent of greenspace; and 
                  b.  If the use shall not restrict the water supply or root system of planted or existing trees. 
                  (b)  Protection of planted trees. Tree establishment zones shall be established by the developer and maintained for all planted trees by the landowner, leaseholder and/or developer. The following provisions apply to such zones and trees within them: 
                  (1)  Any planted tree must have a minimum tree establishment zone based upon its mature size (see tree species list for mature size). The minimum size tree establishment zone centered upon the planted tree shall be as specified below and detailed further in the Best Management Practices Manual:

                  APPENDIX 1. - SQUARE FOOTAGE EXAMPLES 
                  Example 1: Following site to be developed: 
                  Step 1: 10 acre site = 435,600 square feet. 
                  Step 2: 35 percent canopy cover figure. 
                  435,600 × 0.35 = 152,460 square feet to meet 35 percent canopy cover. 
                  Step 3: Preserved trees left on site = 65,340 square feet (1.5 acres). 
                  152,460 minus 65,340 = 87,120 square feet of replacement trees. 
                  Step  4: Replacement trees required to meet 35 percent CR (canopy area requirement). 
                  CR = Canopy area requirement. 
                  ⇒ 87,120 square feet of area to be planted in trees. 
                  a.  Overstory trees = 1,500 square feet/tree planted. 
                  ✓  48 overstory (large canopy trees) × 1,500 square feet= 72,000 square feet. 
                  ✓  24 overstory (medium canopy trees) × 550 square feet = 13,200 square feet. 
                  ✓  Total square feet = 85,200 square feet. 
                  b.  Understory trees = 250 square feet/tree planted. 
                  ✓  12 understory (small canopy trees) × 250 square feet = 3,000 square feet. 
                  c.  Total square footage of trees planted: 88,200 square feet. 
                  THE 88,200 SQUARE FEET OF PLANTED TREES HAS MET 35 PERCENT CANOPY AREA REQUIREMENT 
                  and 
                  THE PRESERVED TREE AREA (65,340 square feet) DOES NOT EXCEED 60 PERCENT OF THE MINIMUM CANOPY AREA REQUIRED (152,450 square feet).

                  APPENDIX 2. - CITY OF STATESBORO TREE BANK FORMULA FOR DETERMINING CONTRIBUTIONS 
                  Contribution calculations are based on two-inch caliper replacement trees with a value updated annually, and on file with the city, representing the average size and cost of materials, labor and guarantee for trees planted in the City of Statesboro area. 
                  Example: Based on unit value of tree replacement of $500.00 (amount subject to change). 
                  To determine the appropriate canopy requirement ( CR ) contribution, first calculate the implantable square footage (ISF) of tree space which cannot be planted on the site. 
                  Divide the ISF by 1,500 square feet (the square foot value of a two-inch caliper overstory replacement tree) and multiply by $500.00. 
                  Example 2: The total square feet of 35 percent CR required is 43,560 square feet. 
                  Due to space limitation and other site problems, the site only has 29,000 square feet of plantable area (PA) for replacement trees. 
                  To determine the CR trees not plant able on site use the following formula: 
                  ISF = CR - PA 
                  In this example: 
                  CR (43,560 square feet) - PA (29,000 square feet) = 14,560 square feet of ISF. 
                  CR = ISF ÷ 1,500 square feet. 
                  CR = 14,560 ÷ 1,500 square feet = 9.707 replacement trees. 
                  This means the developer must contribute to the City of Statesboro Tree Bank the value of ten trees. 
                  Determine the acceptable contribution amount as follows: 
                  10 × $500.00 = $5,000.00 TOTAL CONTRIBUTION TO TREE BANK

                  APPENDIX 3. - CITY OF STATESBORO CRITICAL ROOT ZONE (CRZ) 

                  To calculate critical root zone radius, begin by measuring the diameter at breast height (DBH). This is done by measuring the tree's trunk diameter (thickness) at a point 4.5 feet above the ground. The measurement should be done in inches. For each inch of DBH, allow for 1.5 feet of critical root radius for significant or sensitive trees, or 1.0 feet for tolerant trees. For example, if a tree's DBH is 10 inches, then its critical root radius is 15 feet (10 × 1.5 = 15). The PRZ is an area around the tree with a diameter of 30 feet (2 × radius) and is the area in which a critical amount of the tree's roots may be found. Whenever possible, isolate this area from construction disturbance. 
                  Approximate a tree's protected root zone by calculating the critical root radius (crr). First, measure the tree diameter in inches at breast height (DBH). Then multiply that number by 1.5 or 1.0. Express the result in feet. 
                  Example: 
                  dbh = 8 inches 
                  8 × 1.5 = 12 
                  crr = 12 feet 
                  Measure diameter (width) = dbh

                  Section 301. - Zoning map. 
                  The existing zoning map was adopted by motion of July 7, 1987 and made a part of the ordinance designated as "Zoning Map of the City of Statesboro". That zoning map is being supplemented by a new zoning map for the City of Statesboro which is incorporated in and made a part of this ordinance [this appendix] and shall become the new zoning map of the City of Statesboro on the date of the adoption of this amendment. 
                  (Amd. of 12-4-01(3), § 2) 
                  Section 302. - District boundaries. 
                  The boundaries between districts are, unless otherwise indicated, either the centerlines of streets, lanes, watercourses, rights-of-way of power lines and other public utilities or such lines extended or lines parallel thereto. Where the boundaries of a single district are indicated as including directly opposite sides of a street, lane, lake or watercourse, or right-of-way of a power line of [or] other public utility, for any portion of its length, the district so indicated shall be construed to apply to the entire bed of such street, lane, lake or watercourse, or right-of-way of such power line, railroad or other public utility, lying within such portion of its length. Where uncertainty exists as to the location of any [of] said boundaries as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
                  A.  Where a district boundary is indicated as approximately following the centerline of a street, lane, lake or watercourse, or right-of-way of a power line or other public utility, such centerline shall be construed to be such boundary. 
                  B.  Where a district boundary is indicated as approximately following a lot line or other property line, such lot line shall be construed to be such boundary. 
                  C.  Where a district boundary divides a lot or runs through undivided property, the location of such boundary, unless otherwise specified by figures on the zoning map, shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on said map. 
                  D.  Where figures are shown on the zoning map between a street and a district boundary, they shall indicate that the district boundary runs parallel to the street line at a distance therefrom equivalent to the number of feet so indicated, unless specified. Where scaled distances do not agree with such figures, the figures shall control. 
                  Section 303. - Federal and state owned property. 
                  Wherever federal or state owned property is included in one or more zoning districts, it shall be subject to the provisions of this ordinance only insofar as permitted by the constitution and laws of the United States of America and of the State of Georgia.

                  D.  Provision shall be made for safe and efficient ingress and egress to and from public highways serving the district without congestion to or interference with normal traffic flow. 
                  E.  Access barrier. Each lot or center with its building, other structures, and parking and loading areas, shall be physically separated from each adjoining highway or street by a curb or other suitable barrier including a landscaped buffer strip against unchanneled motor vehicle ingress or egress. Such a barrier shall be located at the edge of the street line unless suitable curbs and gutters are provided within the highway or street right-of-way. Except for the accessways permitted below, such barrier shall be continuous for the entire length of any lot line adjoining a street or highway. 
                  F.  Accessways. All permanent points of vehicular access to and from the public streets shall be located not less than 100 feet from the intersection of any public street lines; except that access may be permitted to a minor or secondary street within not less than 100 feet of its intersection with the major highway. 
                  All accessways shall comply with the following requirements:

                  2.  Spacing of accessways. In HOC districts no part of any accessway shall be nearer than 20 feet to any other accessway on the same lot, nor shall any part of an accessway be nearer than ten feet to any side or rear property line at its intersection with a street line. Insofar as practicable, the use of common accessways by two or more permitted uses shall be encouraged in order to reduce the number and closeness of access points along highways. 
                  3.  Marginal access drives (or service streets). A 20-foot wide marginal access drive may be permitted so as to reduce the number of accessways and improve vehicular circulation within the HOC district. This drive would be located adjacent to the landscaped buffer area and extend parallel to the street line of the major highway. Access to this facility from the parking areas of the commercial establishments shall be so located as to facilitate traffic movement between the major highway (or intersecting road) the marginal access drive, and the parking area. 
                  Prior to granting of approval of a development plan, the city shall ensure that adequate legal provisions are considered concerning the use, ownership, and responsibility of the marginal access drives. 
                  G.  Lighting facilities shall be arranged in a manner which will protect the highway and neighboring properties from unreasonable direct glare or hazardous interference of any kind.

                  Section 1500. - Preamble. 
                  The mayor and city council of Statesboro have determined that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city that a comprehensive and balanced system of control and regulation be enacted as to the placement, maintenance and removal of signs within the limits of the city, said determination having been derived from, but not limited to the following concerns: 
                  A.  The safe and efficient flow of motor vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian traffic through the city which may otherwise be impeded by the indiscriminate proliferation of signage erected to attract the attention of the traveling public, and which if left unregulated, may result in hazards to travelers through the erection of increased numbers of larger, brighter or more distracting signs by owners attempting to convey competing messages; 
                  B.  The protection of property values, both public and private, by assuring the compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses while balancing the community's variant interests of enhancing the commercial and economic atmosphere of the city with the desire to maintain a tranquil aesthetic environment that eliminates visual clutter and blight through the management of hardscape features, including signage; 
                  C.  The interference with the ability of property owners to enjoy or use their property without undue visual obstruction, distraction or hazard; 
                  D.  The preservation and protection of properties and areas having historic, recreational, educational, cultural, religious values and environments, and prominent community gateways and major thoroughfares which, through orderly design and maintenance of the built environment—Including signage, provide for community pride and exhibit clear community expectations that promote investment through a predictable development pattern; 
                  E.  The elimination of potential hazards arising during times of inclement weather or other natural disaster; 
                  F.  The provision of some signage that has the targeted purpose of promoting public safety, but for which the identification of such signage by description is difficult without referring to its incidental function; such as, address numerals or subdivision or major development entrance signage; which, is a tool for enabling the traveling public and emergency personnel to locate point of ingress and egress during visitation or emergency call response. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this ordinance, the provisions of this ordinance are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners; 
                  G.  The control of the proliferation and placement of signs in an indiscriminate manner so as to pose a threat to the aesthetic and environmental values and qualities of life within the City of Statesboro; 
                  H.  Increasingly vibrant and distracting signs, including those incorporating LED and similar technology cause unique and substantial hazards to traffic caused by a higher level of distractability, are inconsistent with the standards established for major community thoroughfares and gateways, and demand greater diligence and resources in enforcing proper use and display than those signs not incorporating such technology; and, 
                  I.  In addition to the other concerns stated within this section, specific districts, thoroughfares and gateways throughout the community, due to traffic volumes, population density, proximity to major community facilities, or other similar factors, may — absent the provision of reasonable land management regulations — be more susceptible to the proliferation of signage, banners and other similar displays than other parts of the city; but, have otherwise been determined by the community to be of significant importance in maintaining an orderly, moderated and consistent development pattern and a community character free of visual clutter including, but not limited to the following: 
                  i.  Veterans Memorial Highway. The city's principal by-way alternatively serves as a community greenway, providing for areas of natural landscape; and, where flanked by development, a soft transition between the natural and built environment. With few direct vehicular access points to adjacent property, abutting properties will remain rural or develop in a residential manner. Signs on this thoroughfare must remain limited in number and scale to avoid the inadvertent placement of signage in proximity to the city's neighborhoods and greenspaces that would not otherwise be permitted in residential areas and on residential streets. The allowance for unregulated signage will further reduce the highway's function as a community parkway, contradicting the community interest of providing for an orderly visual environment. 
                  ii.  Urban Core. The city of Statesboro's historic downtown and central business district, and surrounding properties extending north to Parrish Street and south to Georgia Southern University are located in the Urban Core Character Area as identified in the Statesboro Comprehensive Plan (2009-2019). The Urban Core Character Area will redevelop with an urban characteristic that emphasizes buildings, streets, and streetscape transition between these elements, in a manner that is human in scale and focuses on pedestrian orientation — effectively serving as an extension of the traditional downtown development pattern. Signage in the Urban Core must be of a size and scale that works in harmony with preferred building patterns that promote pedestrian activity. Large, bright and signage of excessive size contradicts the desired development pattern of the urban core and makes mixed-use urban development patterns more difficult to implement over time by conflicting with limited development space and resulting in open expanses of property that are undesirable or unsafe for pedestrian activity. 
                  iii.  South Main Street and Fair Road (Urban Core Character Area to Veteran's Memorial Parkway). These thoroughfares serve as principal gateways into the city of Statesboro, and provide direct access to facilities of regional and statewide importance including Georgia Southern University and East Georgia Regional Medical Center. Signs shall be encouraged that are creative and well-designed and that contribute in a positive way to the city's visual environment, express local character, and help develop a distinctive image for the city. Signs permitted to be placed in a haphazard manner and at a large scale, compete with adjacent buildings and properties for attention and lessen the importance of community institutions. Excessive amounts of signage will damage the community's "sense of place" and subsequently place the city of Statesboro at a disadvantage when competing for investment with communities that regulate their built environments in a more progressive manner. 
                  iv.  East Main Street (Central Business District to Municipal Limits). The eastern gateway into downtown Statesboro provides a soft transition from rural land uses into concentrated residential areas of varying density with limited supporting commercial services and substantial community open spaces including Mill Creek Regional Park. Emphasis along this thoroughfare should be placed on mixing substantial amounts of natural and manicured landscaping that provide increased value to residential areas. Signage of excessive size and scale directly conflicts with the passiveness of surrounding architecture, natural settings, and low to moderate density residential land uses, and will devalue adjacent residential property. Signs must be of smaller scale to reflect the neighborhood atmosphere of the area, and the local nature of supporting businesses, services and public facilities.

An application for construction, creation, or installation of a new sign or for modification of an existing sign shall be accompanied by a detailed illustration of the dimensions, design, structure, and location of each sign in the format prescribed within the official application form. Each sign on the same lot shall be subject to a separate application and corresponding fee. 
                  C.  Action. Within 15 business days of the submission of an application for a sign permit, including required and accompanying materials as provided in section 1503 B. of this ordinance [article], the zoning administrator shall either: 
                  1.  Issue the permit where it is found that such sign application is complete and the proposed sign adheres to the standards of this article and other applicable requirements of city ordinances and state law; or 
                  2.  Deny the permit where the application is incomplete, contains false material statements or where the proposed sign would violate standards of this ordinance or other ordinances or state laws regulating signage. Any denial of a permit shall be in writing and shall include a specification of the section(s) of the ordinance, or applicable provision of other city ordinances or state laws with which the sign is inconsistent. The denial shall be based upon and shall cite to the specific articulated standards in this ordinance [article], or other law, and shall not be based or cited to the general concerns contained in section 1500 herein. A denied application later resubmitted in conformity with this ordinance shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, rather than on the date of original submission. A decision to deny a permit shall be in writing and shall be served on the permit applicant either by hand delivery or by first class mail to the address provided by the applicant no later than 15 business days after initial receipt of the application. 
                  D.  Inspection. The zoning administrator shall inspect the lot for which each permit for a new sign or for modification of an existing sign is issued, sixth months after issuance of such permit or at such earlier date as the owner may request. If the construction is not substantially complete at the time of inspection, the permit shall lapse and become void. If the construction is complete and in full compliance with this ordinance [article] and other applicable codes, the zoning administrator shall affix to the premises a permanent symbol identifying the sign(s) and the applicable permit by number. If the construction is substantially complete, but not in full compliance with this ordinance [article] and applicable codes, the zoning administrator shall give the owner or applicant notice of the deficiencies and shall allow an additional 30 days from the date of such inspection for the deficiencies to be corrected. If deficiencies are not corrected by such date, the permit shall lapse. If construction is then complete, a permanent symbol shall be affixed described above. 
                  E.  Appeals of permit denial. In the event of denial of an application for a permit, the applicant may appeal the decision to the mayor and city council within ten business days of the hand delivery or mailing of such denial. The applicant shall make written notice of appeal to the city manager, who shall schedule the hearing before the mayor and city council at the next council meeting occurring at least seven days after such notice is received. At the appeals hearing, the sole issues are whether the permit application is complete and free from false material statements and whether the proposed sign complies with the standards of this ordinance and other ordinances and state laws regulating the proposed sign. Where the mayor and council find the application to be complete and true and that the proposed sign would comply with all terms of governing law, the permit shall be issued. The mayor and council shall make its decision no later than 30 days after the date of hearing and a written copy of that decision, with supporting reasons shall be transmitted to the applicant in the same manner as the initial decision of the city. 
                  F.  Revocation. In the event it is determined that a permit was issued in violation of this ordinance or other ordinance or law regulating the sign at issue or where the sign has been erected in violation of such standards, the zoning administrator shall issue a written notice of revocation of the permit, stating the grounds for such revocation action. The notice of revocation shall be in the same form as notices of denial and delivered to the permit holder in the same manner as a notice of denial. Where no appeal is taken within ten business days of giving notice, the revocation shall be considered final. Within ten business days of receipt of a notice of revocation, a permit holder may appeal the notice by filing a written notice of revocation with the city manager in the same form as appeals of a notice of denial. Hearing on an appeal of revocation shall be conducted within the same time frames and the same manner as appeals of denial. 
                  G.  Variances. No variances shall be permitted from the terms of this article. Specifically, no variances under article XVIII of this ordinance [chapter] shall be applicable to the standards contained within this article. 
                  H.  Work without permit issuance. If any person, owner, authorized agent or contractor commences any work before securing permits required by this ordinance [article], fees upon application shall be doubled. Such fees shall be in addition to any other remedy resulting from enforcement of this article as provided by section 1515. 
                  I.  Multiple lots. If several lots of record which are contiguous and adjacent have been combined for a single purpose, then the lots shall be considered as a single lot in determining the size, height and use requirements as set forth by this ordinance.

The permit holder shall be responsible for maintaining the permit for every sign constructed, erected or maintained for which a permit is required by this ordinance [article]. Such permit shall be kept on the premises served by the sign and shall be exhibited promptly upon request of city officers and employees. 
                  B.  Assignment of sign permits. A current and valid sign permit shall be freely assignable to a successor as owner of the property or holder of a business license for the same premises, subject to any filing of such applications as the zoning administrator may require; no fees shall be charged for filing an assignment with the city. The assignment shall not require city approval. However, a modification of the sign by an assignee shall require a permit and payment of fee as for a new sign.

                  E.  Temporary signs and banners.

                  Section 1509. - Location, number and dimension of permitted signs. 
                  A.  Sign districts. Signs of certain types, characteristics, numbers and dimensions are permitted in specific locations, and according to standards established by this section and other applicable sections of this article. For the purposes of categorizing suitable signs by location in the city, the following sign districts are established: 
                  1.  Sign District 1 is any Residential District (R-3, R-4, R-6, R-8, R-10, R-15, R-20, R-30, and R-40). 
                  2.  Sign District 2 is CR, HOC, HI, and LI Zoning Districts on State and Federal Highway Systems, except for those specific State and Federal highway segments identified and included within Sign District 3. 
                  3.  Sign District 3 is the O zoning district in any location, and the CR, HOC, HI, and LI Zoning Districts on thoroughfares not part of the State or Federal Highway system, but otherwise including the following specific segments of the State or Federal Highway System: 
                  i.  Veterans Memorial Highway. 
                  ii.  State and Federal highway segments located in the Urban Core Character Area as identified by the Statesboro Comprehensive Plan (2009-2019), excluding the Central Business District, and as may be subsequently amended in accordance with the "Rules of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-1, 'Local Planning Requirements.'" 
                  iii.  South Main Street and Fair Road between the Urban Core Character Area and Veteran's Memorial Highway. 
                  iv.  East Main Street between the Central Business District and the Municipal Limits. 
                  4.  Sign District 4 is the Central Business District. 
                  B.  Location by sign district. Signs may be erected in those districts where the applicable sign type is allowed as identified in Table 2. 
                  Table 2. Permitted Signs by Type and Sign District 

                   
                  C.  Dimensional standards by sign district. Signs may be erected in those districts where the applicable sign type is allowed as provided within the Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 contained in this section. The following principles shall control when computing the sign area, height and other miscellaneous provisions provided in Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6: 
                  1.  Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face shall be calculated by means of the smallest shape (i.e., square, circle, rectangle) that surrounds the extreme limits of writing or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework. 
                  2.  Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The area of a sign with more than one face shall be calculated by totaling the areas of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two faces are identical and back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time, the sign shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. 
                  3.  Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be calculated as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. 
                  4.  Computation of maximum total permitted sign area for a lot. The permitted total of the area of all individual signs on a zone lot shall be computed by applying the formula from Tables 3, 4, 5 or 6, to the lot or building frontage, or wall area, for the zoning district in which the lot is located. If a lot fronts on two or more streets, it is allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage.

                  Section 1510. - Imagery and illumination by sign district. 
                  A.  In general. Signs for which a permit is required may incorporate a degree of variable imagery or illumination as provided within Table 7, the accompanying provisions of this section, and other applicable sections of this article.

                  B.  Changeable copy signs. Changeable copy signs are permitted as an integral part of any permanent signs which meet all other requirements of this ordinance [article], and further subject to the following restrictions: 
                  1.  The changeable copy portion of the sign shall not exceed 50 percent of the overall display surface area of the sign, or 20 square feet, whichever is less. Manual and electronic changeable copy fuel price digits shall not be counted in the permitted changeable copy area so long as they comply with the overall area limitations for the signs on which they are placed. 
                  2.  The total display area of any sign containing changeable copy panels shall not exceed the size limitations imposed elsewhere in this ordinance or article. 
                  3.  Only static displays shall be permitted. Changes will be limited to the instant replacement of unrelated text, incorporating no transitional sequence between messages, such as dissolves, fades scrolling or other similar actions. 
                  4.  Messages displayed on changeable copy signs shall change no more frequently than eight seconds. 
                  5.  Changeable copy signs will only be allowed as part of the original construction and erection of a sign which complies with the specifications required by this article, or as part of a significant structural alteration to an existing sign, and thus being an integral part of that sign, and in the case of an existing nonconforming sign such structural alteration will otherwise bring the sign into compliance with the other dimensional requirements of the Sign District within which it is located. Changeable copy signs which exceed the specifications contained herein and which are altered in form by the addition of structural materials to meet the requirements of this section are not permitted. 
                  C.  Illumination. Where internal or external illumination of signs is permitted within this article, no lighting arrangement shall impair the vision of the traveling public in any way. 
                  D.  Reflective surfaces. Sign faces shall not incorporate reflective surface materials which may obstruct, impair or interfere with the vision of the traveling public in any way. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-05, § 1, 6-16-09; Ord. No. 2013-07, §§ 1.A, 1.B, 6-18-13) 
                  Section 1511. - Billboards. 
                  A.  General. All signs located on sites abutting or visible from the right-of-way of roads in the state highway system shall meet all federal and state requirements necessary to obtain a permit. In the event that the provisions of this ordinance for the City of Statesboro are more restrictive than the provisions of state and federal law, then this ordinance [article] shall prevail and control. 
                  Billboards shall be permitted only in Sign District 2 as established in subsection 1509 A.2 of this ordinance [article]. 
                  B.  Size and number. No billboard (display area and attached trim) shall exceed 300 square feet in size. No more than one sign per sign structure will be allowed to face the same direction. This provision allows back-to-back and V-shaped side-by-side signs. 
                  C.  Location and orientation. Only one billboard shall be allowed per platted lot. No billboard shall be placed on any lot that contains a monument or stanchion sign. Billboards shall be oriented so that he sign face projects toward the thoroughfare along which it is permitted and located. 
                  D.  Distance from public properties and institutions. No billboard shall be erected within 500 feet of the nearest property line of any public park, public playground, public recreation area, public forest, public university or other public school, scenic area, or cemetery. 
                  E.  Radial spacing. No billboard shall be permitted to be erected within 1,000 feet of another existing billboard regardless of the jurisdiction in which the existing billboard is located. 
                  F.  Setback and height. [An] outdoor advertising sign (display area) shall be set back no less than 20 feet, and no greater than 100 feet from the right-of-way line of any street or highway. The total height of the outdoor advertising sign(s) shall not be greater than 25 feet when measured from the grade level grade of the sign site. 
                  G.  Extrusions prohibited. Extrusions beyond the face of the sign, excluding aprons, are prohibited. 
                  H.  Illumination. All illuminated signs shall use base or top mounted lights and shall be activated by photoelectric cells. Additional lighting including but not limited to neon, animation and running lights are prohibited. No lighting shall impair the vision of the traveling public in any way. 
                  I.  Historic area locations prohibited. No outdoor advertising sign shall be placed in or obstruct the view of an area of designated historical site in the city. No billboard shall be placed within 500 feet of a designated historical district or site. Historical districts and sites shall be listed in the state or national register. 
                  J.  Expiration of approval. The approval for the placement of a billboard shall be void if the applicant fails to obtain a building permit within six months from the date of authorization thereof or to complete erection of the billboard within six months of obtaining a permit.

                  Section 1512. - Design, construction, and maintenance. 
                  A.  All signs shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Standard Building Code and National Electrical Code as adopted by the city. All signs must be designed to withstand winds of 105 miles per hour. 
                  B.  With the exception of temporary, special event or spectacular and window signs, all signs shall be constructed of permanent materials and permanently attached to the ground, building or any other structure. 
                  C.  All signs shall be maintained in good structural condition, aesthetically pleasing in appearance, and in compliance with all building and electrical codes. The following are some examples of deficiencies which reflect a lack of care: rust spots; loose boards; paint or lettering faded; paint chipping or peeling; lights not working or burned out; colored or transparent panels used with backlighting which are missing, broken, faded or damaged; inspection plates loose or missing; or overall sign appearance not consistent with the other signs in the general area.

                  Section 1513. - Existing and nonconforming signs. 
                  A.  Existing signs. Signs existing and in place at the time of enactment of this ordinance [article] which were legal at the time of erection but are not in compliance with the requirements hereof are nonconforming signs. Nonconforming signs existing as of June 16, 2009, shall be exempt from fees or the requirement to apply for a permit. However, the use of any temporary or portable sign existing at the time of passage of this ordinance shall be continued or considered a nonconforming sign and not subject to the provisions of this section only for 90 days, but shall not be continued or considered a nonconforming use thereafter and shall be removed. The bolting down of signs by their construction and nature designed to be temporary shall not henceforth qualify a sign for consideration as a nonconforming sign. Any person who had a portable changeable copy sign in place on their premises at the time of enactment of this sign ordinance and which must be removed within 90 days of enactment of this ordinance, shall have a grace period of 18 months from enactment of this ordinance in which they may add a changeable copy sign as part of a significant structural alteration to an existing sign without the existing sign losing its status as a nonconforming and existing sign in the event the addition causes the existing sign to exceed the height and size restrictions of this ordinance. 
                  B.  Nonconforming signs. Nonconforming signs once removed may not be replaced by signs that do not comply with the requirements of this ordinance [article]. Nonconforming signs may not be renovated in such a manner that significantly alters the nature of the sign and said sign remains in noncompliance with the requirements of this ordinance [article] following renovation. The replacement of panels which do not alter the structural composition of the signs shall not be considered a renovation that results in loss of nonconforming status, except that nothing within this provision shall infer that panel replacement may allow for an increase, change or alteration in the nonconforming characteristics of a sign, or allow for the use of replacement panels that are otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  C.  Maintenance of nonconforming signs. Nonconforming signs shall be kept in the same manner of maintenance and repair as specified for conforming signs in section 1512 of this ordinance [article]. 
                  D.  Change of status of owner. Replacements of or changes to a sign resulting from a change in status of the owner or lessee of premises served by a nonconforming sign subsequent to the adoption of this section shall negate the protections afforded nonconforming status and the sign shall be removed or brought into compliance with the provisions of this ordinance [article], with the following exception: The replacement of panels or other alterations to a nonconforming sign which reflect a change in the message but which do not involve a change in the basic structure or major structural components of the sign, nor which increase the height and/or square footage of the sign, shall not result in loss of status as a nonconforming use. 
                  E.  Unsafe nonconforming sign. Any nonconforming sign determined to be unsafe by the zoning administrator shall be removed or rendered safe and brought into compliance with the provisions of this ordinance [article]. 
                  F.  Damaged nonconforming sign. Signs becoming damaged or dilapidated as a result of the passage of time may not be repaired and shall be removed. Nonconforming signs damaged by Act of God may be repaired by the owner of the sign. To the extent such a sign can be brought into conformance with the ordinance at the time of repair, the owner will be required to do so. If a nonconforming sign damaged or destroyed by Act of God cannot be brought into compliance, then the owner may be allowed to repair the nonconforming sign, but no such repair shall be considered to extend the natural life of the sign prior to its becoming damaged by the Act of God. 
                  G.  Conforming and nonconforming signs. No conforming sign or advertising device shall be erected on the business premises of a sign permit holder or applicant if the permit holder or applicant maintains an existing nonconforming sign on the business premises of the sign permit holder or applicant until the nonconforming sign has been removed. 
                  H.  Incentives for nonconforming signs. In the event a nonconforming sign is removed and replaced with a sign in conformance with this ordinance [article], the owner of the property on which the sign is placed shall be allowed a waiver of all charges due under this ordinance [article] up to the amount equal to the costs of removal of the nonconforming sign and erection of a conforming sign. In order to qualify for the waiver, proof of costs must be presented to the zoning administrator and shall not exceed the fair market value of such costs, as determined by inquiry of the zoning administrator.

                  Section 1514. - Violations. 
                  Any of the following shall be a violation of this ordinance [article] and shall be subject to the enforcement remedies and penalties provided by this ordinance [article], by the zoning ordinance [this appendix], and by state law: 
                  A.  To install, create, erect, or maintain any sign in a way that is inconsistent with any plan or permit governing such sign or the lot on which the sign is located; 
                  B.  To install, create, erect, or maintain any sign requiring a permit without such a permit; 
                  C.  To fail to remove any sign that is installed, created, erected, or maintained in violation of this ordinance [article], for which the sign permit has lapsed; 
                  D.  To continue any such violation. Each such day of a continued violation shall be considered a separate violation when applying the penalty portions of this ordinance [article]; 
                  E.  Each sign installed, created, erected, or maintained in violation of this ordinance [article] shall be considered a separate violation when applying the penalty portions of this ordinance [article]; 
                  F.  It shall further be a violation of this ordinance [article] to paste, print, nail, tack or otherwise fasten any card, banner, handbill, sign, poster or advertisement or notice of any kind, or cause the same to be done, on any private property without the consent of the owner of such property. No person shall construct, erect, operate, use or maintain any sign without the written permission of the owner or other person in lawful possession or control of the property on which such structure or sign is located. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-05, § 1, 6-16-09) 
                  Section 1515. - Enforcement and remedies. 
                  All enforcement and remedies contained in article XIX of the zoning ordinance [this appendix] apply to this section. In addition, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  A.  The zoning administrator shall cause to be removed any sign that endangers the public safety, such as an abandoned, dangerous, or materially electrical or structurally defective sign or a sign for which no permit has been issued when required or which is otherwise in violation of this ordinance [article]. The zoning administrator shall prepare a written citation that shall describe the sign and specify the violation involved and that shall state that if the sign is not removed or the violation is not corrected within ten days or such further time as is reasonable under the circumstances in the determination of the zoning administrator, the sign shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section; provided that, where a sign poses an imminent danger to the life or health of members of the public, the zoning administrator may cause the sign to be secured or removed without first affecting such notice and shall provide notice after the fact to the owner of the property and owner of the sign. 
                  B.  All notices by the zoning administrator shall be personally served or sent by first class mail. Any time periods provided in this section shall be deemed to commence on the date received, if hand delivered, or three days after the date mailed. 
                  C.  The notice shall be mailed to the owner of the property on which the sign is located, the owner of the sign, and the occupant of the property. If any such persons are unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be mailed to such persons' last known address, if any, and posted on the sign or on the premises. 
                  D.  Any person having an interest in the sign or the property may appeal the determination of the zoning administrator ordering removal or compliance by filing written notice of appeal with the city administrator within ten business days after receipt of the notice. Appeals will be provided in the manner set forth in section 1503 F. of this ordinance [article]. 
                  E.  Any sign removed by the zoning administrator pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The cost of removal of the sign by the city shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recoverable in the same manner as city property taxes. The cost of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sign's removal. In the event it is practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the removal, the city administrator may do so at public or private sale at the best price obtainable; the city shall keep an account of the proceeds. Such proceeds, if any, shall be used to offset the costs of removal to be charged to the sign owner or property owner. Any proceeds in excess of the cost of removal shall be returned to the sign owner, if known, or, if unknown, shall be deposited in the city treasury and maintained for a period of three years. At the end of the three years, all unclaimed proceeds shall become property of the city. Where the proceeds derived from such sale are less than the cost of the removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located, such lien to be collectible in the same manner as city property taxes. 
                  F.  Any sign erected in violation of this ordinance [article] may be removed from public property or right-of-way by duly authorized employees of the city and the responsible party may be cited for such violation.

                  Section 1601. - Design requirements for multifamily, commercial, and industrial parking lots. 
                  The following rules shall be observed: 
                  A.  With the exception of drive aisles, a minimum setback of three feet is required of all parking facilities. Measurements will be made from the closest property line to the curb or curb bumper. 
                  B.  The following minimum design standards (based on the Parking Consultants Council and the National Parking Association's Recommended Guidelines for Parking Geometrics) shall be observed in laying out offstreet parking facilities: 

                   

                  C.  Stacking. For any use with a drive-up facility that requires vehicles to wait for merchandise or service, such as a restaurant, a vehicular stacking area shall be provided with sufficient area for a minimum of four vehicles to park in line behind one vehicle stopped at the facility's first stopping point. The stacking area shall be provided entirely on the property and shall be designed so it does not prohibit vehicles from entering or exiting parking spaces or the lot itself and it shall not be within a required drive aisle. 
                  D.  Islands. Parking facilities that are part of a commercial development requiring 50 or more spaces shall include landscape islands at the rate of one landscape for every 50 required spaces.

                  2.  Joint parking. Parking spaces that are proposed to be shared among two or more uses must be clearly available to all uses collectively and not appear to be serving a particular use, either through signage dedicating the spaces or through design techniques that would tend to orient use of the spaces to a particular business or building.

Joint or shared parking arrangements involving two or more parcels must be committed to writing in an instrument acceptable to the director of planning/community development and approved by the owners of each of the affected properties or uses.

                  1.  All parking lots and loading areas shall be paved with concrete, asphalt, concrete/brick pavers or similar "all weather" surface materials approved by the city engineer.

                  3.  An administrative variance may be granted from the paving, marking, and or curb/gutter requirements of this provision if negative impact to the environment would occur, or, if the provision of alternative surface materials, curbing, or access control would be more compatible with the character of the area or more suitable for environmental, drainage, storm water, or other relevant considerations. Administrative relief may be granted from this provision upon a showing of facts substantiating the requested relief, rather than upon a showing of hardship. 
                  G.  Proper grading to eliminate sheet flow of drainage water onto sidewalks, public rights-of-way, and abutting property shall be designed and constructed. Provisions may be necessary for the on-site collection and storage of drainage water. The effects of sheet flow may be mitigated by the use of pervious surfaces for parking facilities.

                  I.  Clear and permanent markings shall be provided to define individual parking spaces, drive aisles, drive lanes, and intersections in accordance with specifications approved by the city engineer.

                  [L]J.  Parking facilities must be in conformance with the provisions of this section prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building served by the parking facilities or an occupational tax certificate for a business on the property. 
                  [M]L.  Parking facilities shall be constructed or enlarged and meet all applicable provisions of this article when a new building is constructed, an existing building is enlarged, additional dwelling units are created, or when a use is intensified by the addition of floor space, seating capacity, or change in use.

                  No rubbish, salvage materials, junk, or miscellaneous refuse shall be openly stored or kept in the open and no weeds shall be allowed to go uncut within any zones when the same may be construed to be a menace to public health and safety or to have a depressing influence upon property values in the area. 
                  Section 2205.1. - Screening of junkyards. 
                  Certain uses such as junk or salvage yard operations and other commercial and industrial operations requiring the storage of inoperative equipment or vehicles for prolonged periods of time could present unsightly views or health hazards. To preclude this from occurring, owners of such properties shall completely enclose such operations by a fence with completely obscured views of the property from adjacent sidewalks and streets, built to a height greater than that of the height of the highest piece of equipment or vehicle stored on the property provided that no fence shall be less than three feet nor more than 20 feet in height when measured from the crown of the adjacent street(s). Such fences shall be constructed of solid materials. Construction of cyclone fencing which utilizes metal inserts as screening shall be prohibited. Fencing along street frontages shall be located no closer than 90 feet from the centerline of the adjacent street. 
                  Many operations which involve the stacking of inoperative or obsolete equipment or vehicles pose a direct health hazard to the public. All such operations are subject to an annual inspection by the Bulloch County Health Department. The results of any such inspections shall be delivered to the zoning enforcement officer for review. If a business fails to pass such inspection it shall have 30 days to comply or it shall cease operations until such time that compliance is effected. 
                  All uses listed herein shall be operated in strict conformance with the following regulations: 
                  1.  The minimum land area for a junk salvage yard shall be five acres; provided further that the mayor and city council upon recommendation of the zoning administrator may authorize a licensed automobile salvage yard to maintain less area if all other provisions of the zoning ordinance are observed and a smaller area would best serve the public interest; provided however, that in no case will an automobile yard contain less than one acre. 
                  2.  No automobile salvage yard or used parts dealer shall store more than 50 automobile bodies per net storage acre. For the purpose of enforcing this ordinance a "net storage acre" is 75 percent of an acre; provided that the formula for determining maximum storage density to individual automobile salvage yards is: 
                  A × .75 × 50 (automobile bodies) 
                  A = Total contingent acreage 
                  3.  All junkyards, salvage yards, and related uses shall be located on well-drained areas; provided that no drainage channel or watercourse shall traverse storage and dismantling operation areas.

                  Section 2206. - Public utilities. 
                  The provisions of this ordinance shall not be so constructed as to limit or interfere with the installation, operation, and maintenance of public utility structures or facilities in existence at the time of passage of this ordinance, or which may hereafter be located within public easements or rights-of-way designated for such purposes. 
                  Section 2207. - Annexation-deannexation. 
                  In the event of changes in the city limits removing territory from the city, district boundaries shall be construed as moving with city limits. In the event of annexation of new areas to the city, such areas shall be considered to be in the R-40 district until otherwise classified.

                  Whenever, in the course of administration and enforcement of this ordinance, it is necessary or desirable to make any administrative decision, then, unless other standards are in this ordinance provided, the decision shall be made so that the result will not be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this ordinance. 
                  Section 2209. - Swimming pools and screen enclosures. 
                  A.  Private swimming pools. A private swimming pool shall be allowed in any residential zoning district, and on any lot used principally as a single-family, duplex or multifamily dwelling, as an accessory use only if it fully complies with the following standards: 
                  1.  The swimming pool shall be used solely for the enjoyment of the occupants of the principal use on the property or their guests. 
                  2.  The swimming pool, including any surrounding patio, decking, etc., shall be located no closer than ten feet from any property line, provided, however, that it shall not be located in any front yard. 
                  3.  The swimming pool shall not be constructed on a lot prior to the time of construction of the principal building to which it is accessory. 
                  B.  Screen enclosures. A screen enclosure constructed around and over a swimming pool shall be considered an accessory structure, whether detached or attached to the principal building. Screen enclosures which are utilized to enclose swimming pools shall not be restricted as to square footage, except that they shall be only of adequate size to envelope the pool and surrounding patio, decking, etc. Screen enclosures shall further comply with the following standards: 
                  1.  In no case shall a screened enclosure exceed 25 feet in height, or a height equivalent to the peak of the principal building on the lot, whichever is less. 
                  2.  Screen enclosures shall not be located within the front yard, and shall not be within ten feet of any property line.

                  Whenever any nonresidential use abuts a residential zoned area, or when multifamily residences are adjacent to single-family or two-family residences or districts, or a mobile home park, one of the following buffers shall be installed on the lot with the more intensive and least restrictive use along the common lot lines. 
                  1.  Natural buffer strip. A strip at least 50 feet wide, having and [an] existing natural growth equivalent to a densely planted evergreen screen. A landscape plan identifying all existing trees of six-inch caliper or greater which are to be retained inside the 50-foot natural buffer strip along with any proposed trees and shrubs must be approved by the zoning enforcement official prior to any site construction. The zoning enforcement officer may require additional planting to acquire a uniform buffer strip. 
                  2.  Landscape buffer strip. A strip at least ten feet wide, densely planted with shrubs and/or trees at least three feet high at the time of planting, of a type that will possess growth characteristics of such a nature as to produce a dense, compact evergreen planting screen capable of growing to a height of at least six feet within three years. A landscape plan identifying all plants to be incorporated in the buffer strips must be approved by the zoning administrator prior to any site construction. The zoning administrator may require additional planting to acquire a uniform buffer strip. 
                  3.  Landscape buffer wall. A buffer strip at least ten feet wide, containing an opaque wall or barrier or uniformly painted fence at least six feet in height. Buffer strip shall have five feet of landscape plantings on the exterior side of the wall and shall be planted with appropriate trees, shrubs, and groundcover as to provide a transition from the wall to both edges of the buffer strip. A landscape plan identifying the location and construction of the wall or barrier, and all plants to be incorporated in the buffer strip must be approved by the zoning administrator prior to any site construction. The zoning administrator may require additional planting to acquire a uniform buffer strip. 
                  This ordinance will allow any of these three buffers or a combination thereof to provide flexibility in design. 
                  In addition to the requirements of this section, the requirements at [of] article XI section 1104(H) shall apply in highway oriented commercial districts.

                  (Ord. of 12-3-96, § III; Amd. of 12-4-01(3), § 10; Ord. No. 2006-8, § 1, 6-6-06) 
                  Section 2604. - General requirements. 
                  The requirements set forth in this Section shall govern the location and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennae, governed by this ordinance [article]. 
                  A.  Building codes: safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of communication towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communication towers at least once every three years to ensure structural integrity.

                  B.  Regulatory compliance. 
                  1.  All towers and antennae must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennae. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the communications towers and antennae governed by this ordinance [article] shall bring such communications towers and antennae into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. 
                  2.  Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communication tower is in compliance with all federal requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  C.  Security. Communication towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, the Director of the Governing Body may waive such requirements for alternative tower structures. 
                  D.  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the Director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  E.  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower. 
                  F.  Visual impact. 
                  1.  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  2.  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and build environment. 
                  3.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  4.  Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design. 
                  5.  Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower. 
                  G.  Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows: 
                  1.  For towers 150 feet tall or less, a buffer area no less than six feet wide shall commence at the property line. 
                  2.  For towers more than 150 feet tall, a buffer area not less than ten feet wide shall be provided at the property line. 
                  3.  The buffer zone is to consist of materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in height within two years of planting. 
                  4.  Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 20 feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff/maintenance. 
                  5.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  6.  In lieu of these standards, the Director may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions above, except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries, and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the Director. 
                  H.  Maintenance impacts and parking requirements. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector and local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street. A minimum of two parking spaces shall be provided on each site; an additional parking space for each two employees shall be provided at facilities which require on-site personnel. 
                  I.  Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
                  1.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicles storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made. 
                  2.  Towers may be located on sites containing another principals [principal] use in the same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, setback, separation and general requirements of this ordinance [article] are met, towers may occupy a parcel meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. The minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be for a monopole or lattice tower the greater of 20 percent of the tower height or 25 feet and for a guy tower the greater of 100 percent breakpoint or 25 feet. This separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site. 
                  3.  Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals. 
                  J.  Tower lot size, setbacks and separation. 
                  1.  The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to: 
                  a.  Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as required in Section IV [2604] (F) and (G); 
                  b.  Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property; 
                  c.  Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in Section IV [2604]. 
                  2.  A site is presumed to be of sufficient size when it: 
                  a.  Meets the requirements of the above subsection (1)[1.]; 
                  b.  Provides a setback equal to two times the height of the tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in Section IV [2604]; 
                  c.  Provides a setback equal to or exceeding the rear yard setback required for the adjoining property where the adjoining property is not in a residential district nor a public property or a public street. 
                  3.  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structure[s] may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
                  4.  For a guyed structure, the site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide a setback equal to at least the height of the tower from a guy anchor to any property line abutting a residential district, public property or public street in addition to the size required to comply with subsection (2)[2.] above. Such setback shall be adequate to provide a vegetative, topographic or other buffer sufficient to obscure view to the anchor from such adjoining properties. 
                  5.  All structures and uses associated with the transmission use other than the transmission tower shall be located to meet the setbacks required in the zoning district where the tower is to be located. To encourage and accommodate shared use of a tower, the Director may waive or reduce setback requirements by up to 25 percent to accommodate the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment at a tower site. 
                  6.  No free-standing communication tower shall be allowed within a 5,000 foot radius of an existing tower within a residential area. 
                  7.  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard of a residential district. 
                  8.  All free-standing towers constructed after December 3, 1996 shall conform to the following minimum tower separation requirements: 

                   
                  Towers and antennae mounted on rooftops or alternative tower structures shall be exempt from these minimum separation distances. 
                  K.  Be it ordained that the passage of this ordinance [article] also includes the adoption of Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and that all placement of towers and antenna must be approved by the FAA before a building permit or placement is allowed. This approval is generally granted by the completion of form FAA Form 7460-1, or its equivalent.

                  Section 2605. - Shared use. 
                  All new towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum number of additional users technically practicable. 
                  A.  Once a new tower is approved, additional antennae and accompanying accessory uses may be added to it in accordance with the approved share plan if the Director finds that the standards of this ordinance [article] are met. 
                  OR 
                  To encourage shared use of towers, no building permit or special use permit shall be required for the addition of antenna(e) to an existing tower so long as the height of the tower or structure on which the antenna is placed is not increased and the requirements of Sections III.B. and IV [2603B. and 2604] are met. 
                  B.  If a new tower is approved, the owner shall be required as conditions of approval, to: 
                  1.  Record the letter of intent required by Section VI.D. [2606D.] in Miscellaneous Deed Records of the Office of the County Clerk of Superior Court where the tower site is located; 
                  2.  Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information from a potential shared use applicant; 
                  3.  Negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties; and 
                  4.  Allow shared use where the third party seeking such agrees in writing to pay reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all charges necessary to modify the tower and transmitters to accommodate shared use, but not total tower reconstruction, and to observe whatever technical requirements are necessary to allow shared use without creating interference. 
                  C.  Willful, knowing failure of an owner whose tower was approved after the effective date of this ordinance [article], to comply with the requirement of [subsections] (1)[1.] through (4)[4.] above shall be grounds for withholding approval of any application by such owner for a building permit or special use permit for any tower or antenna. 
                  D.  Such conditions shall run with the land and be binding on subsequent purchasers of the tower site.

                  Section 2606. - Conditional zoning. 
                  A.  A request for a conditional zoning shall be initiated by application to the Director and handled in accordance with the conditional zoning provision of Section 2401 of the Municipal Code [this appendix]. The Statesboro City Council may grant a Conditional Zoning under this section provided it shall have determined that all of the General Requirements of Section IV [2604] have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties. 
                  B.  In granting a Conditional Zoning, the Statesboro City Council may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties.

                  Section 2607. - Application procedures. 
                  Application for a building permit for any communication tower or use of an alternative tower structure shall be made to the Director. An application will not be considered until it is complete. A complete application must contain the following: 
                  A.  Inventory of Existing Sites. An inventory of the applicant's existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The Director may share information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this ordinance [article] or other organizations seeking to locate antennae within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that the Director is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
                  B.  Site plan or plans to scale specifying the location of tower(s), guy anchors (if any), transmission building and/or other accessory uses, access, parking, fences, landscaped areas, and adjacent land uses. 
                  C.  Landscape plan to scale indicating size, spacing and type of plantings required in Section IV.G. [2604G.]. 
                  D.  Utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power lines impacting the proposed tower site. 
                  E.  An environment impact statement fully describing the effect that the proposed tower and/or antenna will not have on the environment and surrounding area including the radiological impact on human health, impacts on adjacent residential structures and districts, impacts on structures and sites of historic significance and impacts on streetscapes. 
                  F.  A certified statement prepared by an engineer licensed to practice in Georgia that the construction of the tower, including reception and transmission functions, will not interfere with the usual and customary transmission or reception of radio, television, etc., service enjoyed [by] adjacent properties. 
                  G.  A description of anticipated maintenance needs, including frequency of service, personnel needs, equipment needs, and traffic, noise or safety impacts of such maintenance. 
                  H.  Report from a professional structural engineer licensed in the State of Georgia, documenting the following: 
                  1.  Tower height and design, including technical, engineering, economic, and other pertinent factors governing selection of the proposed design. A cross-section of the tower structure shall be included. 
                  2.  Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including number and types of antennae which can be accommodated. 
                  3.  Evidence of structural integrity of the tower structure. 
                  4.  Failure characteristics of the tower and demonstration that site and setbacks are of adequate size to contain debris. 
                  I.  Written statements from the FAA, FCC and any appropriate state review authority stating that the proposed tower complies with regulations administered by that agency or that the tower is exempt from those regulations. 
                  J.  Letter of intent to lease excess space on the tower structure and to lease additional excess land on the tower site when the shared use potential of the tower is absorbed, if structurally and technically possible. 
                  K.  A reasonable pro rata charge may be made for shared use, consistent with an appropriate sharing of construction, financing and maintenance costs. Fees may also be charged for any structural or RF changes necessitated by such shared use. Such sharing shall be a condition of [if] approval is granted. 
                  1.  The applicant shall describe what range of charges are reasonably expected to be assessed against shared users. 
                  2.  The applicant shall base charges on generally accepted accounting principles and shall explain the elements included in the charge. 
                  L.  The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number and types of antennae. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The Director shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means. 
                  M.  Evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna. 
                  N.  Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or planned towers can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna/transmitter as described below: 
                  1.  The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the applicant. A list shall be provided of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, and the form and content of such contact. 
                  2.  Such contact shall be made in a timely manner; that is, sufficiently before the filing of an application for a building or Conditional Zoning to include a response into the application when filed. 
                  a.  Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, where an existing or planned tower is known to have capacity for additional antennae of the sort proposed, based on the decision regarding such tower, that application for a new tower shall not be complete until the owner of the existing or planned tower responds. Such response is to be required as a condition of approval. 
                  b.  The Director shall maintain and provide, on request, records of responses from each tower. 
                  c.  Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower as described below, the owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennae of the sort proposed. 
                  3.  The applicant shall request the following information from each tower contacted: 
                  a.  Identification of the site by location, tax lot number, existing uses, and tower height. 
                  b.  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring structural changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length, weight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna. 
                  c.  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be required. 
                  d.  If structurally able, would shared use by such existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the proposed tower, if at all. 
                  e.  If shared use is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower would charge for such shared use. 
                  4.  Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. The Director and the Governing Body may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee and costs are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. 
                  O.  Any other information which may be requested by the Director to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed tower and/or antenna.

                  Section 2609. - Removal of antennae and towers. 
                  All towers and antennae shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such towers. If upon inspection by the Director such tower is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owners shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance. In the event such tower or antenna is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the City may provide notice to the owners requiring the tower or antenna to be removed. In the event such tower or antenna is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the City may remove such tower or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the City in taking action shall not in any way waive the City's right to take action. The City may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that communication towers and antenna not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The City may seek to have the tower or antenna removed regardless of the owners' or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.

                  Section 2610. - Abandoned towers. 
                  [A.]  Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of the tower. The owner of an abandoned antenna or tower and the owner of the property where the tower is located shall be under a duty to remove such a tower or antenna. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the City notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the City may removed [remove] such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The City may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned communication towers and antenna are removed. Delay by the City in taking action shall not in any way waive the City's right to take action. The City may seek to have the communication tower or antenna removed regardless of the owners' or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  B.  If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this ordinance [article] as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna.

                  ARTICLE XXX. - DESIGN STANDARDS: DOWNTOWN DISTRICT 

                  Section 3000. - Declaration of legislative intent. 
                  It is hereby declared to be the intent of this article to establish design and development standards for the Downtown District, herein after called the "district." The purpose of this article is to foster and strengthen economic vitality in the city's district while respecting and enhancing the special character of the existing development in the area. 
                  The district is a compact assembly of storefront buildings, short walkable blocks, mixed uses, pedestrian amenities, and consolidated on- and off-street parking as well as single family residences, medium density residential developments, and an assortment of residences turned boutique commercial uses. 
                  The district is especially vulnerable to intrusion from incompatible uses and physical development practices. The district is so important and significant to the city, that it justifies a special set of regulations designed to protect and enhance its character in light of new development. The potential to impact existing development is much less in other areas of the community than in the downtown core area, and hence the regulations outside the district area do not merit the same protection. 
                  The purpose of this article is to establish requirements for building and site design for new developments and for the significant modification of existing developments within the district. This article is intended to protect the existing character of the downtown and encourage orderly development in accordance with the comprehensive plan for the City of Statesboro and the Downtown Statesboro Master Plan. 
                  The following principles serve as the foundation for the article: 
                  (a)  Efficient use of land and services. 
                  (b)  A mix of land uses which strengthen opportunities for economic vitality and support pedestrian activity as well as housing opportunities. 
                  (c)  Provide for community gathering places and pedestrian/visitor amenities. 
                  (d)  Maintain and expand a distinct storefront character for commercial properties associated with the district, specifically two- to four-story tall buildings, rectangular in mass with traditional design features. 
                  (e)  Provide transitions to adjacent neighborhoods and commercial areas. 
                  (f)  Maintain and enhance the area's character through design standards. 
                  (g)  Protect the character of existing residential neighborhoods within the district; and 
                  (h)  Promote compatibility between residential and nonresidential adjacent and nearby uses.

                  B.  Any alteration, change, or modification to any structure or site within the District which exceeds 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure or site as determined by the Bulloch County Tax Assessor is subject to the requirements of this article. 
                  C.  This article shall not apply to routine maintenance, and repair of a structure or site. However; changes to exterior colors shall comply with this article. 
                  D.  Outdoor storage or equipment, materials, or inventory is not permitted except during construction.

                  Section 3003. - Historic buildings or property. 
                  A.  A historic district is a geographically definable area, which possesses a significant concentration, continuity or linkage of buildings, sites, structures or objects aesthetically united by plan, physical development or past events. Districts may also include geographically separated individual elements linked by history or association. A historic district will further mean an area designated by the city council pursuant to the criteria set forth in section 3003 of this article. 
                  B.  "Building" may be used to refer to a historically and functionally related unit, such as a courthouse, jail, house or barn. Parts of buildings, such as interiors, facades, or wings, are not eligible independent of the rest of the existing building. The whole building must be considered, and its significant features must be identified. If a building has lost any of its basic structural elements, it is usually considered a "ruin" and is categorized as a site. 
                  C.  A historic property is a structure, site, object, or work of art, including the adjacent area necessary for the proper appreciation or use thereof. 
                  D.  Historic buildings, historic properties and historic districts are deemed worthy of preservation by reason of their value to the City of Statesboro, Bulloch County, the State of Georgia, or the region for one or more of the following reasons as determined by the city council: 
                  a.  It is an outstanding example of a structure representative of its era; 
                  b.  It is one of the few remaining examples of a past architectural style; 
                  c.  It is a place or structure associated with an event or person of historic or cultural significance to the City of Statesboro, Bulloch County, State of Georgia, or the region; 
                  d.  It is a site of natural or aesthetic interest that is continuing to contribute to the cultural or historical development and heritage of the City of Statesboro, Bulloch County, the State of Georgia or the region; 
                  e.  It is within an existing historic district or is listed with the National Registry of Historic Places; or 
                  f.  It is more than 50 years old. 
                  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction on historic buildings or historic properties shall not destroy the historic character of the property or the historic materials associated with the property. Any new work shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historical integrity of the property and its environment. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
                  Historic buildings, historic properties and buildings and properties determined eligible for national registry shall not be demolished without a finding of necessity by the city council, with the exception of non-historic, non-contributing buildings or properties within the geographical confines of a historic district. The finding of necessity is based on a finding of major structural damage in which the walls, floors, roof, windows or structural elements are damaged 35 percent or more.

                  7.  The mural's theme should be historical in nature to the City of Statesboro and respect the greater context of the community. 
                  8.  The mural's colors and design shall comply with these design standards and the requirements thereof. 
                  9.  Murals may be placed on commercial walls, structures, or fences only.

                  ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL 

                  Section 2.1. - Short title, jurisdiction and application. 
                  A.  Municipalities play a vital role in regulating land use within their jurisdictions. Land use is primarily regulated by use of a zoning ordinance and a subdivision regulations ordinance. The zoning ordinance is used to determine the specific uses that can be made of a parcel of land, minimum lot sizes, density per acre, maximum heights of buildings, the use of accessory buildings, the setbacks a building must be from the front, side, and rear property lines, the amount of off-street parking required to accommodate the intended use, signage, fencing and buffering requirements between parcels, regulation of noise, vibration and odors traveling off-site, regulation of solid waste collection systems, and similar matters. 
                  The subdivision regulations ordinance is used to determine the city's standards for new developments within its jurisdiction. Subdivision regulations set out the definition of a subdivision or re-subdivision of property into more than one tract of land, and require the recording of a detailed plat after approval by the city showing the relationship of the proposed development's lots, road system, water system, sewer system, gas system, electric system, cable television system, telecommunications system, stormwater drainage and detention system, and street lighting system to the existing systems. Also included are the minimum standards for extension of these systems that the city will accept as adequate. This includes the size of various pipes, valves, hydrants, road widths, curb and gutter, culverts, and similar standards. This assures our citizens of two primary purposes: that the systems, especially the street system, have been logically extended and connected back to the existing system using sound urban planning techniques, and that the infrastructure that is installed complies with the city's standards. 
                  The city has previously adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance, and the mayor and city council have recognized the need to adopt a comprehensive subdivision ordinance so that both primary tools for land use regulation would be in place. The Georgia Constitution at Article 9, Section 2, Paragraph 4 authorizes each city and county to adopt plans and exercise the power of zoning. Article 3, Section 6, Paragraph 2(a)(1) and (3) of the Georgia Constitution authorizes the General Assembly to authorize by statute restrictions upon land use. Chapter 70 of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia, entitled "Coordinated and Comprehensive Planning by Counties and Municipalities" specifically authorizes and requires cities to develop comprehensive plans and procedures for implementation in accordance with Administrative Rules and Regulations adopted by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. Administrative Rule 110-3-2-.04 Minimum Local Planning Standards, at subsection (3)(c)3(iii) specifically authorizes "...A description of administrative systems, regulatory measures or land development regulations to be adopted or amended over each of the next five years. Land development regulations may include building codes, subdivision regulations, zoning ordinances, performance standards..." Finally, the City Charter issued by the general assembly at section 4-11 authorizes the mayor and city council "...to promulgate rules, regulations, and ordinances whereby the City of Statesboro, Georgia may be zoned and districted for various uses, and other or different uses prohibited therein, and to regulate the use or uses for which such zones or districts may be set apart, and to promulgate rules, regulations, and ordinances for the development of real estate." Clearly, the State of Georgia by its Constitution, general statutes, administrative rules and regulations, and passage of the Statesboro City Charter has authorized and delegated to the city the authority to implement a subdivision regulations ordinance as part of the state's legislative scheme for comprehensive and coordinated land use planning and development throughout the state. 
                  The regulations set out in this ordinance [this appendix] shall be known and may be cited as "The City of Statesboro, Georgia Subdivision Regulations". 
                  These regulations shall apply to all land located within the boundaries of the City of Statesboro and shall be applicable to all divisions of a tract or parcel of land which meet the definition of "subdivision" herein. For purposes of this ordinance [this appendix], the term "subdivision" means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, buildings, sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, legacy, or building development; includes all division of land involving a new public road or a change in existing public roads; includes resubdivision; and, where appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or area subdivided; provided, however, that the following are not included within this definition: 
                  (1)  The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are equal to the standards of the municipality. 
                  (2)  The division of land into parcels of five acres or more where no new street is involved. However, this exception shall not apply to land being developed for retail commercial purposes, such as a large shopping center or single retail establishment, or an enclosed mall or other group development which may exceed five acres in size. Such developments are considered subdivisions under this ordinance [this appendix]. 
                  This definition is identical to that set out in O.C.G.A. § 32-6-150 for use by the Georgia Department of Transportation, except for subsection (2) regarding large commercial developments of more than five acres. 
                  The public health, safety, economy, good order appearance, convenience, morals and general welfare require the harmonious, orderly and progressive development of land within the City of Statesboro. In furtherance of the general intent of the City of Statesboro Zoning Ordinance, the regulation of land subdivision by municipal governing authorities is authorized for the following purposes, among others: 
                  1.  To encourage the development of an economically sound and stable City; 
                  2.  To assure the timely provision of required streets, utilities and other facilities and services to new land developments; 
                  3.  To assure the adequate provision of safe and convenient traffic access and circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, in and through new land developments; 
                  4.  To assure the provision of needed public open spaces and building sites in new land developments through the dedication or reservation of land for recreational, educational, and other public purposes; and 
                  5.  To assure, in general, the wise and timely development of new areas, in harmony with the comprehensive plan of the City of Statesboro. 
                  Section 2.2. - Scope. 
                  1.  No person shall divide or subdivide or cause a subdivision to be made, by deed or map, of any parcel of land which is located within the boundaries of the city limits of Statesboro, except in conformity with the provisions of these regulations. 
                  2.  Any owner or developer of any tract of land situated within the City of Statesboro who subdivides the same shall cause a plat of such subdivision, with reference to known or permanent monuments, to be made and recorded in the office of the clerk of court of Bulloch County, Georgia. No such plat of subdivision shall be recorded unless and until it has been approved by the mayor and city council.

                  (Ord. of 4-1-03(2), § 1) 
                  ARTICLE 3. - SUBDIVISION PLATTING PROCEDURE AND REQUIREMENTS 

                  Section 3.1. - Procedure for plat approval. 
                  A.  Review steps. The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of three separate steps. These are: 
                  Step 1: Review of the sketch plan; 
                  Step 2: Review and approval of the preliminary plat; and 
                  Step 3: Review and approval of the final plat. 
                  Review of the sketch plan (step 1) and the preliminary plat (step 2) shall be completed prior to making any street improvement, installing utilities or making any other improvements. Review and approval of the final plat (step 3) shall be completed prior to the completion of all proposed site improvements as approved by all city departments. Approval of the final plat shall also take place prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision, unless the required improvements are guaranteed as required by section E [subsection E. below]. 
                  B.  Sketch plan review. Prior to the filing of a preliminary plan, the subdivider may submit to the city zoning administrator a simple sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. The sketch plan shall include a sketch map which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning, and enable him to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. The zoning administrator shall review and approve or approve with modifications the sketch plan within 21 days from the date it was received by the city. Pertinent comments and recommendations shall be noted on the returned sketch plan. 
                  C.  Preliminary plat and approval process. Preliminary plat is the plat that developer will use for the construction plans. Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plan shall be submitted to the zoning administrator, who will coordinate the plan review with the other city departments. The subdivision plat shall be submitted in four copies and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained under [sub]section 3.2.B. Additional copies of the plan and supplemental information may be requested. Each person or agency responsible for reviewing a copy of the preliminary plat shall indicate any desired changes or comments on the plan received and return their plan copy to the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall compile all comments by the other review officials and return the "redlined" preliminary plat to the subdivider along with all comments that must be addressed in order for the preliminary plat to be approved. The review process of the preliminary plat shall take at the most 21 days. If the preliminary plat needs no further revisions, the zoning administrator shall submit 15 revised copies of the preliminary plat for approval by the planning commission and by the city council. Upon approval by the city council, the mayor shall sign the certificate of preliminary plat, which entitles the developer to start construction. Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final or as-built subdivision plat. Approval of the preliminary plat shall constitute approval of the proposed width and alignments of streets and the dimensions and shapes of lots subject to the final approval of the city planning and the city engineering departments. Approval of any building and site construction plans shall be granted by the city engineer's office upon the submission of detailed construction drawings and specifications that meet the city ordinances for streets, drainage, utility design or any other applicable ordinances. 
                  Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat, the subdivider may start the construction of the site for the proposed subdivision. The developer shall complete all site work prior to any construction of buildings or houses. This means that all roads, drainage, and utilities have to be completed and approved by the city before houses and buildings can be built. The developer shall arrange periodic inspections of the project by the appropriate city departments during the course of construction. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 12 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require a re-submittal of the preliminary plat to the zoning administrator for approval. 
                  [D]4.  Variance procedure. Any preliminary plat that will require a variance from the city zoning ordinance in order to be approved shall be taken before the city planning commission and the city council for variance approval by the zoning administrator. Upon receiving a preliminary plat, the zoning administrator shall have the preliminary plat reviewed by the appropriate city staff for approval for all items; and, the review will include any comments regarding the item that will require a variance from the zoning code [ordinance] in order to be approved. City staff will return all comments to the zoning administrator. Any comments significant in nature will be returned to the subdivider to address prior to the zoning administrator placing the plans in the variance process. Once all comments from the appropriate city staff are addressed, the subdivider submits a variance request for those items that differ from the zoning ordinance. The zoning administrator will place the plans in the variance process following the guidelines stated under Article XVIII entitled "Zoning Board of Appeals" of the City of Statesboro Zoning Ordinance. The City of Statesboro Planning Commission will then review the subdivision plat with the applicable staff comments and recommend to the city council whether to approve or deny the variance request and the city council will consider the variance request at a formal public hearing to be scheduled by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator will note the date on which any variances were granted for the preliminary plat and the date written notification was sent to the subdivider or authorized agent. The variance process usually takes between four to six weeks to complete, once a subdivision plan is placed in the variance process. The zoning administrator shall return the approved or denied preliminary plat to the submitting developer within three working days after final decision is taken by the city council on the variance request. 
                  [E]EF.  Final plat. The final plat may be approved by the planning department in two ways. The developer has a choice to apply for approval of the final plat either when all required improvements are completed, or if he provides an assurance of completion and maintenance of improvements to the City of Statesboro. 
                  Option [No.] 1. Required improvements are completed: 
                  When all required improvements are completed, the final plat shall conform substantially to the approved preliminary plat and if there was substantial deviation from the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall prove these deviations. If desired by the developer, the final plat mayconstitute only that portion or phasing of the preliminary plat he or she is proposing to record and develop at one time. Following approval of the preliminary plat and the completion of all required improvements to city standards, the developer shall file with the zoning administrator an application for final approval. The application shall include the following: 
                  1.  A complete list of deviations, if any, from the approved preliminary plat. 
                  2.  A certified copy of all covenants and restrictions, if any, pertaining to platted subdivision. 
                  3.  A surety bond or maintenance bond for 20 percent of total improvement costs for those facilities to be dedicated and then maintained by the city. This bond insures the maintenance of required public facilities and improvements for one year after completion and approval of said facilities. 
                  4.  A minimum of four prints of the final as-built plat, including any easements and reserved strips,and a copy of an electronic drawing file compatible with AutoCad, as per the city engineering department. 
                  5.  All as-built plans showing the locations of utility lines and service taps. 
                  The planning department and the engineering department shall review and approve a final plat. The mayor and planning director shall sign the certificate of final plat approval. The subdivider then submits the final plat for recording to the Bulloch County Clerk of Court. 
                  All Final plats provided to the city must be of a size acceptable by the Bulloch County Clerk of Court for recording. For large subdivisions, the final plat may be submitted for approval progressively in different phases satisfactory to the zoning administrator. Approval of the final plat shall not be deemed to constitute or affect an acceptance by the public or the dedication of any street or other ground shown upon the plat. Until the city officially accepts the dedication of any streets, parks, or any grounds, it is the developer's responsibility to maintain such facilities. Applicants attempting to dedicate a street or any other facility shall follow the procedure listed under article 8. 
                  The owner or agent of a subdivision shall not transfer title to any lot within the subdivision without the approval and the recording of the final plat. 
                  Option No. 2. Assurance for completion of improvements: 
                  The developer can apply for approval of the final plat if required improvements are partially completed and if he provides the City of Statesboro with assurance for completion of the remaining required improvements. Under this option, the developer must complete the grading of all roads; however he can bond the base and paving of these roads. When this method is chosen, the developer shall consider the following: 
                  [F.]  Improvement and guarantee: Before the planning commission and the city council approve the final plat, all applicants shall be required to complete or provide improvement guarantees (in the form of a performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit, as provided in section 9.7) for all remaining construction of roads, utilities, drainage system and other improvements as required. 
                  1.  Improvement guarantees: The subdivider may provide improvement guarantees and deed and easement documents at the time of application for final subdivision approval. The city engineer shall approve the amount of the improvement bond which shall be sufficient to secure to the City of Statesboro the satisfactory construction, installation and dedication of the uncompleted portion of required improvements. The improvement cost estimate shall be provided by the developer and shall be prepared by a professional engineer. Assurance guarantees shall be structured to permit periodic demands for payment from the issuer in whole or in part for the entire amount of the credit. The improvement guarantee shall not be less than 100 percent of the total cost of required improvements and can be renewed for a period not to exceed one year. 
                  2.  Failure to complete improvements: In those cases where an improvement guarantee has been posted and required improvements have not been installed, the City of Statesboro shall call the improvement guarantees due and collect all funds. 
                  3.  Release or reduction of improvement guarantees: The City of Statesboro will not accept dedication of required improvements, nor release or reduce improvement guarantees, until all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed. 
                  4.  Maintenance of public improvements: The subdivider shall maintain all required improvements until acceptance of such improvements by the city. Before dedication of improvements, the applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the City of Statesboro in an amount considered adequate by the engineering department. The maintenance bond shall assure the satisfactory condition of streets and other facilities for one year after the date of their approval by the City of Statesboro. The amount of the maintenance bond shall be set at 20 percent of the total costs of required improvements of said facilities. The bond amount will be refunded after one year. 
                  Once the improvement guarantees have been posted, the developer shall apply for the approval of the final plat and follow the same criteria cited in [subsection] F.1. [above]. However, the owner or agent of a subdivision shall not transfer title to any lot within the subdivision without the approval and recording of the final plat. 
                  G.  Sketch plans and preliminary plats not required. Subdivisions which do not involve the platting, construction or opening of new streets, water, or sewer facilities, or improvement of existing streets shall be accepted by the zoning administrator in the form of a final plat. Such plat shall comply in all respects to these regulations. Sketch plans and preliminary plats are not required in such cases.

                  H.  Revisions. No change, eraser or revision shall be made on any preliminary or final plat, nor on accompanying data sheet after approval of the city has been endorsed in writing on the plat, unless authorization for such changes has been granted in writing by the city council. In the event that the subdivision plat is revised after having been initially recorded, the revised plat will be clearly marked as such and recorded with the Clerk of Court of Bulloch County. At that time, a notation shall be made on the original plat, stating that it was revised on certain date and the revised plat can be found in Plat Book_______ Page_______. Any revised plat must contain the certificate of final plat approval executed by the mayor and planning director. 
                  ARTICLE 3A. - MINOR SUBDIVISIONS 

                  Sec. 3A.1. - Procedural requirements. 
                  Minor subdivisions shall be permitted under the following procedures: 
                  A.  An accurate plat or survey meeting the requirements of the Georgia Plat Act, prepared by a registered land surveyor (bearing his seal and signature), depicting the tract and/or lots and the proposed division thereof shall be submitted to the planning department. This plat shall also include identification of adjoining property owners and any adjoining street with its rights of way width, adjacent zoning of all property abutting the proposed subdivided land, statement as to whether the property is within the 100-year flood hazard boundary area, and identification of any required (by city engineer) drainage and/or utility easements. 
                  B.  The city planning department staff shall review the proposed division of property for compliance with the minimum requirements of the zoning ordinance. In addition, the city engineering staff may be requested by planning department staff to review the site plan for utility concerns and/or drainage issues. If such standards are met, the survey shall be certified by the signature of the mayor of the city and the planning director. If the planning director determines that the requirements are not met by the proposed division of property, the plat or survey shall not be certified and the reasons shall be stated in writing. 
                  (Ord. of 4-1-03(2), § 2) 
                  ARTICLE 4. - IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED AND DESIGN STANDARDS 

                  Section 4.1. - Required improvements. 
                  The subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by the regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat. 
                  1.  Natural gas. The city will provide natural gas service to subdivisions where the proximity of the existing system makes it economically feasible. All developers should contact the natural gas department to determine whether the city can provide the service. If so, there will be no cost to the developer for this installation, and potential property owners would be eligible for all customer rebates and incentive programs of the natural gas department. Where gas lines are located within a street right-of-way, such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties. 
                  2.  Water supply. A water system shall be installed in a subdivision. Water mains, valves, and fire hydrants shall be installed according to ordinances and regulations set forth by the City of Statesboro. The water system installed shall be connected to the City of Statesboro water system through tapping into the existing lines. The property developer shall bear all the costs for the installation of this system within the actual subdivision. When the water mains to be installed are allowed to be located in the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to service each lot before the street is surfaced. Illustrations 6 and 8 [see illustrations at the end of this appendix] show water system details applicable in Statesboro. 
                  3.  Sanitary sewerage. A sanitary sewer system shall be installed in a subdivision, unless the city council specifically allows another system. Sanitary sewers shall be designed and installed according to the plans and specifications approved by the City of Statesboro, which are compatible with the city's sanitary sewer system master plan. The sewer system installed shall be connected to the City of Statesboro sewer system through a connection tying onto the existing lines. The property developer shall bear the costs for the installation of this system within the actual subdivision. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. See Illustration 7 [at the end of this appendix] for sewer tap connection. In addition, if non-metallic pipe is used, the end of this connection shall be wrapped with magnetic tape to facilitate its future location. 
                  4.  Utility easement. A 15-foot city utility easement shall be located along each side of the road right-of-way. If these 15-foot easements can not be provided, then a written appeal with justifications can be submitted for approval by the director of the water/sewer department. 
                  5.  Sewerage disposal systems. Prior to the construction of any community sewerage disposal system such as an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size, plans and specifications of such a facility shall be approved by the city engineer or his designee and the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. These type facilities would only be considered under extreme cases where it is absolutely not practical to tie onto the city's existing sewer system. Where septic tanks are used, the health department may require larger lots than required under the City of Statesboro Zoning Ordinance. Since the health department's requirements are for conformance with health standards, the prescribed lot size for such uses shall be the minimum size used in the development. 
                  6.  Curb and gutters. If used, concrete curbs or paved valley type gutters shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications of the city. Approval of the subdivider's plans by the city engineering department is required. Curb requirements shall vary depending on the functional classification of each street, (local, collector, arterial), the location and the traffic volume. Curbing may also be required as follows: 
                  a.  For storm water management; 
                  b.  To stabilize pavement edge; 
                  c.  To delineate parking areas; 
                  d.  Ten feet on each side of drainage inlets; 
                  e.  At intersections; 
                  f.  At corners; and 
                  g.  At tight radii. 
                  Curbing shall be designed to provide a ramp for bicycles and/or wheelchairs as required by state law and according to the ADA requirements. The standard curb section used shall be 20 feet in length with a construction joint, 18 inches, 24 inches, or 30 inches wide including a roll curb and gutter. Residential curb and gutter shall have a minimum gutter thickness of 6 inches and commercial curb and gutter shall have a gutter thickness of 8 inches or thicker depending on it's location, soil conditions and traffic load. All concrete used for curbs shall be prepared in accordance with applicable Georgia Department of Transportation State of Georgia Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges. Curb and gutter shall be constructed with Portland cement concrete having a compressive strength of equal or greater than 3,000 psi. 
                  Curbs and /or combination curbs and gutters shall be constructed of Class B concrete. Asphalt curb and gutter will not be acceptable within publicly maintained R/W. Curb and/or gutter shall be constructed prior to the construction of the pavement. Where drainage inlets are constructed, but curbs are not required, curbing must be provided at least ten feet on each side of the inlet, set back one foot from the extension of the pavement edge. For more information on types of curbs, refer to the Policy on Geometric Design of Highway and Street, AASHTO, 1990 edition. 
                  7.  Shoulders. 
                  a.  Shoulders are required on all roads. 
                  [b.]b.c.  Shoulders shall measure four feet in width, or as required by designing engineer, on each side for all streets and shall be located within the right-of-way as shown in Illustrations 4 and 5 [see illustrations at the end of this appendix].

                  c.  Graded shoulder shall be stabilized turf or other material acceptable to the city engineer. 
                  8.  Street grading and surfacing. Street grading, base preparation and surfacing of local streets shall be carried out by the subdivider according to this ordinance [this appendix]. Grading, base preparation, and surfacing of collector and arterial streets shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the city. See Illustrations 2, 3, 4, and 5 [at the end of this appendix]. Approval of the subdivider's plans is required by the city engineering department. 
                  9.  Storm drainage. Drainage analysis shall be based on the provisions set forth in the City of Statesboro Drainage Control Ordinance and the Flood Plain Management Ordinance. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersecting drains, drop inlets, bridges, and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider according to the plans and specifications approved by the city's engineering department. Approval of the subdivider's plans by the city engineering department is required after the city council approves the preliminary plan.

                  (c)  Pipes up to 36 inches in diameter shall have a flared end section; pipes larger that 36 inches in diameter shall have winged head walls or other prior approved end treatments. 
                  (d)  Pipes of dissimilar size shall be vertically aligned with their energy grade line or shall have the crowns of the pipes set at matching elevations when similar size pipes converge at a manhole or other structure. 
                  (e)  All pipe joints, in addition to the required rubber gaskets, shall be covered with approved geotextile material of sufficient width to be secured to the pipe and completely encircle the joint with a 50 percent overlap. An alternative to this proposal may be the placement of grout around each pipe joint. 
                  (f)  Pipes located on property lines shall have a minimum depth of cover to the finish grade of 36 inches. Where such depth of cover cannot be maintained, the pipe shall be relocated in such a manner that the property owner will not be impaired in the construction of fences and other amenities normally located at such locations and a sufficient easement provided for the relocated position of the pipe. 
                  (g)  Pipe gradients shall provide self-cleaning velocities without scour (2 - 9 fps). 
                  (h)  The city requires the installation of reinforced concrete storm drain pipes and Georgia DOT standard drop inlets when curb and gutter is used in new subdivision roads. The spacing between drop inlets shall not exceed 300 feet. Maximum length of pipe runs shall not exceed 300 feet. All drainage pipes shall begin and end in either inlets, manholes, or end treatments. 
                  (i)  Only reinforced concrete pipe will be approved for drainage systems which the city will be required to maintain. 
                  (3)  Curb and ditch inlets. All inlets shall be of the standard design. Curb inlets should be located at the end of corner curve radius. A drop inlet that consists of a grate on the gutter and a hood on the curb ( Ga DOT Standard Drop Inlet No. 1019) shall be used in the presence of a sidewalk along the road. No manhole or box cover shall be used in the sidewalk. 
                  (4)  Drainage swales. Swales with a velocity greater than five feet per second shall be paved a minimum of two feet wide and six inches deep. 
                  Swales shall have a 5:1 side slopes or flatter; however, if a swale traverses a wooded site, use of a 3:1 side slope may be submitted for approval by the city engineer to reduce impact on trees. 
                  Prior to use, drainage swales shall have sufficient vegetation to provide filtration and erosion stabilization. 
                  Drainage pipes or gutter flow shall not discharge into a swale. 
                  (5)  Maintenance. All ditch banks shall be constructed in a manner that the side slopes will not erode and can be maintained with riding grass cutting equipment. The type of soil encountered will be considered in selecting the proper slope. Side slopes flatter than 3:1 may be required if soil conditions warrant. 
                  (6)  Drainage design standards, methodology and criteria. All drainage design and analysis shall be based on the city's drainage control ordinance. 
                  Exemption: If the proposed subdivision encompasses less than 4.5 acres and the total combined impervious areas of all streets, sidewalks, driveways, parking areas and curb and gutter are less than one-half acres, then on-site detention is not required. 
                  Note: The developer is responsible for verifying that immediate off-site drainage systems (i.e., storm sewers, culverts, ditches, detention areas) are adequately sized to accept the storm water run-off from the proposed development. The developer will be required to upgrade said pipes or ditches if found necessary by the city engineer. 
                  (A)  Methodology. Two hydrological methods for computing surface runoff are hereby adopted: "The Rational Method" and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), Technical Release No. 55 FR-55; entitled "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds" or any other method recognized by engineering standards. 
                  (B)  Drainage design criteria. The following design criteria shall be used for either methodology utilized for computation: 
                  Design storm—Culverts crossing beneath public roadways (in subdivisions) must be designed to pass at least the 25-year frequency[,] 24-hour storm. All other storms water piping, except that associated with a detention pond outlet, shall be designed to pass at least the 10-year frequency 24-hour storm. The city recommends the oversizing of stormwater piping. 
                  (C)  General requirements.

                  14.  Use of concrete weirs or standpipe are preferred over undersize pipes. 
                  15.  Where cleared site conditions exist around detention or retention areas, the banks shall be sloped to proposed dry weather water surface elevation and planted for stabilization purposes. Where slopes are not practical or desired, other methods of bank stabilization will be used and noted on plans submitted. 
                  16.  Dredging, clearing, deepening, widening, straightening, stabilizing or otherwise altering natural water bodies or canals may be permitted by the city engineer only when a positive benefit can be demonstrated. Such approval by the city does not obviate the need for state or federal agency approval where applicable. 
                  (D)  Direct storm water discharge. 
                  (1)  Discharges to natural water bodies. Where a specific site requires a permit to allow direct discharge into a natural water body, methods of diffusing and filtering the discharge and of reducing velocity may be required. 
                  (2)  Final landscape design and planting shall not work against the storm water runoff controls and drainage concepts approved as part of the construction plan approval process. 
                  (3)  Rip rap. Sufficient rip rap shall be provided anywhere that soil scouring will occur because of excessive runoff velocities. Other energy dissipation will be considered. 
                  (E)  Drainage easements. All drainage easements offered to the city for dedication to public use shall have a minimum width of 25 feet or as shown in table below (section F). For underground storm drain pipes, the minimum width of the easement shall not be less than 25 feet. The applicant shall submit to the city engineer a request for permanent dedication of drainage systems for city maintenance.

                  All storm drainage right-of-ways shall be reviewed by the city engineer and upon approval will be recorded. 
                  (G)  Erosion and sediment control. Erosion and sedimentation controls shall be required on all sites. (See The State of Georgia "Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control" for details). When disturbed site is equal or greater than 1.10 of an acre, the applicant must apply for a land disturbing activity permit in accordance with the requirements of the City of Statesboro Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance. 
                  [(H)](J)  Lakes, ponds and waterways. Artificial or natural waterways, lakes, or ponds for recreation shall not be accepted for maintenance by the city. 
                  Waterways, lakes, ponds, detention or retention basins shall be maintained by either an established homeowners association or individual property owner(s). In either case, the final plat must indicate who will be responsible for maintenance. The city will not accept maintenance of drainage basins. 
                  Private maintenance provisions must be made to the satisfaction of the city engineer. Placing responsibility on the owner(s) of the property where the feature is located is allowed, if suitable notes and easements are provided on the final plat and other legal instruments.

                  1.  Lot arrangement, design, and shape generally. The lot arrangement, design, and shape shall be reasonably related to topography and shall not contain offsets, irregularities, or normally unusable elongations for the sole purpose of providing the required minimum lot area, providing access to a right-of-way through a narrow stem (commonly called a flag lot), or prohibiting access to a right-of-way from an adjacent lot with what is commonly called a spite strip. 
                  2.  Shape of lots. Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided, with a normal proportion of depth to width of two to one (2:1). 
                  3.  Access to lots. All lots shall abut a public right-of-way for a minimum length of thirty feet (30'). Subdivisions utilizing a condominium or similar ownership scheme are not required to meet this provision provided each lot has access to a public right-of-way through commonly-owned property. 
                  4.  Arrangement of lots. Side lot lines shall be substantially at a right angle to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
                  5.  Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where they are needed to provide for the separation of residential development from traffic arteries, expressways, railroads, high voltage power lines, gas transmission lines, cemeteries, commercial and industrial uses, or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography, environment, or orientation. In such instances, a planting screen easement a minimum of 25 feet wide shall be provided on the residential lot in addition to the required minimum lot area. No right of access shall be provided onto, through, or across the easement and no structure shall be placed upon it. 
                  6.  Resubdivision of lots within a residential subdivision. Lots within an existing residential subdivision shall not be further subdivided if such resubdivision would create lots of such size, shape, or orientation that their existence could alter or change the character of the recorded subdivision in terms of the visual quality or consistency of the established development pattern or adversely affect the property values or quality of life for residents or owners of lots within the recorded subdivision.
