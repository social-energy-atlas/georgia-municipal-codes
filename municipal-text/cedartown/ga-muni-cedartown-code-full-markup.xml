PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Cedartown, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 Code, as supplemented through March 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1969 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Laura Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Michael D. McRae, City Attorney, Mr. Robert T. Monroe, Associate City Attorney, Mr. David Johnson, City Manager, and Ms. Emily C. Shaw, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  PROCUREMENT AND SELECTION PROCEDURES 

                  Sec. 2-330. - Purpose. 
                  To establish procurement and selection procedures to purchase and contract for property, supplies, furnishings, equipment, labor, materials and services in an proper, efficient and economical manner, in compliance with applicable City of Cedartown (hereinafter referred to as the "city"), State of Georgia and federal laws and regulations.

                  Sec. 2-331. - Scope. 
                  All property, supplies, furnishings, equipment, labor, materials, services and other similar items, purchased in whole or in part by the city, shall be acquired in accordance with these procedures. 
                  ( Ord. No. 6-2017 , § A.1, 11-13-17) 
                  Sec. 2-332. - Compliance with applicable legislation. 
                  All procurements and contracts will be carried out in compliance with applicable state and federal laws, rules, regulations and procedures including, but not limited to, the: 
                  (1)  Georgia House Bill 1079; Public Works, hereinafter referred to as the "Public Works Bid Law," which provides requirements for bonding, advertising and contract award for public works projects. 
                  (2)  Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments or the Common Rule, as adopted by the DCA, which describes: bonding and insurance requirements, methods to use to obtain goods and services, record retention requirements, standards for financial management systems and monitoring and reporting performance. 
                  (3)  OMB Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State and Local Governments, which establishes principles and standards for determining costs allowable to grants, contracts and other agreements with state and local governments. 
                  Where conflicts exist, the most stringent applicable law or regulation shall be followed, whether local, state or federal. 
                  Federal laws and standards will be applicable in cases where federal monies are involved with the procurement or contract. Federal procurement standards and guidelines are viewed as "in addition to, not to take the place of" local and state policies and procedures. State law is more restrictive in some cases and therefore prevails. If local standards are more restrictive, then they prevail. 
                  ( Ord. No. 6-2017 , § A.2, 11-13-17) 
                  Sec. 2-333. - Procurement procedures. 
                  All procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner that provides maximum free and open competition. 
                  (1)  Solicitations of offer will: 
                  a.  Contain a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured. 
                  b.  Clearly state all requirements bidders must fulfill such as adequate licensing, as well as the factors used to evaluate bids or proposals. 
                  (2)  Quoted prices of vendors and suppliers will remain confidential until all quotes are received and the selection made, purchase order issued or all quotes rejected. The quote of one person will not be used to negotiate a lower quote from another. 
                  (3)  Awards will be made only to responsible contractors that possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. 
                  (4)  All other factors being equal, the city should accept the quote of the lowest responsible proposer, but may reject any and all quotes or bids. 
                  (5)  Reasonable attempts will be made to utilize small, minority and local businesses. Local vendor preference applies to all informal and formal procurements greater than $10,000.00 excluding construction projects; professional and consulting services, federally funded projects; and online/electronic sealed bid/reverse auctions. A local vendor's bid will be awarded if the bid is within two percent of the non-local vendor's bid who otherwise would have received the award of the contract. 
                  (6)  No purchase or contract shall be divided into parts for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of the competitive bid law or the public works law. Any such partial contract shall be void. 
                  ( Ord. No. 6-2017 , § A.3, 11-13-17) 
                  Sec. 2-334. - Methods of procurement. 
                  All procurements shall be carried out in compliance with one of the following four methods of procurement described below. 
                  (1)  Small purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are relatively simple and informal procurement methods that are sound and appropriate for the procurement of relatively small quantities of equipment, materials, supplies or other property. In accordance with the requirements of the competitive bid law, small purchase procedures may be utilized for such purchases costing in the aggregate less than $10,000.00. 
                  In accordance with the public works bid law, public works construction contracts of less than $100,000.00 may be let through the use of small purchase procedures without the need for sealed bids. 
                  Small purchase procedures may also be utilized for the procurement of professional services. 
                  When utilizing small purchase procedures, price or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources and, wherever possible, no less than three. Appropriate documentation of all small purchase procedures shall be maintained as required. 
                  The lowest responsible proposer shall be selected, except in cases when documented exceptions may be granted with the approval of the city manager or chief financial officer. 
                  Purchases less than the competitive bid law limit ($10,000.00), will be made in compliance with small purchase procedures. Competitive sealed bids may be used for smaller procurements if determined to be in the best interest of the city. Exceptions to this requirement may be granted by the city manager, for those purchases excluded from the competitive bid law requirements, when one of the following circumstances can be properly documented to substantiate the decision: 
                  a.  Items where the purchase price has been set by the federal government or the State of Georgia (e.g., state bid list); 
                  b.  Requirements to maintain a degree of continuity with the original or existing décor, equipment, or programs, where an attempt to quote could result in operational or functional inconsistency; 
                  c.  When a quote attempt results in no response, orders will be placed with the first reliable source with suitable price, quality and delivery; 
                  d.  When lowest or best price has been previously determined by historical purchases; or 
                  e.  When the purchasing officer determines that three quotes cannot feasibly be obtained. 
                  (2)  Competitive sealed bids. In accordance with the requirements of the competitive bid law, competitive sealed bids shall be taken on contracts for all labor, services, or work, or for the purchase or lease of materials, equipment, supplies, or other personal property involving $10,000.00 or more. Procurements of professional services are exempt from the competitive bid law. 
                  In accordance with the requirements of the public works law, competitive sealed bids must be utilized for public works construction projects totaling $100,000.00 or more. 
                  Sealed bids shall be publicly solicited through formal advertising. To be feasible to use competitive sealed bids, the following conditions must be present: 
                  a.  A complete, adequate and realistic specification or description of the purchase is available; 
                  b.  Two or more responsible vendors are willing and able to effectively compete for the business; and 
                  c.  The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed-price contract that allows selection of the successful bidder based principally on price. Cost plus a percentage of the cost is not allowed. 
                  Procurements utilizing competitive sealed bids shall comply with the following: 
                  a.  Sufficient time must be allowed between bid solicitation and the date set for opening of bids. 
                  b.  Bids must be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers. The invitation for bids must be publicly advertised (i.e., published at least once in The Cedartown Standard) or in accordance with applicable state law. 
                  c.  The invitation for bids, including specifications and pertinent attachments, must clearly define the items or services needed to allow the bidders to properly respond. 
                  d.  All bids must be opened publicly at the time and place stated in the invitation for bids. 
                  e.  A firm fixed-price contract award shall be made by written notice to the lowest responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the invitation for bids. If specified in the bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation costs and life cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts may only be used to determine low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are generally taken. 
                  f.  Any or all bids may be rejected when there are sound documented business reasons in the best interest of the city. 
                  (3)  Competitive negotiation. Competitive negotiation may be used if conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. Either a fixed-price or a cost-reimbursable type contract may be awarded, as appropriate. If competitive negotiation procedures are utilized, the following requirements apply: 
                  a.  Proposals shall be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources to permit reasonable competition. The request for proposals must be publicized and reasonable requests by other sources to compete must be honored to the maximum extent practicable. 
                  b.  The request for proposals shall identify all significant evaluation factors and their relative importance. 
                  c.  Mechanisms for technical evaluation of the proposals received, determinations of responsible vendors for the purpose of written or oral discussions and selection criteria for contract award, shall be provided. 
                  d.  Award may be made to the responsible offerer whose proposal will be most advantageous to the city, all factors considered. Unsuccessful offerers should be notified promptly. 
                  Competitive negotiation procedures may be used for procurement of professional services. When utilizing competitive negotiation procedures for procurement of professional services, competitor's qualifications shall be evaluated and selection shall be subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation for qualified competitors. 
                  (4)  Noncompetitive negotiation. Noncompetitive negotiation or "sole source" procurement is limited to the following situations: 
                  a.  The item or service is available from only one source. 
                  b.  Urgent public need or emergency will not allow for a delay caused by advertising. 
                  c.  After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate or only one response is received. 
                  Contracts awarded utilizing Noncompetitive Negotiation procedures shall be made with responsible contractors or venders who are able to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement document. Consideration shall be given to contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and other technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. 
                  When using the noncompetitive negotiation method of procurement, ensure that: 
                  a.  Proper documentation that one or more of the above circumstances existed; 
                  b.  There is no conflict of interest by the parties involved; and 
                  c.  Costs for the service(s) are clearly in line with applicable local, regional and/or state approved ranges or other acceptable industry standards.

                  To establish written standards of conduct to govern the performance of city officials and employees engaged in procurements and the awarding and/or administration of contracts. No official, employee, officer or agent of the city shall participate in selection or in the awarding or administration of a contract if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved.

                  Sec. 2-361. - Declaration of policy. 
                  It is essential to the proper government and administration of the city that the elected officials and employees be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial; that public service not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the city. Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private interest and public responsibilities of the city officials and employees, the public interest requires that the city protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of persons hereinabove named in situations where a conflict may exist. 
                  It is also essential to the efficient operation of the city that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. 
                  Accordingly, the standards hereinafter set forth must be so interpreted and understood as not unreasonable to frustrate or impede the desire or inclination to seek and serve in public office by those persons best qualified to serve. To that end the persons hereinabove named should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunity available to all other citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests except where a conflict of interest situation would necessarily result. The policy standards of ethical conduct that shall be applicable to the persons hereinabove named in the discharge of their official duties; to implement the objective of protecting the integrity of the city and to prescribe only such essential restrictions against conflict of interest as will not impose unnecessary barriers against public service.

Upon receiving any such animal, the city poundkeeper shall enter upon the records of the pound, in a book to be kept by him for such purpose, the date of impounding, a description of the animal impounded and a record as to whether or not such animal has been licensed and tagged. 
                  (b)  Notice. Not later than two days after the impounding of any animal under the provisions of this chapter, if the animal has been licensed and tagged, the poundkeeper or other city official shall attempt to notify the owner thereof. Any animal so licensed and tagged shall be kept, before disposition, pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. In addition to an attempt to notify the owner, written notice shall be posted for at least three days in a conspicuous place at the police department's location in the city.

Any animal which appears to be suffering from rabies, hydrophobia, mange or any other infectious or dangerous disease shall not be released, but may be destroyed as soon as such infection or disease is discovered, after the poundkeeper has received the opinion of a licensed veterinarian that it would be in the best interest of the public health and welfare to destroy the animal. Otherwise, the animal shall be kept until in the opinion of a licensed veterinarian it may be released to the owner.

                  Moving permit means that written document required to authorize the moving, transportation or relocation of any movable housing either within or without the corporate limits of the city.

                  (3)  The time of day or night that the moving shall take place. 
                  (4)  The fact that Southern Bell Telephone, Georgia Power Company, Falcon Cable TV Company and any and all other public utilities whose facilities may be affected, have been notified. 
                  (5)  Such other matters as the issuer deems proper. 
                  The terms of the permit shall be strictly adhered to by the mover; no deviation therefrom shall be permitted without the express written permission of the issuer. 
                  (d)  Application for a permit must be made at least 15 days prior to the proposed moving, at which time the issuer shall notify the chief of police, who shall furnish, at the time of moving, such necessary police escort to the mover as the police chief deems necessary to ensure the safety of the public. 
                  (e)  A sign evidencing that a structure is to be removed or located, as the case may be, upon any real property within the city shall be placed upon the property at least 15 days prior to the proposed removal or relocation. This sign shall comport with the general size requirements of signs evidencing a proposed change of property zoning within the city. 
                  (f)  The fee for such moving permit shall be as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges. In addition thereto, the movers shall deposit with the issuing authority of the city an amount as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges for each such movable housing structure to be transported either within or without the city, as a bond for damages to public property. This sum shall be returned to the mover within 15 days after such moving if no damage is done to public property.

                  The building inspector of the city is charged with the authority for the enforcement of this article. As such, in determining whether to issue a moving permit, he shall use the following criteria: 
                  (1)  No permit for movable housing shall be issued until notice of an application for a permit, to be made on forms approved by the city, has been given to the owners of all adjoining property upon which the building or structure is to be moved. Each adjoining property owner, including those adjacent to the property and across the street directly therefrom, shall be allowed to be heard before the building inspector before the granting of a permit occurs. 
                  (2)  Whether the proposed housing can be properly brought to the level of minimum standard requirements contained in the building code of the city, and as generally required pursuant to the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 8-2-1 et seq. The aforesaid provisions of state law generally deal with the construction or alteration of buildings. Those sections of this Code or state law applicable to movable housing shall be used as criteria for determining the feasibility of issuing a permit to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Whether the structure, when complete, will have a fair market value which is not less than 80 percent of the assessed fair market value of adjoining comparable properties, for tax purposes, in the general vicinity and neighborhood within the city where this structure is to be located. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the structure's presence in the area will not diminish property values. 
                  (4)  Whether the structure can safely and properly, using reasonable construction standards and those contained in this Code, be properly placed upon the property, constructed, repaired and maintained as a residential dwelling unit fit and safe for occupancy by the general public. 
                  (5)  Whether the placing of a movable housing structure, together with all work or other construction to be accomplished in the vicinity of the property will create a health, safety or public hazard or nuisances within the corporate limits of the city. In determining whether the conditions could constitute a nuisance, the building inspector shall consider the criteria contained in section 38-61. 
                  (6)  Whether the applicant has, within five years before the date of the application, had a building permit revoked, failed to comply with code standards and requirements of the building inspector or otherwise been cited for significant violations of the building codes and ordinances of the city. 
                  (Code 1969, § 5-90)

                  (a)  A permit, once issued, may not be transferred from one person to another, or from one licensed location for the moving of a structure contemplated by this article to another location, without the express written consent of the building inspector having been first obtained. 
                  (b)  The building inspector shall have full power and authority to deny, revoke, refuse to grant, suspend or amend, as might be needed, any moving permit to be granted under this article. 
                  (c)  Since the criteria and establishment of this permit also requires later enforcement and compliance with this article, this permit and the accompanying building permit shall be subject to revocation for cause. 
                  (d)  Before taking any action adverse to an applicant or permit holder, the building inspector shall conduct a hearing at which all interested parties may be heard concerning the grant, renewal, refusal or suspension of any license privileges granted under this article. Appeal of any decision of the building inspector shall be to the city commission.

                  Sec. 18-117. - Hearing. 
                  Upon written application within 30 days of the decision of the building inspector, any applicant or other party aggrieved by any decision pursuant to this article shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the city commission. At that time the aggrieved party shall be allowed to present evidence, cross examine opposing witnesses, or present any and all documentation concerning the application or decision. Failure to make timely appeal of the decision within the time period shall cause the decision to become final and unappealable. The hearing shall be conducted within 30 days from the date of a timely application and the final decision of the city commission in this regard shall be accomplished in writing and communicated to the aggrieved party. The review before the city commission shall be conducted pursuant to the criteria contained in this article for review by the building inspector, and shall be considered a de novo consideration of the decision.

The applicant shall furnish the lot owner of record, name of the decedent, date of death and all other pertinent information required in the application. The city clerk, or any other authorized delegate of the city, may accept applications and ensure that assistance is given in location of grave spaces. All ultimate liability and responsibility for grave opening shall be directly the duty and obligation of the funeral home, firm or other applicant who opens the grave space. Failure to adhere to the requirements of this application, or other provision of this chapter by any applicant, shall result in punishment pursuant to the provisions of section 1-13. In the event of second or subsequent violations, this conduct may cause a forfeiture of the license of the funeral home or other business to operate within the corporate limits of the city.

                  (1)  All graves shall be dug and prepared only through the direct supervision and control of a licensed funeral home duly authorized to conduct business within the respective state and political subdivision thereof where the entity is engaged in the regular operation of a funeral home.

                  (4)  No fencing, sidewalk, or other enclosure of a grave, lot, or burial space will be allowed. Coping walls will be allowed upon approval by the parks and cemeteries superintendent, provided, however, that any grave sites with coping walls must be topped with stone or marble and must be completely cleared of any grass, weeds, or other vegetation. 
                  (5)  Nothing will be permitted on the gravesites except headstones, coping walls, stone or marble foot markers, flowers, and lighted candleholders. 
                  (6)  All flowers are to be in a container after the preparation and completion of the initial internment. 
                  (7)  No flowers, trees, shrubs or other plants shall be planted on any lot. 
                  (8)  Vandalism; trespass. 
                  a.  No person shall damage, injure, obliterate or desecrate any grave or lot. 
                  b.  No person shall trespass upon any grave. 
                  c.  No person shall cut, deface, mutilate or otherwise damage or injure any monument or other memorial or marker.

                  Further, there are additional restrictions and curfews for Greenwood Cemetery, Northview Cemetery and Southview Cemetery, as set forth in [section] 26-9.1. Strict enforcement and adherence to these curfews, and the potential for multiple violations thereof, are also more specifically defined in section 26-9.2 of this Code. 
                  (Code 1969, § 6-12; Ord. No. 11-1998, § 1, 4-13-98; Ord. No. 17-1998, § 1, 4-20-98; Ord. No. 2-2003, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-03; Ord. No. 18,2006, §§ 1(1)—1(4), 11-13-06; Ord. No. 4,2007, § 1, 5-14-07) 
                  Section 26-9.1. - Curfew. 
                  A mandatory curfew is hereby established for Greenwood Cemetery, Northview Cemetery and Southview Cemetery. This curfew is 30 minutes after sunset (which for purposes of this section shall be considered twilight or the end of daylight hours) until dawn (the beginning of daylight hours). No person shall have the right to be within, remain, loiter, or otherwise congregate individually, or in groups during the prohibited curfew hours.

                  Sec. 26-9.2. - Penalty for violation. 
                  Any person found in violation of the curfews established herein shall be subject to the penalties contained in the general penalty provisions of section 1-13 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Cedartown. As requested by the citizens of the community, the penalty section promulgated hereunder is established with significant penalties, as the court, in its discretion, (including incarceration, and/or fines and/or probation), may determine to impose. Further, the curfew violation offense of this chapter shall be separate and apart from any offense of loitering, malicious, mischief, or other violations which may occur when conduct is being manifested, to authorize charges for multiple offense violators. 
                  The penalties imposed by this section, including conduct which results in multiple violations, is to be strictly enforced by the police department of the city and vigorously prosecuted by the city solicitor. It is apparent that the need to stop random vandalism, loitering, and criminal activity in the cemeteries in violation of curfew hours has become of such significance that the strict enforcement thereof is necessary.

                  Sec. 26-10. - Corner markers required. 
                  All purchasers of municipal cemetery grave spaces shall be required to place corner markers on the space. These markers shall be designated by the city on lot locations and at various areas within the city cemeteries, so as to more accurately and clearly designate the lot spaces, sections or other areas within city cemeteries.

                  Sec. 26-11. - Abandoned lots; termination of owners' rights. 
                  The abandonment of or termination or forfeiture of an owner's rights in any grave, lot, space, or portion thereof within a cemetery of the city shall be accomplished pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 44-5-211 as it is presently enacted or from time to time may be amended or revised. 
                  (Code 1969, § 6-14) 
                  Sec. 26-12. - Loitering. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, create a nuisance, remain after being told to leave or disperse or otherwise attempt to conduct any meeting, rally or similar activity in any public cemetery in the city. 
                  (Code 1969, § 6-6) 
                  Sec. 26-13. - Damage to property. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person to mutilate, deface, destroy, move or otherwise damage in any manner any article, monument, grave space or similar object in any public cemeteries of the city. 
                  (Code 1969, § 6-7) 
                  Sec. 26-14. - Removal of property. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person to remove any personal property, item, article, flower, monument or similar properties from within any areas of the public cemeteries of the city, regardless of whether any such items have monetary value.

                  Sec. 26-15. - Compliance with Code mandatory; exceptions. 
                  (1)  From November 8, 1999, forward, all applicants for grave openings and all others who wish to place monuments or grave enhancements in any city owned cemetery shall comply with all applicable regulations contained in this Code. This includes all requirements as to height, materials, location, width, and all other physical aspects of such monuments. The city will also require applicants to obtain a permit from the city manager or the director of cemeteries prior to any work done in any city cemetery. 
                  (2)  However, in view of the many varied styles, shapes, sizes and varieties of existing monuments and grave markers that are not in compliance with existing cemetery regulations, the city qualifies subsection (1) as follows: 
                  Any person wishing to place a grave marker or monument that is similar or comparable to other existing monuments, even if the existing monuments or enhancements do not comply with city regulations, shall be permitted to do so. Such persons may also request a variance from existing regulations, which will be reviewed and considered by the cemetery director and city manager, prior to the issuance of a permit. No permits, however, shall be issued for any proposed marker, monument or grave enhancement that is not comparable or similar to an existing monument, and not in compliance with the city cemetery regulations. 
                  (3)  No person, firm, or corporation, or contractor shall perform any work, including, but not limited to, any excavation, filling, building, placement, or other similar work in or on any city cemeteries on Saturdays and Sundays, except with the express written permission of the city manager or cemetery director. 
                  (Ord. No. 17-1999, §§ 1—3, 11-8-99) 
                  Sec. 26-16. - Reopening closed graves and moving contents. 
                  (a)  In all city cemeteries, no person, firm, or corporation may reopen any grave, lot, or burial plot which has previously been closed and in which a body has previously been buried, except in the following limited circumstances: 
                  (1)  In the course of a criminal investigation in which it is deemed necessary by law enforcement officials to perform a medical or other forensic examination on the body of the deceased, and such examination is authorized by an order from a court of competent jurisdiction; 
                  (2)  In the course of any civil litigation involving the personal injury or wrongful death of the deceased, in which an additional medical or other forensic exam is sought by parties to the litigation and authorized by an order from a court of competent jurisdiction; 
                  (3)  Where otherwise authorized by an order from any court, administrative body, or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction in the normal exercise of its duly authorized powers and authority; 
                  (4)  Where specifically consented to and authorized in writing by all children or nearest next of kin of the deceased if there are no children, upon proof that the applicants are in fact the decedent's children or next of kin, and the applicants have requested that the decedent's body be removed and buried in another location; 
                  (5)  Where it can be verified from city records that a body was inadvertently or erroneously buried in the wrong lot, and the children or nearest next of kin of the deceased request in writing that the body be removed and relocated to the proper site for this reason; 
                  (6)  In such other circumstances in which removal and/or relocation of a body may be required, and for good cause, as may be determined in the sole discretion of the city manager and parks and cemeteries director. 
                  (b)  Any person, firm, or corporation seeking the removal of the body of the deceased from a grave located in a city cemetery shall complete all affidavits, forms, releases, contracts and any other documents as may be required by the parks and cemeteries director. 
                  (c)  The city shall not participate in any manner whatsoever in the physical removal of any bodies, graves, caskets, coffins, or vaults, and all costs of any such services shall be paid solely by the applicant. Furthermore, the city shall not be liable for any claims for personal injury, wrongful death, emotional distress, property damage, or any other claims of any kind or character arising out of a request submitted under this section.

                  Structural erosion, sedimentation and pollution control practices: Practices for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by utilizing the mechanical properties of matter for the purpose of either changing the surface of the land or storing, regulating or disposing of runoff to prevent excessive sediment loss. Examples of structural erosion and sediment control practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures and sediment traps, etc. Such practices can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
                  Trout streams: All streams or portions of streams within the watershed as designated by the Wildlife Resources Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources under the provisions of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20, in the rules and regulations for water quality control, chapter 391-3-6 at www.gaepd.org. Streams designated as primary trout waters are defined as water supporting a self-sustaining population of rainbow, brown or brook trout. Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproductions, but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs. 
                  Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control measures: Measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with: 
                  (a)  Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing longterm vegetative cover, or 
                  (b)  Temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or 
                  (c)  Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass. 
                  Such measures can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
                  Watercourse: Any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater. 
                  Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority; 
                  (5)  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3, "definitions", to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds; 
                  (6)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in subsections 38-134(c)(15) and (16), no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  (7)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture;

                  Sec. 38-134. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirement of subsections (b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in this subsection and subsection (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in [subsections] (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2); 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16), there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  (ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  (ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c). 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2,2010, § IV, 1-11-10) 
                  Sec. 38-135. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city building inspector to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city building inspector and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 38-134(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD rule 391-3-7-10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except than any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 38-134(c)(15) and (16) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 38-134(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including road ways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm ater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 38-134(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) [are] met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.

The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.

The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties.

Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  (2)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article of the terms of the permit. 
                  (3)  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

                  (a)  The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a vacant property registry as a mechanism to protect neighborhoods from becoming blighted through a lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are vacant.

Difficulties often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of vacant real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety, and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article. 
                  (c)  This vacant property registry will require the owner to provide the City with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of state and federal law.

                  (a)  For purposes of this article, the term "outside fire protection" means that service, provided pursuant to this article, granted to residents who reside outside of the corporate limits of the city and who otherwise meet all criteria for receiving protection from the city's fire department in the case of any emergency which requires fire assistance. 
                  (b)  No dwelling or other improved property shall be registered under this article unless the property is located within five road miles from the city fire station, as promulgated by the city commission. 
                  (c)  No call outside the corporate limits of the city shall be answered by the fire department unless and until the property to be protected has, within 24 hours in advance of such call, complied with all conditions and requirements of this article.

                  (a)  Application; payment of fee. Any owner, or designee of any owner, of any property outside of the corporate limits which is to be subject to the provisions of this article affording outside fire protection shall apply for registration with the city clerk's office. The applicant shall provide such information as may, from time to time, be requested by the city to properly register any such property for outside fire protection. Such owner, or the owner's designee, of any property properly registered with the city shall pay such annual registration fee as designated by the city for each residence, plant or other insured dwelling, as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges in appendix C of this Code; except that out buildings and other improvements considered insured as a part of the curtilage of a residence shall be included with the registration fee. 
                  (b)  Exemptions from fee. Church buildings, fellowship halls and other such similar structures on the same site location may apply for exemption from the fee to be paid pursuant to this section provided they otherwise meet all criteria for outside fire protection. However, church-owned residential property (e.g., a parsonage) is not applicable for exemption under this subsection. 
                  (c)  Records. The city shall keep records of all outside fire protection registrations readily available for public inspection during normal business hours so as to accurately allow the fire department to determine what property outside the corporate limits is properly subject to the provisions of this article granting outside fire protection to such property. 
                  (d)  Proration of fee; refunds. If any properly registered owner, or the owner's designee, applies for registration at any time other than during annual renewal, the annual fee shall be subject to a minimum six-month fee or proration, depending upon the month of registration, as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges. Proration of the registration fee shall be 1/12 of the annual fee for each month or part of a month registered, in addition to the standard administration fee, but not to exceed the annual fee rate. The same calculation shall be used in the event of a request for a rebate, refund or other alleged right of proration due to an owner selling the dwelling, loss of the dwelling by fire, registration of the dwelling after the first of the year or similar circumstances. Any refunds must be applied for at the time of cancellation. Fees shall be as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges in appendix C of this Code. 
                  (e)  Renewal. Not later than February 1 of each calendar year, the registrant shall renew and pay the applicable fee for annual outside fire protection registration. Late payments shall result in termination of outside fire protection, and a 15 percent penalty shall be assessed for late registration and reinstatement.

                  (b)  Nothing contained in this article shall impose any liability upon the city or its commission, staff, employees, agents or assigns for failure to extinguish a fire, failure to prevent a fire from spreading, or otherwise conducting any acts in attempting to provide outside fire protection to any property improvement, dwelling or other structure owned by any registrant.

                  ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

                  Sec. 46-1. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Cedartown, of Polk County, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. No. 12-2008, § 1(Art. 1, § A), 8-11-08) 
                  Sec. 46-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of Cedartown, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 12-2008, § 1(Art. 1, § B), 8-11-08) 
                  Sec. 46-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. No. 12-2008, § 1(Art. 1, § C), 8-11-08) 
                  Sec. 46-4. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and; 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  ARTICLE IV. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 46-65. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  [Anchors.] New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  [Materials.] New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  [Methods.] New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  (a)  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  (i)  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  (ii)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and, 
                  (iii)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  (b)  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  (c)  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  [Heating, air conditioning.] All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  [Manufactured homes.] Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  [Water-supply systems.] New and replacement water-supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  [Sanitary sewage systems.] New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  [On-site waste disposal systems.] On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
                  (10)  [Nonconformity.] Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not complaint [compliant] with the provisions of this chapter shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. No. 12-2008, § 1(Art. 4, § A), 8-11-08) 
                  Sec. 46-66. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 46-65(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  (a)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 46-67(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  (a)  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (b)  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  (ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  (c)  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 46-65(6) above) 
                  (d)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  (ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  (iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (a) and (c), above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-26 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (a)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  (b)  Only if subsection (a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV.

                  Sec. 46-67. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-26, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 46-26, then the Cedartown Building Official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions ([subsections] (2) and (3)) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 46-65(4) "Elevated buildings". 
                  (a)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The Cedartown Building Official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-26 may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 46-65(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  The Cedartown Building Official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 46-51(1)(c) and (3)(b)(2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 46-80. - Variance procedures. 
                  (A)  The Cedartown Planning Commission as established by the Cedartown City Commission shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (B)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Cedartown Building Official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (C)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Cedartown Planning Commission may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Polk County, Georgia, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (D)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (E)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (F)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (G)  In reviewing such requests, the Cedartown Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (H)  Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  (i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  (ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
                  (iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The Cedartown Building Official records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (I)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Cedartown Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  Accessory structure means a structure having minimal value and used for parking, storage and other nonhabitable uses, such as garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, hay sheds and the like. 
                  Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a firewall or is separated by an independent perimeter load-bearing wall, shall be considered "new construction". 
                  Appeal means a request for a review of the Cedartown Building Official's interpretation of any provision of this chapter. 
                  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
                  Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in section 46-26. 
                  Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
                  Base flood elevation (BFE) [means] the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for zones AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1-V30, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year. 
                  Basement means that portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
                  Building means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage. 
                  Critical facility means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. Critical facilities include: 
                  (a)  Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic, or water-reactive materials;

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.

                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully complaint [compliant] with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  ARTICLE VII. - COMMERCIAL WASTE 

                  Sec. 50-145. - Purpose. 
                  Excessive amounts of fats, oils and grease, grit, sand and other solid or viscous materials can cause blockage and obstruction in the sanitary sewer system, causing untreated wastewater to overflow into the environment. Much of the waste material that has the potential to cause blockage or obstruction originates from commercial facilities, such as food preparation and vehicle maintenance facilities. 
                  This article sets forth minimum and uniform requirements for the treatment and disposal of commercial waste into the sanitary sewer system, and the transportation and ultimate disposal of commercial waste sludge and byproducts. 
                  The objectives of this article are: 
                  • To minimize the discharge of pollutants associated with commercial waste discharged into the sanitary sewer system that may interfere with normal operation of the system, and 
                  • To assure that the sludge and byproducts removed from commercial waste treatment systems are transported and disposed of in accordance with chapter 391-3-6-.24 of the rules and regulations of the state department of natural resources, environmental protection division.

After the designation by ordinance of an historic property or of an historic district, no material change in the appearance of such historic property, or of a structure, site, object or work of art within such historic district, shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof, unless or until the application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the commission.

When considering applications for certificates of appropriateness to the existing buildings, the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation Projects including the Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation shall be used as a guideline along with any other criteria adopted by the commission.

                  (e)  Response by commission. 
                  (1)  The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material changes in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved, and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style, and pertinent features of the other structures in the immediate neighborhood. 
                  (2)  The commission shall deny a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would have substantial adverse effects on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. 
                  (f)  Notice to property owners. At least seven days prior to review of a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected by reason of the application, and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. In cases where the commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application. 
                  (g)  Interior alterations. In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall not consider interior arrangement or use having no effect on exterior architectural features. 
                  (h)  Technical advice. The commission shall have the power to seek technical advice from outside its members on any application. 
                  (i)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application.

Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail to the applicant and all other persons who have required such notice in writing filed with the commission. 
                  (2)  Failure of the commission to act within 45 days shall constitute approval and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (j)  Actions taken by commission upon rejection of application. 
                  (1)  If the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued by him unless a variance is granted pursuant to this article. 
                  (k)  Variance. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions, or to interpret the meaning of the provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgement, best fulfill the purpose of this article. A variance will be granted pursuant to laws, ordinances and other regulations governing hearings and requests for variances as they apply to those applications for such variances in the city. 
                  (l)  Conformance with certificate of appropriateness required. 
                  (1)  All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. If work is performed not in accordance with such certificate, the commission or the building inspector shall issue a cease and desist order and all work shall cease. 
                  (2)  The city commission or the commission shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or historic district except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of this article or to prevent any illegal or improper act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. 
                  (m)  Certificate void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within 12 months of the date of issuance. Certificates of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of 18 months and are renewable. 
                  (n)  Recording of applications. The commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness and of all the commission's proceedings in connection with the application. 
                  (o)  Acquisition of property. The commission may, where such action is authorized by the city commission and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange or otherwise to the property or any interest therein. 
                  (p)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the city commission.

                  Sec. 54-62. - Zoning classification. 
                  All historic districts established in section 54-61 shall be classified as either an H-D or an H-P zoning classification.

                  Sec. 54-64. - Philpot historic district enterprise zone. 
                  (a)  [Designation.] In accordance with the amended urban redevelopment plan, the Georgia Enterprise Zone Employment Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-88-1 et seq. (hereinafter "The Act"), the Georgia Department of Community Affairs or the Georgia Department of Revenue, the city hereby designates the Philpot Street enterprise zone within the Cedartown Urban Redevelopment Area. This zone meets the qualifications and criteria of the Act due to the existence of the following: 
                  (b)  Pervasive poverty. Within the Philpot historic district enterprise zone, including adjacent Census tracts and block groups as identified by the U.S. Bureau of Census (2000), there are high levels of persons with an income to poverty ratio less than 1.0. Individual block groups within the Census tracts adjacent to this area suffer from poverty levels above 15 percent thus qualifying the area as a poverty area under O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6(b)(2). 
                  (c)  Under development. The area within the Philpot historic district [enterprise] zone is severely underdeveloped as compared with other areas of the city. Most of the structures within this area are dilapidated and many are empty. Such disrepair and inactivity satisfy the criteria of O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6(e). 
                  (d)  General blight. The proposed enterprise zone is within an approved urban redevelopment area as amended; thus, the criteria of O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6(f) demonstrating blight. 
                  (e)  Legal description. The area to be included in the Philpot historic district enterprise zone is specifically described as follows: 
                  Beginning from a point located at the intersection of the centerline of East Avenue and the centerline of South Philpot Street, extending south along the centerline of South Philpot Street to the south property line of lots abutting the south right-of-way of Herbert Street; thence in an easterly direction along that south property line of lots abutting the south right-of-way of Herbert Street to the centerline of Park Street; thence extending north along the centerline of Park Street to centerline of Noyes Street; then proceeding east along the centerline of Noyes Street to the rear property line of lots abutting the east right-of-way of Park Street; thence north along that rear property line of lots abutting the east right-of-way of Park Street to the centerline of East Avenue; then west along the centerline of East Avenue to the beginning at the intersection with the centerline of South Philpot Street.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  False alarm means a fire alarm signal or police signal from a privately owned fire or police signal device or system that is caused or created by anything other than an actual fire, burglary or robbery, in the premises where the device or system is located. Provided, however, that a false alarm shall not be construed to mean alarm signals caused by no fault of the user and caused by no apparent malfunction and also excluding an alarm signal caused by violent conditions of nature, such as, but not limited to lightning, tornadoes, or other extraordinary circumstances not reasonable subject to control by the alarm business or user. 
                  False alarm service charge means an administrative fee imposed by the city to defray the needless expense to the city for responding to false alarms and the services received that other businesses and the citizenry do not receive. The amount of the service charge shall be set forth in subsection (i) entitled "Service rate charge". 
                  Fire alarm signal means a signal indicating an emergency requiring immediate action of the fire department, including, but not limited to, an alarm from a manually operated fire alarm box, a water flow alarm, or an alarm from an automatic fire or smoke detection system or device. 
                  Fire equipment trouble alarm means an alarm indicating some form of malfunction or trouble with the fire protection or fire detecting system or device being monitored. Such trouble alarm does not indicate the need for emergency fire department response to the site, but only that the person responsible for maintenance of the system being monitored is to be notified of the trouble alarm signal. 
                  Police signal or burglar alarm signal means a signal from a manually operated or automatic device that indicates an emergency requiring immediate response by the police department. 
                  (b)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to establish requirements for the monitoring and receiving of fire and burglar alarm signals, and fire equipment trouble alarms at the communications office of the fire department and the police department. 
                  (c)  Connections. No signal other than a fire alarm signal or a fire equipment trouble alarm shall be connected to any alarm signal receiving equipment in the fire department. No signal other than a burglar, robbery or intrusion alarm shall be connected to any alarm signal receiving equipment in the police department. 
                  (d)  Automatic dialers. It shall be unlawful to key automatic dialer fire or burglar alarms to the city emergency number or the city switchboard. Such alarms shall be keyed to a private service that can then notify the police or fire department. 
                  (e)  Automatic cutoff system. All audible alarms, signals, bells or horns shall have an automatic cutoff system so that such alarm shall not operate for more than 20 continuous minutes for commercial alarms or ten continuous minutes for residential alarms. 
                  (f)  Transmission of false alarms. The transmission of false alarms to the fire department or the police department in excess of the allowable number of such alarms as contained in the service charge schedule shall authorize the imposition of a false alarm service charge. 
                  (g)  Accounting of false alarms. The police and fire departments shall maintain an accounting of false alarms on a monthly basis. Each calendar month shall constitute a new accounting period for determining the imposition of false alarm service charges. 
                  (h)  Key holder must live near system. It shall be unlawful to connect a system to the police or fire department's receiving equipment without a key holder living within a 15-mile radius of the premises where the device or system is located, in order to cut off the alarm and attend to matters arising from the alarm. 
                  (i)  Service charge rates. Service charge rates for alarm systems connected pursuant to this chapter shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  For the first violation of this section at any premises in a month, there shall be no charge. 
                  (2)  For the second violation of this section at any premises in a month, there shall be a fine of $50.00.

                  (j)  Termination of service. Service will be terminated after five false alarms in any calendar month. Service will be reinstated only after appropriate action has been taken to correct user deficiencies and the user has received approval from the appropriate chief.

                  Sec. 69-1. - Stormwater management facility requirements; plans required. 
                  (a)  For purposes of this chapter, "development" shall mean any land-disturbing activity greater than one-third acre or any building additions on commercial and/or industrial structures. The need for and approval of detention facilities in a residential land subdivision, commercial development, or industrial development will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the city engineer or his authorized representative. When the city engineer determines that such a facility is necessary and appropriate, developers shall hereby be required to provide retention and/or detention when rate of runoff of pre-development conditions is increased one percent or greater by post development conditions. It shall be the duty of an owner intending to develop land for residential, commercial and industrial purposes to prepare and submit to the city engineer for a review a stormwater management plan prior to engaging in any land-disturbing activities. No land-disturbing activities shall begin until the city engineer has approved this plan. Each developer's stormwater management plan will be prepared by a professional engineer or a land surveyor licensed by the state who will certify that the design meets minimum standards (≤ one percent) and will serve the intended purpose. A road-grading plan shall also be submitted as an integral part of the drainage plan. 
                  (b)  A currently accurate topographic map of the entire development with two-foot contours will be provided to the city manager and city engineer by the developer showing the routing of water upon its entrance to and exit from the development for both pre- and post development. The developer's designer (engineer and surveyor) shall delineate and label the 100-year flood plain elevation. 
                  (c)  Stormwater detention facilities shall be designed so that their peak release rates, when combined with those of all detention areas in the same basin, produce peak flow rates and flow velocities at the site's boundary line no greater than one percent over that which occurred at the same location for pre-developed conditions. This shall be provided for the two-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year frequency storm levels.

                  (2)  Detention and retention areas shall be located on tracts of land designated for this purpose on the preliminary and final plat with sufficient area around the perimeter to provide access for maintenance purposes and shall be immediately adjacent to or be provided with an access easement to a public street. The access and maintenance easement shall provide no less than 15 feet of width and an all-weather road no less than 12 feet in width. 
                  (3)  Upon completion of the developer's maintenance bond as required by section 69-5, all detention facilities and retention ponds shall be grassed and shall have a positive slope to an outlet in order to facilitate complete drainage. 
                  (4)  Trash, garbage, construction materials, construction by-products or other dirt or debris shall not be deposited in any part of the drainage system, including, but not limited to, open ditches, pipes, and cable lines. 
                  (5)  All design work is to be prepared and certified by a state registered professional engineer or land surveyor registered in Georgia.

The stormwater drainage system shall be defined as all existing or new facilities which convey stormwater runoff from a development including, but not limited to, ditches, swales, culverts, headwall, detention ponds, access routes to stormwater facilities, retention ponds, pond inlet and outlet structures and all stormwater drain related appurtenances. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to maintain the stormwater drainage system for one year from the date of approval of the project by the city. 
                  (b)  Should the developer fail to maintain the project to the city's satisfaction within this one-year period, the city may use the maintenance bond to finance the necessary maintenance required. The amount of the maintenance bond shall be ten percent of the total development cost. The maintenance bond shall be in a form and an amount satisfactory to the city. 
                  (c)  Upon the release of the maintenance bond for residential subdivisions, the responsibility of the developer for maintenance as described herein shall cease, and the property owner shall then be responsible for all detention and retention pond maintenance for commercial and industrial development. If the city or property owner discovers that there are latent defects in the system that could not have been discovered in the exercise of reasonable care, the developer shall be responsible for any maintenance or repair costs for these defects. 
                  (d)  Adjoining property owners shall provide the city with ingress and egress as necessary to perform any required maintenance work.

                  Sec. 69-45. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent . The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;

                  Sec. 69-48. - Postdevelopment stormwater management performance criteria. 
                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
                  (a)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  (1)  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  (2)  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and, 
                  (3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city manager or his/her designee are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (b)  Stream channel protection . Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  (1)  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  (2)  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  (3)  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (c)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the postdevelopment peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2) is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  (d)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  (e)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city manager or his/her designee before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city manager or his/her designee may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (f)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (a). The applicant may, if approved by the city manager or his/her designee, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (g)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include, but are not limited to, culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
                  (2)  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and, 
                  (3)  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual. 
                  (h)  Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.

                  (a)  The franchisee agrees and covenants, at its sole cost and expense, to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove from any public way any portion of its communication facilities when so required by the development services director by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, dedications of new public ways and the establishment and improvement thereof, widening and improvement of existing public ways, street vacations or closings, freeway construction, change or establishment of street grade, or the construction of any public improvement or structure by any governmental agency acting in a governmental capacity; provided that the franchisee shall in all cases have the privilege to temporarily bypass, in the authorized portion of the same public way upon approval by the development services director, any section of cable or any other facility required to be temporarily disconnected or removed. 
                  Upon the reasonable request of the development services director and in order to facilitate the design of city street and right-of-way improvements, the franchisee agrees to, at its sole cost and expense, locate, and if reasonably determined necessary by the city, to excavate and expose portions of its communication facilities for inspection so that the location of same may be taken into account in the improvement design, provided that, franchisee shall not be required to excavate and expose its facilities unless the franchisee's as-built plans and maps of its facilities submitted pursuant to section 70-100 of this article are reasonably determined by the development services director to be inadequate for purposes of this paragraph. The decision to relocate said facilities in order to accommodate the city's improvements shall be made by the development services director upon review of the location and construction of the franchisee's facilities. 
                  If the development services director determines that the project necessitates the relocation of the franchisee's then existing facilities, the city shall: within a reasonable time, which shall be no less than 30 days, prior to the commencement of such improvement project, provide the franchisee with written notice requiring such relocation. Provided, however, that in the event an emergency posing a threat to public safety, health or welfare, or in the event of an emergency beyond the control of the city and which will result in severe financial consequences to the city, the city shall give the franchisee written notice as soon as practicable; and provide the franchisee with copies of information for such improvement project and a proposed location for the franchisee's facilities so that the franchisee may relocate its facilities in other public ways in order to accommodate such improvement project. 
                  The franchisee shall complete relocation of its facilities at no charge or expense to the city so as to accommodate the improvement project at least ten days prior to commencement of the project. In the event of an emergency as described herein, the franchisee shall relocate its facilities within the time period specified by the development services director. 
                  The franchisee may, after receipt of written notice requesting a relocation of its facilities, submit to the city written alternatives to such relocation. The city shall evaluate such alternatives and advise the franchisee in writing if one or more of the alternatives is suitable to accommodate the work, which would otherwise necessitate relocation of the facilities. If so requested by the city, the franchisee shall submit additional information to assist the city in making such evaluation. The city shall give each alternative proposed by the franchisee full and fair consideration, within a reasonable time, so as to allow for the relocation work to be performed in a timely manner. In the event the city ultimately determines that there is no other reasonable alternative, the franchisee shall relocate its facilities as otherwise provided in this section. 
                  The provisions of this section shall in no manner preclude or restrict the franchisee from making any arrangements it may deem appropriate when responding to a request for relocation of its facilities by any person or entity other than the city, where the facilities to be constructed by said person or entity are not or will not become city-owned, operated or maintained facilities; provided, that such arrangements do not unduly delay a city construction project. 
                  (b)  The franchisee will indemnify, hold harmless, and pay the costs of defending the city against any and all claims, suits, actions, damages, or liabilities for delays on city construction projects caused by or arising out of the failure of the franchisee to relocate its facilities in a timely manner; provided, that the franchisee shall not be responsible for damages due to delays caused by the city or circumstances beyond the control of the franchisee.

                  (b)  In the event that the franchisee fails or refuses to promptly take the actions directed by the city, or fails to fully comply with such directions, or if emergency conditions exist which require immediate action, the city may enter upon the property and take such actions as are necessary to protect the public, the adjacent streets, utilities, public ways, to maintain the lateral support thereof, or actions regarded as necessary safety precautions; and the franchisee shall be liable to the city for the reasonable costs thereof.

                  This article shall be known as the "Cedartown Blighted Property Ordinance."

                  Sec. 70-126. - Purpose. 
                  The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including, but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services. 
                  In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, this commission, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations in Chapter 61, Urban Redevelopment, of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread. 
                  In recognition of the need for enhanced government services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvements thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by article IX, section II, paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

                  Sec. 70-175. - Enterprise and opportunity zones. 
                  In accordance with the urban redevelopment plan, the Georgia Enterprise Zone Employment Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-88-1 et seq. (hereinafter "the Act"), the applicable regulations regarding opportunity zones imposed by O.C.G.A. § 48-7-40 et seq., the Georgia Department of Community Affairs or the Georgia Department of Revenue, the city hereby designates certain enterprise and opportunity zones within the Cedartown Urban Redevelopment Area including as follows: 
                  (a)  The West Avenue opportunity zones. 
                  1.  West Avenue opportunity zone. The city hereby designates the West Avenue opportunity zone so to encourage subject property owners to additional state incentives and tax credits. This designation is subject approval by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs and Georgia Department of Revenue. 
                  2.  [Qualifications, criteria.] This zone meets the qualifications and criteria set forth in applicable law including: 
                  a.  Pervasive poverty. The West Avenue corridor suffers from pervasive poverty that is widespread throughout the nominated enterprise zone area and is evidenced and established by the fact that the census tracts and block groups within the West Avenue opportunity zone, as identified by the U.S. Bureau of Census (2000), demonstrate a high level of persons with an income-to-poverty ratio less than 1.0. All of the individual block groups within the census tracts within this corridor suffer from poverty levels above 15 percent. 
                  b.  Unemployment. Further, the general economic conditions within the West Avenue opportunity zone area have deteriorated due to adverse economic conditions. The area has experienced significant job loss due to the recent closings or relocations of vital manufacturing plants including Zartic Foods, Rome Plow and Varitech. Additionally, one of the largest remaining manufacturers, the HON Company, reduced its work force by as many as 100 employees in the last year. 
                  c.  General blight. The existence of general blight within this area is evidenced by the area being located within the Cedartown Urban Redevelopment Plan as defined by O.C.G.A. § 36-61-2 which plan has been adopted by the city in accordance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 36-61-1 et seq.

                  (b)  The downtown enterprise and opportunity zones. 
                  1.  Downtown enterprise zone. The city hereby designates the downtown enterprise zone. This zone meets the qualifications and criteria of the act due to the existence of the following: 
                  a.  Pervasive poverty. Within the downtown enterprise zone area, including all census tracts and block groups as identified by the U.S. Bureau of Census (2000), there are high levels of persons with an income-to-poverty ratio less than 1.0. All of the individual block groups within the census tracts within this corridor suffer from poverty levels above 15 percent thus qualifying the area as a pervasive poverty area under O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6(b)(2). 
                  b.  Underdevelopment. The area within the downtown enterprise zone is severely underdeveloped as compared with other areas of the city. There are current[ly] 22 unoccupied commercial buildings or spaces within the proposed downtown enterprise zone, resulting in a reduced collection of business license fees. Such underdevelopment satisfies the criteria of O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6(e). 
                  c.  General blight. The proposed enterprise zone is within an approved urban redevelopment area thus meeting the criteria of O.C.G.A. §36-88-6 (f) demonstrating blight. 
                  d.  Legal description. The downtown enterprise zone is specifically described as follows: 
                  Beginning at the intersection of the centerline of Main Street and the centerline of East Avenue, the boundary runs east along the centerline of East Avenue to the centerline of South Philpot Street; then south along the centerline of South Philpot Street to the centerline of East Ware Street; then east along the centerline of East Ware Street to the centerline of the Norfolk-Southern Railroad; then south and west along that centerline to the centerline of the Seaboard Railroad; then south and east along the centerline of the Seaboard Railroad to the centerline of East Gibson Street; then west along the centerline of East Gibson Street to the centerline of Rock Street; then south along the centerline of Rock Street to the centerline of Marietta Street; then west along the centerline of Marietta Street to the centerline of Main Street; the south along the centerline of Main Street to the centerline of Canal Street; then west along the centerline of Canal Street to the centerline of College Street; then north along the centerline of College Street to the centerline of Prior Street; then east along the centerline of Prior Street to the centerline of Main Street; and, then north along the centerline of Main Street to the beginning at the intersection with the centerline of East Avenue. 
                  2.  The Main Street opportunity zone. The city has determined that a certain area within the downtown enterprise zone further qualifies as an opportunity zone.

                  (b)  This zone meets the qualifications and criteria set forth in applicable law including: 
                  (1)  Pervasive poverty. The western portion of Cedartown suffers from pervasive poverty that is widespread throughout the nominated area and is evidenced and established by the fact that the Census tract and block group containing the Wissahickon Avenue opportunity zone, as identified by the U.S. Bureau of Census (2000), demonstrates a high level of persons with an income to poverty ratio less than 1.0 and suffer from a poverty level above 15 percent. 
                  (2)  Unemployment.

Additionally, one of the largest remaining manufacturers, the HON company, reduced its work force by as many as 100 employees in the last year. 
                  (3)  General blight.

There shall be no more than one such exemption per homestead. The value of the homestead in excess of the exempted amount shall remain subject to ad valorem taxation by the city. No resident shall be qualified to receive the benefits of such homestead exemption unless an affidavit is filed with the city clerk or county tax authority, giving the resident's age and any additional information as may be required to enable a proper determination to be made as to whether such owner is entitled to the exemption. After approval of homestead exemption it shall not be necessary to annually apply for the exemption. It shall be the duty of the owner to notify the proper taxing authority if the residence becomes ineligible for exemption because of transfer of title, death or failure to reside in the residence. The exemption application must be filed between January 2 and March 31 of each year, as required. Failure to timely file will result in no exemption being allowed for that taxable year.

Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the commission from authorizing special billing in accordance with state law when a timely tax digest is not submitted by the county. 
                  Sec. 74-15. - Delinquent tax executions; liens; related matters. 
                  (a)  As soon as practicable after the last due date for payment of taxes, the city clerk, or other official of the city, is authorized and directed to issue executions for the principal amount of all taxes due, and any interest and penalty up to the date of issuance of execution.

Each execution issued under this section shall be a general lien against the person against whom the levy and execution is made. Further, this execution shall constitute a special lien against the property, returned or assessed for taxation for which the writ of execution was issued. 
                  (c)  All executions issued under this section shall be entered upon the appropriate dockets of the county to give notice of the levying and fi. fa. of such execution.

For purposes of this section, "error" does not mean that the owner thereof desires to contest the amount of taxes owed, but only refers to clerical errors in billing, incorrect property, incorrect ownership, or other technical irregularities in the tax digest. 
                  (b)  Any personal property assessments and taxes within the city which are deemed uncollectible after diligent attempts have been made to collect same by the city clerk may be brought to the attention of the city commission, at a regular meeting thereof.

If the purchaser or transferee of a business governed by this article fails to withhold the required amount of any delinquent taxes due hereunder from the purchase price, he shall be personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells or transfers his business, or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs later. In addition, the city may refuse to issue a certificate of authority to collect the tax due under this article to any purchaser failing to withhold any past due taxes from the purchase price until such taxes have been paid and any deficiency or other tax liability of the prior operator hereunder have been satisfied.

                  The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer and the methods to be used in construction shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the county. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Water Pollution Control Federation (WPCF) Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply. Additionally, the following materials and methods shall apply to building sewers within the city supervision: 
                  (1)  The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM Specification A74, latest revision, or equal; ductile iron pipe, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Specification A21.51, latest revision, or equal; or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe, ASTM Specification D3034, latest revision. All joints shall be tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe with bolted mechanical joints may be required by the superintendent where the sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe, except that plastic pipe may be acceptable if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the superintendent. 
                  (2)  The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the superintendent, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot. Furthermore, the appropriate requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) shall be followed. 
                  (3)  The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost and the building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and with straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. Building sewers shall not be placed in the same trench with water service lines. 
                  (4)  An excavation required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the superintendent. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM Specification C12, latest revision, except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected and approved. 
                  (5)  All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight Push-on joints for cast iron soil pipe shall have neoprene gaskets in accordance with the requirements of ASTM C-564. Push-on joints for ductile iron pipe shall also have neoprene gaskets and be installed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PVC pipe joint material shall be of the bell and spigot type, sealed with a rubber "O"-ring gasket, having a composition and texture which is resistant to the common ingredients of sewage, industrial wastes (including oils) and groundwater, and which will endure permanently under the conditions likely to be imposed by this use. Installation of the gasket shall be done in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's instructions using all the necessary materials, lubricants and equipment recommended by the manufacturer. Other jointing materials may be used only when approved by the superintendent. 
                  (6)  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, the city shall, at the owner's expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, and install a 45-degree elbow with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at an elevation of at least one-tenth foot above the invert of the public sewer. A neat smooth joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the superintendent.

                  Sec. 82-328. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
                  (a)  Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed-discharges must be submitted under section 82-324, above. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 83-320, 82-322, and 82-323 above. 
                  (b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 or RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  (d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  (e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.

                  (1)  BOD surcharge per pound—B.O.D. O and M, cost over 365 × BOD average pounds per day plant—BODR. 
                  (2)  T.S.S. surcharge per pound—Same basis. 
                  (3)  Therefore, the surcharge rate using the aforesaid calculations is as follows: 
                  B.O.D - surcharge = Q × 8.33 × (BODi - 240) × BODR 
                  T.S.S - surcharge = Q × 8.33 × (TSSi-240) × TSSR 
                  (4)  The sum of the B.O.D. surcharge and T.S.S. surcharge = total surcharge. 
                  Q = Industry flow in billing period. 
                  BODi = Industry average B.O.D. in billing period. 
                  TSSi = Industry average T.S.S. in billing period. 
                  BODR = B.O.D. surcharge rate from subsection (d). 
                  TSSR = T.S.S. surcharge rate from subsection (d). 
                  (d)  Rate adjustment. The surcharge rate may be analyzed from time to time by the city, and adjusted based upon the aforesaid calculations, so as to maintain the surcharge amount at the cost of capital improvements for the treatment of industrial sewage by the water pollution control facility of the city. 
                  (e)  Right to establish additional surcharge. Nothing contained in the above statement of rate of surcharge or method of calculation shall prohibit the city from hereafter establishing a method of surcharge for oil and grease calculations, excess capacity of flow into the plant for an industrial user or otherwise establishing additional methods for calculations of surcharge. 
                  (f)  Measurement of flow in computing surcharges. The volume of flow used in computing industrial waste surcharges shall be based upon metered, estimated or prorated water consumption as shown in the records of meter reading maintained by the city water department. In the event that a person discharging wastes into the city sanitary sewer system produces evidence to the superintendent that a significant portion of the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not reach the city sanitary sewer, an estimated percentage of total water consumption to be used in computing charges may be agreed upon between the superintendent and the persons discharging industrial wastes into said sewer, provided that said agreement shall be approved by the city commission. 
                  (g)  Disputed analyses; regauging and sampling of wastes. In the event that an analysis of wastes, determined by the samplings and gauging of wastes from a person or industry by the city is disputed; a program of resampling and gauging, with subsequent chemical determination may be instituted as follows: 
                  (1)  The person or industrial user interested must submit a request for re-sampling and gauging of their wastes to the Superintendent by letter and bind themselves to bear the expenses incurred by the City in the re-sampling and gauging and subsequent chemical determination of the wastes. 
                  (2)  The chemist or engineer employed by the company responsible for the request submitted to the City must confer with the Superintendent or with the person in charge of gauging and sampling. They will establish the length of the rerun and the methods to be employed to determine the flow and to sample the flow. 
                  (3)  The chemist or engineer engaged by the person or industry may be present during the gauging and sampling operation and also in the City laboratory during the chemical determination of the analysis. 
                  (4)  The results of the analysis, determined from the quantity and quality of the flow shall be considered the analysis of record and shall be used to establish current billing procedures.

                  (1)  Existing uses and zoning of nearby property; 
                  (2)  The extent to which property values are diminished by the present zoning restrictions; 
                  (3)  The extent to which the destruction of property values resulting from existing zoning of the applicant's parcel promotes the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public;

                  (7)  Conformity with or divergence from the comprehensive plan. 
                  (b)  Place of hearing. The public hearings will be convened at the advertised time and place and will be presided over by the appropriate officials.

Proponents and opponents of each zoning decision or application shall have an equal minimum time period of not less than ten minutes per side for presentation of data, evidence and opinion. A designated timekeeper shall record the time expended by each speaker. 
                  (3)  Additional persons will be recognized per this procedure for the purpose of addressing additional elements of the proposed revisions or to make additional points with regard to elements already addressed, but not to rehash points already made. 
                  (d)  Appropriate notes or minutes. Appropriate notes or minutes will be recorded by the city commission and the planning commission at their respective public hearings.

Such variances may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon specific written findings by the planning commission that: 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; 
                  (2)  The application of this chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  (3)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved, and not of the making of the applicant; 
                  (4)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land, building or structure that is prohibited by this chapter;

                  (6)  The city clerk or his designee will inform the applicant as soon as practical of the public hearing dates. The planning commission will convene a public hearing on each request for variance. Public notice of the hearing will appear in a newspaper of general circulation within the city no less than 15 days or more than 45 days before the date of the official public hearing. 
                  (b)  In the event the planning commission determines not to grant a variance, or the variance request is unacceptable to city staff, either party may appeal for a final (and official) public hearing before the commission. This appeal shall be in writing, and must be filed within five days of the decision of the planning commission. All notification procedure, review, conduct of hearing and resubmittal requirements as generally contained in this chapter shall apply to a review of a variance.

                  ARTICLE III. - NONCONFORMING USES 

                  Sec. 94-85. - General purpose. 
                  Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted there exists: 
                  (1)  Lots; 
                  (2)  Structures; 
                  (3)  Uses of land and structures; and 
                  (4)  Characteristics of use. 
                  which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
                  Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter. 
                  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption of this chapter and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on; provided that the building shall be completed within one year from the date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and is not the subject of a proper enacted moratorium. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction.

                  Sec. 94-86. - Classification changes. 
                  (a)  When a district shall be changed, any then existing nonconforming use in the changed district may be continued or changed to a use of similar or higher classification, provided all other regulations governing the new use are complied with. 
                  (b)  Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued or changed to a higher classification or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use or a lower classification.

                  Sec. 94-87. - Nonconforming uses of land (or land with minor structures only). 
                  Where at the time of passage of this chapter lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding $1,000.00, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
                  (a)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter; 
                  (b)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter; 
                  (c)  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is located; and, 
                  (d)  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.

                  Sec. 94-88. - Nonconforming structures or structures and premises in combination. 
                  If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000.00 or more or of structure and premises in combination exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
                  (a)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located; 
                  (b)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building; 
                  (c)  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises may as a special exception be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the commission, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this chapter; 
                  (d)  Any structure or structure and land in combination on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed; 
                  (e)  When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises in combination is discontinued or abandoned for 60 days (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located; and 
                  (f)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction. If a nonconforming building and premises in combination suffers damage which does not exceed 50 percent of its fair market value immediately preceding such damage, the building and premises may be reconstructed, restored and reused (as before) if completed within 12 months from the time such damage occurred. 
                  (g)  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.

                  Sec. 94-89. - Repairs and maintenance. 
                  On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 50 percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
                  If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
                  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
                  Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms of this chapter (other than a change through commission action from a nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the district) shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use.

                  Sec. 94-90. - Amortization and discontinuance. 
                  There are found to be certain uses of land, buildings and structures which have an adverse effect on the carrying out of the comprehensive plan and which can reasonably be discontinued after a reasonable time irrespective of aforementioned rules as to nonconforming uses. The following uses shall be removed or made conforming within the specified amortization period. Said amortization period shall commence upon the effective date of this chapter. 
                  (a)  Fences, walls and foliage which constitute a hazard by virtue of impairing sight distances at a curve or intersection shall be made conforming within one calendar year. 
                  (b)  Outdoor advertising signs and billboards deemed a nuisance or hazard shall conform within five years. 
                  (c)  All provisions in business or industrial districts of this chapter setting forth specifications for the operation of a business or industry requiring fencing or opaque shielding shall be complied with within one calendar year. This shall include buffer zones.

                  Sec. 94-132. - Lot regulations. 
                  (a)  Substandard lots. Any residentially zoned lot which was of record at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived that does not meet the requirements of this chapter for yards or other area or open space may be utilized for single residence purposes, provided that: 
                  (1)  In the absence of the ability to connect to the wastewater treatment system due to the unavailability of city sewer connection, the lot can meet the requirements of the county health department for the installation of a septic tank. 
                  When a subdivision of land or portion thereof contains lots or parcels of land that do not conform to the lot area or lot frontage provisions of this article and such tract of land is under one ownership and has remained unimproved or undeveloped for a period of two years from the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, it shall be incumbent upon the owner of such tract to replat the tract to conform to the minimum area and frontage provisions of this article for the district in which the lands are located, in the event of a sale of any portion of the land. 
                  (b)  Lot reduction below minimum requirements prohibited. No parcel of land, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in size so that lot width or depth, front, side, or rear yard, inner or outer courts, lot area per unit, or other requirements of this chapter are not maintained. This subsection shall not apply when a portion of a lot is acquired for public use. 
                  (c)  Lot size. All lots shall conform to the area requirements set forth in the zoning districts in which they are located. Residential corner lots shall have adequate width to permit appropriate building setbacks from, and orientation to, both abutting streets. 
                  (d)  Building lines. A building line meeting the front, rear and side yard setback requirements of the zoning district in which the parcel of land is located shall be established on all lots. 
                  (e)  Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots should be avoided, except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. When allowed, a strip of land at least 20 feet in width, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the lot or line of lots abutting such traffic artery. 
                  (f)  Lot required to abut public street. No building or structure shall be erected on a lot or portion of a lot which does not abut on a public street for at least 25 feet. 
                  (g)  Access to public streets. Access to public streets shall be maintained in accordance with a minimum 25-foot frontage on a public street. 
                  (h)  Inspection permit requirements. To ensure the provisions of this chapter are complied with by the petitioner, no building, structure or site alterations shall be allowed to commence on a lot or portion of a lot before a building permit is obtained from the city. 
                  (i)  [Lots at intersections.] On lots having frontage on more than one street at an intersection, the minimum front yard requirement may be reduced to one-half the regulated distance on the portion of the lot fronting on the street or streets of less importance. However, in no case shall the setback be reduced to less than 25 feet. The minimum front yard for the portion of the lot fronting on the street of greater importance shall be provided in accordance with the provisions established by this ordinance for the district in which the lot is located. For purposes of establishing the front yard, such yard shall be designated as that having the shortest frontage on the street.

                  (c)  No livestock shall be kept or maintained in any residential zone except that for each dwelling unit the occupant may keep for his personal use of commonly accepted domestic pets (dogs and cats, etc.) so long as they are not kept or used for commercial or breeding purposes, or as to create a nuisance. No one shall keep a horse on a lot of less than five acres. No one may keep a horse in any structure or enclosure which is located less than 75 feet from the adjoining property line and 100 feet from an adjoining dwelling.

                  (1)  Attached to main dwelling. Where an accessory building is attached to the main building, a substantial part of one wall of the accessory building must be an integral part of the main building, and such accessory building must be attached to the main building in a substantial manner by a roof. Such attached accessory building shall comply in all respects with the requirements applicable to the main building. 
                  (2)  Detached from main dwelling. A detached accessory building shall not be closer than ten feet to a lot line nor should it be a habitable building. Carports projecting from the front of a house are disallowed. 
                  (3)  Height and lot coverage requirements for detached accessory building. A detached accessory building shall not exceed 15 feet in height and shall not be located in a front yard. A detached accessory building may be located in a side or rear yard but may not cover more than 20 percent of the side or rear yard. 
                  (b)  Temporary buildings. Temporary buildings may be used only in conjunction with construction work in any zoning district and shall be removed immediately upon the completion of construction. A certificate of zoning compliance must be obtained for use of a temporary building. 
                  (c)  Satellite dish antennas. Satellite dishes shall be no more than 36 inches in diameter in residential zones.

                  Sec. 94-141. - Buffer areas and screening—Variance. 
                  (a)  Purpose; when required. The use of buffer areas and screening reduces potential incompatibility between or among different uses of land in proximity to each other. Where the city determines that a proposed use of land or the granting of a variance from the requirements of this chapter would have an unfavorable impact on an adjoining use, or the granting of a permit for such use or variance, a permanent buffer area or screening will be established. 
                  (b)  Buffer area formation and maintenance. Buffer areas, when required, shall be established and permanently maintained under the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Be maintained as a planted area (or landscaped berm), using existing vegetation, or, when required, additional plantings as provided in this subsection; 
                  (2)  Be in such dimension as the city may determine necessary, but in no event less than 20 feet measured at right angles to property lines contiguous to the designated property line(s); 
                  (3)  Be landscaped with trees, shrubs, flowers, grass, stone, rocks and other landscaping materials; landscaping plants shall be composed of healthy plants which possess growth characteristics of such a nature so as to produce a dense compact planting screen of not less than six feet in height; 
                  (4)  Be free of structures other than a fence, and not be used for parking, utility easements, or drainage improvements, unless the applicant can demonstrate that these improvements are necessary; 
                  (5)  The natural topography of the land shall be preserved and natural growth shall not be disturbed beyond that which is necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin natural growth where too dense for normal growth, or to remove diseased or dangerous and decayed timbers. However, with commission approval, a slope easement may be cleared and graded where required to prevent soil erosion. This easement may cover no more than 20 percent of the required buffer area, and shall be immediately replanted upon completion of easement improvement; and 
                  (6)  Where, by reason of the topography of the land or by reason of the prior removal or lack of timber and foliage, the owner of the buffer area may be required to erect a permanent wall or fence of not less than six feet in height or screen of evergreen plantings, so designed and developed to provide visual screening. These plantings shall consist of evergreen shrubs that will, with normal growth, attain a height of six feet within three years.

                  Sec. 94-142. - Additional greenscaping/landscaping requirements. 
                  PURPOSE 
                  It is the purpose of these provisions to provide environmentally sound landscape amenities and buffers which promote a positive community image by promoting quality development, enhancing property values, providing for landscape improvements in the city and promoting orderly growth and aesthetic quality in the city. It is also the intent to promote a healthy, natural environment whenever possible by protecting and enhancing existing vegetation. 
                  Landscaping enhances a community's environmental and visual character and improves the overall quality of life. Vegetation can also improve air and water quality, reduce soil erosion, reduce noise and glare, provide habitat for wildlife, moderate the climate and enhance property values, thus protecting the health, safety and welfare of the community. 
                  However, inappropriate landscaping can degrade the quality of the natural environment by requiring excess water and pesticides, or by creating unnecessary conflicts with sewers, sidewalks and vehicle access. Thus it is important to promote environmentally sound landscaping, including the use of low-maintenance, drought-resistant and native or noninvasive plants, and to ensure that the right tree is planted in the right place. Environmentally sound landscaping also means prohibiting the use of invasive and potentially invasive species. Although well-mannered non-native species can be welcomed additions to a landscape, invasive species can cause severe economic and environmental harm (including crop damage and degradation of native habitats) and can engender significant control costs. 
                  These provisions also establishes additional standards for buffers between certain uses. Buffers between two incompatible uses minimize harmful impacts such as transmission of noise, dust and glare. Buffers can also lessen visual pollution, establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion, and thus protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community. The presence of trees and other vegetation aids in storm water management, helps to prevent erosion, improves air quality, conserves energy, provides wildlife habitat and preserves and enhances property values. 
                  Additionally, this article is intended to require the landscaping of new parking lots in order to reduce the harmful effects of wind and air turbulence, heat and noise, and the glare of motor vehicle lights; to prevent soil erosion; to provide shade; and to enhance the appearance of parking lots. 
                  DEFINITIONS 
                  For the purposes of this article, the following words are defined: 
                  Arborist: The agent(s) of the city having the primary responsibilities for administering and enforcing this Code section. 
                  Berm: An earthen mound designed to provide visual interest, screen undesirable views and/or decrease noise.

                  Woodland: A tract of land or part thereof dominated by trees but usually also containing woody shrubs, grasses and other vegetation. 
                  APPLICABILITY 
                  For parking lots of five spaces or more, the developer shall provide landscaping along the street right-of-way(s) to which the property has frontage, the parking lot perimeter and the parking lot interior as specified in this article. 
                  Developers of new, nonresidential buildings shall provide landscaping between the building and the street right(s)-of-way to which the property has frontage, as specified in this article. Buffers and screening shall also be provided in accordance with this article. 
                  No land use permit or building permit shall be issued, and it shall be unlawful to commence development or construction, until it is determined that the proposed development or building is in conformance with the provisions of the article, as applicable. 
                  LANDSCAPE ADJACENT TO STREET RIGHT-OF-WAY 
                  One of the following five planting specifications shall apply to all parking lots established after the adoption of this article. The applicant may choose but shall comply with one of the five following options for landscaping adjacent to the public right of way. The landscape requirement shall not apply to vehicle access areas and shall not include any other paved surfaces with the exception of pedestrian sidewalks or trails and areas approved for stormwater management. The topography of a particular site may necessitate the use of a combination of options along a given length of frontage. 
                  Option 1. Minimum ten-foot wide landscape strip, planted with a minimum of one shade tree and ten shrubs per 35 linear feet of street frontage, excluding driveway openings (Figure 4-5-1). 

                  Option 2 . An earth berm at least 2.5 feet higher than the finished elevation of the parking lot, with one shade tree and five shrubs for every 35 linear feet of frontage (Figure 4-5-3). 

                  Option 3. A six-foot landscaped strip with a minimum three-foot grade drop from the right-of-way to the parking lot. One shade tree and five shrubs are required for every 35 linear feet (Figure 4-5-3). 

                  Option 4. A three-foot high fence of brick, stone, or finished concrete wall, with a four-foot buffer strip, planted with a minimum of one shade tree per 35 linear feet of frontage (Figure 4-5-4). 

                  Option 5. If existing woodlands are determined by the arborist to be sufficient to meet the intent of this article, the applicant may preserve a 25-foot wide natural buffer strip to satisfy the requirements of this Code subsection (Figure 4-5-5). 

                  PARKING LOT LANDSCAPE ALONG OTHER PROPERTY LINES 
                  Along all property lines not abutting a street right-of-way, or along the perimeter of the developed portion of the lot in case the development does not extend to a property line, parking lots subject to the requirements of this subsection shall include a perimeter landscape strip at least five feet wide. The perimeter landscape strip shall not apply to interparcel access points but shall not include any other paved surfaces with the exception of pedestrian sidewalks or trails and areas approved for stormwater management. Within the perimeter landscape strip, the applicant shall install one tree and three shrubs for each 35 linear feet of property boundary along the perimeter to which this Code subsection applies, unless the Arborist approves the use of existing woodlands or other vegetation as meeting the intent of this article. See Figure 4-5-6. 

                  PARKING LOT INTERIOR LANDSCAPING 
                  Interior lot landscaping shall be required for any parking lot subject to the requirements of this article. An interior parking lot landscape island at least nine feet wide (Figure 4-5-7) and at least 150 square feet in area shall be provided for every ten spaces in each row of parking spaces abutting the perimeter or within the interior of the parking lot. Within each interior parking lot landscape island, a minimum two-inch caliper tree shall be required to be planted and maintained. 

                  LANDSCAPE BETWEEN BUILDINGS AND STREET RIGHT-OF-WAY 
                  A landscape strip shall be required along the entire building frontage of any office, institutional, commercial or industrial building located within 50 feet of a street right-of-way, between said building and the street right-of-way, except for approved pedestrian and vehicle access areas. For pedestrian retail districts or other areas where the requirements of this section may interfere with pedestrian access, a streetscape plan incorporating landscaping appropriate to the context, approved by the arborist, may satisfy this requirement. 
                  There shall be the following three options that may be used singly or in any appropriate combination to comply with this Code subsection, as proposed by the developer and approved by the arborist. 
                  Option 1. A minimum ten-foot-wide landscape strip, with a minimum of one shade tree and ten shrubs for every 35 feet of linear street frontage (Figure 4-5-8). 

                  Option 2. A strip of varying width, but with a minimum of ten feet and averaging at least 15 feet wide, with a minimum of one shade tree and five shrubs per 35 linear feet (Figure 4-5-9). 

                  Option 3. Existing woodlands at least 25 feet wide (Figure 4-5-10). 

                  BUFFERS REQUIRED 
                  Buffers for individual uses shall be provided according to the requirements of Table 4-5-3, as applicable, based on existing, adjoining uses. 
                  Table 4-5-3  Minimum Required Buffer Width 

                   
                  SCREENING AND BUFFER SPECIFICATIONS 
                  Screening shall be established within all buffers that are required by this Code, along side and rear lot lines. The arborist may require additional screening outside landscape strips and buffers that are required along side and rear lot lines, for purposes of obscuring features such as rear entrances, utility and maintenance structures, and loading facilities. Landscaping shall be used whenever possible to screen objectionable views, noises, or nuisances, such as service areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units, transformers, etc. 
                  All required screening shall consist of shrubs and/or trees but may be supplemented with walls, fences or earth berms. Screening shall be of such nature and density to screen activities on the lot from view from the normal level of a first story window on an abutting lot and shall provide year-round maximum opacity from the ground to a height of at least six feet. Trees and shrubs shall be installed to not only provide maximum opacity, but to allow for proper plant growth and maintenance. 
                  To achieve maximum opacity within buffers, the following alternatives, or combination thereof, shall be considered by the applicant and applied, subject to the approval of the arborist: 
                  (a)  Six-foot-high evergreen screening shrubs planted four (4) feet on center. 
                  (b)  Tall evergreen trees stagger-planted with branches touching ground. 
                  (c)  Combination of small shrubs planted 30 inches on center, small trees planted 30 feet on center, and large trees planted 40 feet on center. 
                  (d)  Six-foot-high masonry wall. 
                  In selecting materials and the size of plantings to be installed, the applicant and the Arborist shall consider the purpose of the landscape and the following required materials: 

                   
                  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
                  Visibility. Landscaping shall not restrict visibility of motorists or pedestrians (e.g., tall shrubs or low-lying branches of trees). 
                  Clearance. Trees must have a clear trunk at least six feet above finished grade to allow a safe clearance beneath the tree, except as otherwise provided by this Code section. 
                  Curb stops. A curb or wheelstop shall be provided along interior parking lot landscape islands, perimeter landscape strips, and landscapes adjacent to street rights-of-way, to prevent cars from encroaching on trees, shrubs, and landscapes, as approved by the Arborist. 
                  LANDSCAPE PLAN 
                  A landscaping plan approved by the arborist shall be required prior to the issuance of a land use permit or building permit to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Code. The landscape plan shall be based on an accurate boundary survey of the site or reasonable property description and shall include the following: 
                  (a)  Location and general type of existing vegetation; 
                  (b)  Existing vegetation to be saved; 
                  (c)  Methods and details for protecting existing vegetation during construction; 
                  (d)  Locations and labels for all proposed plants and a plant list or schedule showing the proposed and minimum required quantities; 
                  (e)  Location and description of other landscape improvements, such as earth berms, walls, fences, screens, sculptures, fountains, street furniture, lights, and courts or paved areas. 
                  APPROVAL OF LANDSCAPING AND OTHER MATERIALS 
                  Approval of all landscaping and other materials by the arborist shall be required. The arborist shall have broad discretion in approving the specific types of landscaping and other materials provided in the landscape requirements of this Code section. However, the following general guidance is provided and specific lists of approved species are provided in this Code: 
                  (a)  The use of native plants as landscaping materials is encouraged wherever possible. 
                  (b)  Invasive or potentially invasive plants are not permitted. However, well-mannered non-native plants are acceptable if they are not considered invasive or potentially invasive. 
                  (c)  Existing tree cover and natural vegetation shall be preserved, whenever possible, or replaced with suitable vegetation. 
                  (d)  Ground cover(s) should be used to supplement landscaping in appropriate areas to reduce the need for extensive grass lawns, which would require regular watering in drought conditions. 
                  (e)  Grass areas shall be sodded. However, if grass seed must be used, it shall be a variety suitable to the area that produces complete coverage. 
                  (f)  No artificial plants, trees, or other vegetation shall be installed. 
                  TREE PLANTING GUIDELINES 
                  (a)  [Acceptable trees.] Only healthy trees with a well-developed root system and a well-formed top, characteristic of the species, should be planted. 
                  (b)  [Compatibility.] Trees selected for planting must be compatible with the specific site conditions. 
                  (c)  [Planting times.] The ability of a species to regenerate a new root system and to become re-established should be considered. Generally, deciduous trees should be planted in the fall after leaf drop, or in early spring before bud break. There are indications that bare-root trees will re-establish more readily if planted in early spring just prior to bud break. 
                  (d)  [Depth.] Trees should not be planted deeper than they were in their former location or container. 
                  (e)  [Backfill.] Once the transplanted tree is set, the hole should be backfilled with soil of good texture and structure. Backfill material should be comprised of a mix of native soil, organic matter such as peat, and inorganic material such as pearlite or vermiculite in a 1:1:1 ratio, although a backfill with native soil alone may be adequate. 
                  (f)  [Fertilizer.] The addition of fertilizer to backfill soil can cause root injury and is therefore not recommended. If fertilizer must be added, a small amount should be used. Approximately 1.5 pounds of nitrogen per cubic yard of back fill is recommended for bare root plants, and 2.5 pounds of nitrogen per cubic yard of back fill for balled and burlapped trees. 
                  (g)  [Settling.] The backfill should be gently tamped (but not compacted) and soaked for settling. The soil should be slightly mounded to allow for settling; a ridge or dike around the perimeter of the hole can facilitate watering. 
                  (h)  Pruning. The amount of pruning necessary for newly planted trees depends upon the trees' response to planting. A decrease in leaf surface area from pruning can result in a reduction of the production of food, thus ultimately inhibiting root development. Pruning for vigor or to train young trees should therefore be delayed until after the first growing season. 
                  (i)  [Staking.] Staking should be used on newly planted trees only where determined necessary. The extent of staking will depend upon tree strength, form and condition at planting, expected wind conditions, the amount of vehicle or foot traffic and the level of followup maintenance. Staking can cause tree damage. Periodic followup inspections are required to prevent serious tree-staking problems. Staking should be removed as soon as the tree is capable of providing its own anchorage and support. 
                  (j)  [Mulching.] Mulching newly planted trees will reduce competition from weeds and moderate soil moisture and temperature extremes. 
                  (k)  [Injury, etc.] Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease or nutritional disorders. 
                  (l)  [Root defects.] Trees selected for planting must be free of root defects. 
                  LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE AND LANDSCAPE BOND 
                  The owner, occupant, tenant and respective agent of each, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance and protection of all landscaping required to be installed pursuant to this Code. Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the developer or owner shall post a performance bond or cash escrow guaranteeing all landscaping materials and work for a period of two years after approval or acceptance thereof by the city in a sum established by the Arborist. The bond will be in the amount of 100 percent of the estimated cost of replacing all of the landscaping required by these specifications, unless otherwise specified by the arborist. At the end of two years, the arborist shall make an inspection and notify the owner or developer and the bond company of any corrections to be made.

                  Sec. 94-250. - Intent. 
                  The purpose of this district is to preserve the downtown commercial district and provide locations for shopping facilities that are commonly found in the retail commercial uses of the historic downtown orientation. The CBD (central business district) would also provide for loft-style living and other residential concepts associated with a downtown city. Such facilities should be located to allow for minimal lot line requirements, but not to forsake the public safety and general welfare. In addition, the frequency and distribution patterns reflect the downtown orientation, without jeopardizing the historic significance of the central business district.

                  Sec. 94-251. - Required conditions. 
                  Retail sales, displays of merchandise, and storage must be within an appropriate enclosure (building, or structure) as specified by law or ordinance. However, the commission may grant an exception to this requirement as a conditional use where it finds that enforcement would create an unreasonable hardship. No single business activity shall occupy more than 40,000 square feet of building area. Specified residential uses will be permitted in the C-1 district as conditional uses after review and recommendation by the planning commission and a formal approval by the city commission set forth in this Code. This mixed-use environment will help preserve the historic character of the downtown area and allow for a greater degree of flexibility in dealing with existing properties.

                  The purpose of this district is to provide locations for neighborhood shopping facilities in which are found retail commercial uses which have a neighborhood orientation and which supply necessities usually requiring frequent purchasing with a minimum of consumer travel. Such facilities should be located so that their frequency and distribution patterns reflect their neighborhood orientation. In addition, such facilities should not be so large or so broad in scope of services as to attract substantial amounts of trade from outside the neighborhood commercial zone and should not be located in close proximity to other commercial areas.

                  (b)  Specified conditional uses will be permitted within the CN district after review and recommendation by the planning commission and a formal approval by the city commission. This mixed-use environment will help preserve the historic character of any existing neighborhoods and allow for a greater degree of flexibility in dealing with existing properties.

                  (a)  A "special use classification" shall be defined as a district which creates, adjacent to abutting residential, commercial or industrial zones, a certain new classification of property based upon a special use of such property, or special stipulations concerning the use of the property, since the property, because of its unique character, location or use, does not fit within the general use requirements by district, as contained in article V of this chapter. This use classification is based upon either special conditions for the use of the property, certain restrictions that will be applied to the use or other similar circumstances so that the property thereafter will be designated with the special use. As an example, an R-1 use could have a further classification of SU appended to it in that the residential single-family dwellings to be built upon the property shall be based upon lots with either additional setback requirements as those contained in the subdivision regulations, square footage use restriction or other similar restrictions that may be placed by the developer of the property; or special uses placed upon the property by the city in connection with any review and approval of zoning of the property. 
                  (b)  The use to be permitted by this designation either as a special district under this article, or as a designation within any other residential, commercial or industrial district, shall consider the following uses and matters affecting the property: 
                  (1)  The use and zoning of surrounding property. 
                  (2)  The need for a special buffer, special circumstances with regard to the zoning classification, or other special use requirements of the property based upon location, terrain, size, topography or similar criteria. 
                  (3)  The overall zoning development plan of the city as it relates to the geographical district within one square mile radius of the location of the property. 
                  (4)  Environmental conditions, uses, concerns or similar requirements. 
                  (5)  The submitted development plan, or proposed building plan of the property. 
                  (6)  Other criteria as may be established by the planning commission or building inspector of the city in a review of any requested zoning.

                  Sec. 94-385. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  Planned development zoning is of a substantially different character than other types of zoning. Because of the difference in character, special standards and procedures are hereby established to govern and guide the creation of planned development zoning districts. 
                  (b)  Planned development zoning is a privilege to be earned and not a right which can be claimed simply upon complying with all the standards established in this division. The planning commission and/or city commission may require any reasonable condition or design consideration which will promote proper development of benefit to the community. It is not intended that the commission and/or commission automatically grant the maximum use exceptions or density increases in the case of each planned development. The commission and commission shall grant only such increase or latitude which is consistent with the benefit accruing to the city as a result of the planned development. As a condition for approval, each planned development must be compatible with the character and objectives of the zoning district within which it is located, and each planned development shall be consistent with the objectives of the city comprehensive plan and all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations of the city. 
                  (c)  Some specific purposes of the planned development procedures are: 
                  (1)  To take advantage of advances in technology, architectural design and functional land use design; 
                  (2)  To permit flexibility of design in the placement, height, and uses of buildings, open spaces, circulation facilities and off-street parking areas, and to more efficiently utilize potentials of site characterized by special features of geography, topography, size and shape; and 
                  (3)  To protect floodplains from encroachment by development within the city.

                  Sec. 94-386. - Types of planned development. 
                  The types of planned development are: 
                  (1)  PD-1, planned residential development; 
                  (2)  PD-2, planned commercial (business) development; and 
                  (3)  PD-3, planned industrial development.

                  Before an application for planned development can be approved, the applicant must present evidence which clearly supports the following conclusions: 
                  (1)  The proposed development advances the general welfare of the community and the immediate vicinity; 
                  (2)  The plan is in conformity with the comprehensive plan and other applicable laws, ordinances and/or regulations; 
                  (3)  The proposed development is consistent in all respects with the purpose and intent of this chapter; 
                  (4)  The site will be accessible from public roads that are adequate to carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them by the proposed development, and the streets and driveways on the site of the proposed development will be adequate to serve the residents or occupants of the proposed development; 
                  (5)  The development will not impose an undue burden on public services and facilities, such as fire and police protection; 
                  (6)  The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas, walks, lighting, and appurtenant facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding land uses, and any part of a planned development not used for structures, parking and loading areas, or accessways shall be landscaped or otherwise improved. The height of buildings shall be compatible with surrounding land uses as well as the general characteristics of the area to be developed and the surrounding area and acceptable to the criteria for height restrictions established by this chapter and/or applicable fire regulations; 
                  (7)  Natural features such as watercourses, trees and rock outcrops will be preserved, to the degree possible, so that they can be incorporated into the layout to enhance the overall design of the planned development; and 
                  (8)  The planned development can be substantially completed within the period of time specified in the schedule of development submitted by the developer.

                  All of the land in a planned unit development shall be owned initially by a person or joint tenants or tenants in common. Individual properties in a planned unit development may be sold after a plat has been recorded, with the properties subject to private deed covenants that assure the continuance of the planned unit development as originally approved and developed. If the applicant of a planned development is not intending to develop the property but instead plans to sell all or a portion of the area designated as planned development or otherwise to allow a third party to develop the property, the city may reduce the standards of site approval if site specifications are not yet available with the understanding that any future purchasers or developers will have to complete the entire approval process once plans for improvement are available.

                  (a)  Preapplication conference. Prior to filing a formal application for approval of a planned development, the developer shall request a preapplication conference with the planning commission, to include city staff and such persons as determined by the city that may provide adequate representation for the city. The purpose of such conference is to allow the developer to present a general concept of his proposed development prior to the preparation of detailed plans. For this purpose, the presentation shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
                  (1)  Written letter of intent from the developer establishing his intentions as to development of the land. 
                  (2)  Topographic survey and location map. 
                  (3)  Sketch plans and conceptual objectives regarding land use pattern, structure location and type, street and lot arrangement and tentative lot sizes. 
                  (4)  Tentative proposals regarding water supply, sewage disposal, surface drainage, street improvements and flood control measures. 
                  (5)  The planning commission shall then instruct the developer to file an application and advise the developer to familiarize himself with the city zoning requirements, comprehensive plan, and all other development regulations affecting the proposed development. A copy of this division shall be made available upon request. 
                  (b)  Preliminary plan. Seven copies of the preliminary plan of the planned development and the application shall be filed with the zoning officer, who shall, in turn, forward them to the planning commission for consideration. The required procedure for consideration and approval of the preliminary plan shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  An application for zoning amendment shall be secured from the zoning officer. The completed application shall be filed with the zoning officer accompanied by other subdivision requirements as specified in this Code. 
                  (2)  The planning commission shall study materials received and confer with other agencies, as appropriate, and city officials to determine general acceptability of the proposal as submitted. In the course of such preliminary consideration, the planning commission may request and the applicant shall supply additional material needed to make specific determinations. 
                  (3)  Following such study, the planning commission shall hold a conference or conferences with the applicant to discuss desirable changes in the first or succeeding drafts of the preliminary development plan and report. 
                  (4)  Recommendations of the planning commission to the applicant shall be in writing, and following any such conference, agreements between the applicant and the planning commission as to changes in the preliminary plan or other matters are to be recorded and acknowledged by the planning commission and the applicant in writing. Items on which no agreement is reached or on which there is specific disagreement shall be recorded, and the applicant may place in the record his reasons for any disagreement. 
                  (5)  Upon the occurrence of either of the following conditions, the planning commission will schedule the proposed plan for a public hearing: 
                  a.  When the preliminary development plan has been approved in principal (as a whole or with reservations specifically indicated); or 
                  b.  When the applicant indicates in writing that no further negotiations with the planning commission are desired before proceeding. 
                  Regardless of which subsection of this section is satisfied, the planning commission must make its recommendations to the city commission within 60 days from the submission of the preliminary plan application. The planning commission shall make its recommendations to the city commission. Such recommendations shall indicate approval, approval with specific reservations or disapproval with reasons. 
                  (4)  The city commission shall then schedule a public hearing on the matter. Within 60 days from the public hearing for the preliminary plan and respective planned development zone designation, the city commission shall approve the proposal outright, approve the proposal subject to conditions, or deny the proposal. Commission approval shall be by ordinance. If conditions are attached to commission approval, there shall be no change in the zoning map until such conditions are formally accepted in writing by the developer. When approved, the area of land proposed for development shall be designated PD-1, PD-2, PD-3 or PD-4 and shall be used only in accordance with the uses and densities shown on the planned development approved and adopted preliminary plan. 
                  (c)  Approval and recording of final development plan. 
                  (1)  The purpose of such recording is to designate with particularity the land subdivided into conventional lots, as well as the dimension of other lands not so treated, into common open areas and building areas, and also to define each building site as well as the use of the land in general. 
                  (2)  The approval and recording of the final development plan may be accomplished in stages if the stages have been specified in the construction schedule approved with the preliminary plan. 
                  a.  Upon the designation of the planned development district by commission, the final development plan shall be presented and approved in a form suitable for recording with the county clerk's office. 
                  b.  The proposed plat (the final development plan in a form suitable for rezoning) shall then be forwarded to the planning commission for review and, if approved, shall be forwarded to the city manager, who shall make appropriate arrangement with the applicant to ensure the accomplishment of public improvements at the applicant's expense and as provided by this Code. The city manager shall consult with the commission concerning any land to be publicly or commonly owned and shall arrange for the necessary legal deeds. 
                  c.  The final plat shall be presented by the city manager and the proposed developers to the city commission for formal approval and recording. 
                  d.  The approved record plat shall then be submitted to the county clerk's office for recording within six months after approval by commission. 
                  e.  No final development plan within the corporate limits of the city shall be so recorded unless it shall have the approval of commission, as indicated by the signatures of the chairman and the city clerk, inscribed thereon. 
                  (d)  Zoning permit. No zoning permit shall be issued by the zoning officer until the final development plan has been approved and duly recorded. 
                  (e)  Certificate of zoning compliance. 
                  (1)  The zoning officer shall issue no certificate of zoning compliance until all utilities have been accepted by the city in accordance with the final development plan. 
                  (2)  If all utilities, including roadways, have not been accepted by the city, the zoning officer may issue a temporary certificate of zoning compliance upon certification by the city manager that the existing public utilities are functionally acceptable and adequate for the use of the premises. Should the city manager find, while the temporary certificate of zoning compliance is in force, that the existing utilities are no longer functionally acceptable and adequate, the city manager may order the cancellation of the temporary certificate of zoning compliance and direct the developer to vacate the premises of occupants. 
                  (3)  The temporary certificate of zoning compliance remains in effect until all utilities, including roadways, are accepted by the city, at which time the zoning officer will issue a permanent certificate of occupancy. 
                  (f)  Changes in the planned development. 
                  (1)  A planned development shall be developed only according to the approved and recorded final plan, and all recorded amendments shall be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees and assignees and shall limit and control the use of premises (including the general internal use of buildings and structures) and location of structures in the planned development as set forth therein. Any deviation from the approved and recorded final plan must have planning commission review and city commission approval in writing and as an amendment to the plan. 
                  (2)  All requested changes or revisions to an approval and recorded final plat must be made to the planning commission. The commission must determine if these proposed changes are deemed "minor" or "major" plan revisions, as hereinafter defined. For purposes of this chapter, these terms are defined as follows: 
                  a.  Major changes. Changes which alter the concept or intent of the planned development, including, but not limited to, increases in the number of units per acre; change in location or amount on nonresidential land use; more than ten percent modification in proportion of housing types; reductions of proposed open space; significant redesign of roadways, utilities or drainage may be approved only by submission of a new preliminary plan and supporting data, and following the "preliminary approval" steps and subsequent amendment of the final planned development plan. 
                  b.  Minor changes. A minor change is any change not defined as a major change. The city zoning officer and the planning commission may jointly approve minor changes in the planned development which do not change the concept or intent of the development without repeating the "preliminary approval" steps. The zoning officer shall enter in detail all minor changes on the official final development plan on record with the city. 
                  (g)  Schedule of construction. A modification of the schedule may be approved by the city commission if the developer shall present satisfactory evidence of reasonable effort toward meeting the initial schedule and justification for the modification. If construction falls more than one year behind schedule, as determined by the city engineer, and the developer fails to justify the delay to the commission's satisfaction, commission may proceed to complete all or any part of such improvements and recover the costs thereof by laying claim to the guarantee specified in section 94-394. 
                  (h)  Effect of denial of a planned development. 
                  (1)  If an application for a planned development is denied wholly or partly, then for a period of one year from the date of submission thereof, the planning commission need not consider any resubmission therefore. 
                  (2)  If a preliminary development plan is approved and the final development plan is thereafter disapproved, the applicant, or his successor in interest, may at any time submit one or more new versions of the final development plan, so long as the new versions are in full compliance with the approved preliminary development plan, including any conditions attached to said plan.

This district is intended to provide flexibility in the arrangement and design of residential dwellings, based upon a unified development plan conceived and carried out for an entire area. Within this district, appropriate and reasonable population density is maintained while a variety of dwelling unit types is encouraged. Natural features such as topography, trees and drainageways are encouraged to remain in their natural state to the degree possible. Such developments are generally characterized by a significant proportion of usable open space and a unified design concept with particular attention devoted to the periphery of the development, the overall objective being the compatibility of the development with its surroundings. 
                  (b)  Permitted uses. 
                  (1)  Permitted uses are those included as permitted, conditional and accessory uses in all residential zones, as established by this chapter. 
                  (2)  Convenience establishments as conditional uses are those established as necessary for the proper development of the community and to be so located, designated and operated to serve primarily the needs of the persons within the planned development plot. Uses shall be generally limited to those uses permitted in the C-1 and C-2 districts, with no direct access or advertising signs for such uses to be visible from the exterior of the development. Such convenience establishments and their parking areas shall not occupy more than five percent of the total area of the development. No separate building or structure designed or intended to be used, in whole or in part, for business purposes shall be constructed within a residential planned development until not less than 30 percent of the dwelling units proposed in the development plan are certified for occupancy. 
                  (c)  Area requirements. The minimum land area required for a planned residential development shall be five acres. This area requirement may be reduced at the discretion of the planning commission and city commission if it can be demonstrated that a waiver is necessary to achieve an improved site design and that surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities will not be adversely affected. 
                  (d)  Density requirements. Any combination or cluster of housing units is permitted, provided that the average lot area per family or dwelling unit contained in the site, exclusive of the area of street rights-of-way, parking areas and commercial areas, must be at least 80 percent of the average lot area per family required in the surrounding nonagricultural districts. This density requirement may be varied at the discretion of the planning commission and city commission if it can be demonstrated that a waiver is necessary to achieve an improved site design and that surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities will not be adversely affected. 
                  (e)  Site design. 
                  (1)  All housing shall be sited to preserve privacy and to ensure natural light. 
                  (2)  Lot widths may be varied to permit a mixture of structural designs. Varied setback is encouraged. 
                  (3)  Where feasible, housing units should be situated to abut common open space or similar areas. A clustering of dwellings is encouraged. 
                  (f)  Structure spacing. A minimum of 20 feet shall be maintained between principal structures. 
                  (g)  Length. There shall be no continuous structure of townhouses, attached dwellings or apartments containing more than 12 dwelling units on ground floor level. 
                  (h)  Height. The building height of any residential structure within a planned development shall not exceed 45 feet or three and one-half stories. However, the planning commission may grant an exception if it is demonstrated that additional height can be achieved with concurrent expansion of suitable open space to protect adjacent structures from adverse reduction of light and air. 
                  (i)  Setback and screening. A minimum setback of 50 feet shall be provided along the entire perimeter of the development and retained in natural woods, or be suitably landscaped with grass and/or ground cover, shrubs and trees. Projects located adjacent to commercial or industrially zoned areas shall provide suitable screening to the residential development as adjudged by the planning commission. Screening shall not obscure traffic visibility within 50 feet of an intersection. 
                  (j)  Common open space. 
                  (1)  A minimum of 25 percent of the total land in any planned residential development shall be reserved for permanent common open space and recreational facilities for the residents or users of the area being developed. In extreme topographical conditions, at the discretion of the planning commission, this requirement may be reduced. 
                  (2)  Only area having minimum dimensions of 50 feet by 100 feet shall qualify for computation as usable open space. 
                  (k)  Parking requirements. A minimum of two spaces per unit, with two extra spaces for each building with multiple units. 
                  (l)  Signs. Permitted sizes and locations of signs within the PD-1 development shall be in compliance with the standards established in article III of chapter 5. 
                  (m)  Utilities. All utilities, including electric, telephone, gas, water and sewer lines must be buried, except when deemed unfeasible as determined by the city engineer.

A landscaped mound adequate to provide screening may be substituted for hedge or shrubs. 
                  (3)  In no case shall screening be placed within 50 feet of a curb cut or intersection. 
                  (4)  Vehicular access through such landscaped strip when leading from residential areas shall be permitted only for convenience of residents of adjoining residential areas, and not designed for use by the general public. 
                  (g)  Parking requirements. Standards for parking shall be as established in article V, division 3. 
                  (h)  Loading and unloading areas. Standards for loading and unloading areas shall be as established in article V, division 3. 
                  (i)  Signs. Standards for the sizes and locations of signs shall be as established in article III of chapter 5. 
                  (j)  Utilities. Wherever possible, utilities shall be housed in structures compatible with the development so as not to detract from the overall aesthetic design.

The code of the City of Cedartown shall stand amended as to Chapter 94 thereof entitled "Zoning." In Article 7, entitled "Administration and Enforcement", division 3 of Article 7 involves the board of adjustments and section 94-262 creates officers and meeting requirements of the board. These sections are hereby abolished and deleted. 
                  Section 2. All references in the zoning ordinance, (Chapter 94) or any other areas of the code of ordinances of the City of Cedartown to the "Board of Adjustments" are deleted and abolished, it being the intention of this ordinance to allow the planning commission, already created by the city, to act in connection with all matters which could formerly have been construed to be within the jurisdiction and responsibility of the board of adjustments. Hereafter, any and all jurisdiction and authority previously vested in the board of adjustments, shall after the effective date of this ordinance, be fully and conclusively vested in the Cedartown Planning Commission. 
                  Section 3. Further evidencing the intention of the city commission as set forth in section 2 hereof, section 94-263, 94-264, and all matters concerning appeals and hearings as contained thereafter shall be incorporated into, and be vested fully, with the Cedartown Planning Commission to use said procedures, hearings and standards as might be applicable in its deliberations of handling all appeals to be conducted under the Code of the City of Cedartown for matters of zoning, building enforcement, variances, and related powers and duties. 
                  Section 4. In accomplishing the intention of the commission, the codifiers of the city code, being Municipal Code Corporation, may merge, consolidate, or delete duplicating sections for hearings and appeals as might exist within Divisions 2 and 3 of Article VII. However, the powers and duties of administrative review, special exceptions and variances as contained in Section 94-263 shall be saved from repeal, and shall be fully vested in the planning commission, together with the standards for decisions on zoning matters as contained in section 94-264 of the code, which are also saved from repeal."

                  (6)  Consider the effect of the proposed change upon the logical, efficient and economical extension of public services and facilities such as water, sewers, police and fire protection and public schools, and assure adequate arrangements for sanitation in specific instances. 
                  (7)  Safeguard the development of highway frontage insofar as possible so as to limit the total number of access points and encourage the frontage of buildings parallel to marginal roads or on roads perpendicular to the highway. 
                  (8)  Consider the suitability of the proposed location for an industrial or commercial use with respect to probable effects upon highway traffic, and assure adequate access arrangements in order to protect major highways from undue congestion and hazard. 
                  (9)  Ascertain the adequacy of sanitation and public safety provisions, where applicable, and require a certificate of adequacy of sewage and water facilities from the department of health of the county in any case required in this chapter as deemed advisable. 
                  (10)  Impose such conditions, in addition to those required, as are necessary to assure that the general purpose and intent of this chapter are complied with, which conditions may include, but are not limited to, harmonious design of buildings, planting and its maintenance as a sight and sound screen, and the minimizing of noxious, offensive or hazardous elements.

                  This article is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the city, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the city so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the city as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this article shall: 
                  (a)  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the city; 
                  (b)  Protect the city's structures and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities; 
                  (c)  Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
                  (d)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennas failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas; 
                  (e)  Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; 
                  (f)  Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and 
                  (g)  Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.

                  Sec. 94-638. - Placement of telecommunications facilities by zoning district. 
                  (a)  In light industrial (IND-L) and heavy industrial (IND-G) zoning districts, micro and macro telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use by right. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least one user are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 80 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least two users are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 100 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least three users are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 120 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector. 
                  (b)  No telecommunications facilities shall be permitted in any residential areas. 
                  (c)  Telecommunications facilities outside the guidelines listed above may only be built after approval of a variance granted by the building inspector. 
                  (Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08) 
                  Sec. 94-639. - Colocation; preferred and disfavored location sites. 
                  (a)  [Parameters.] All applicants shall make a reasonable attempt to colocate on existing towers, buildings, or other tall structures. Furthermore, applicants shall be willing to allow other uses to colocate on the proposed tower site in the future, subject to engineering and feasibility factors, frequency considerations, and proper compensation from the additional user. Such compensation shall be determined from average lease rates paid by the applicant for comparable colocation sites in Polk County and contiguous counties, to be provided by the applicant. Such information shall, however, remain confidential and shall not be disclosed by any city official. 
                  (b)  Preferred location sites. 
                  (1)  Co-location sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site, provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this article and co-location sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the building inspector or the governing authority to be visually obtrusive. 
                  (2)  Publicly-used structures. Publicly-used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly-used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly-used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches. 
                  (3)  Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roof line can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility. 
                  (4)  Mixed use buildings in high density districts. Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites. 
                  (c)  Disfavored location sites. Any single-family, multifamily, or neighborhood commercial structure or site shall be disfavored sites for the location of telecommunications facilities.

                  Sec. 94-640. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities. 
                  (a)  General requirements for all telecommunications facilities. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this article. 
                  (1)  Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the building inspector, within 30 days after the inspection. Failure to provide said reports could result in revocation of any permits or licenses previously granted to the owner by the city. 
                  (2)  Regulatory compliance. 
                  a.  All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 
                  b.  Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months to the building inspector. Failure to provide this information could result in revocation of any permit or license previously granted to the owner by the city. 
                  (3)  Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. 
                  (4)  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the building inspector may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  (5)  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. 
                  (6)  Visual impact. 
                  a.  Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background. 
                  c.  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. 
                  d.  Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic structures as designated by the commission or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  e.  Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view, made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures, or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained by the owner of the telecommunications facility. 
                  (7)  Landscaping. 
                  a.  Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property, to the extent feasible. 
                  b.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing any existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that which is removed. 
                  c.  The building inspector may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived in the discretion of the building inspector. 
                  (8)  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street. 
                  (9)  Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
                  a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility. 
                  b.  Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 
                  (10)  Lot size and setbacks. 
                  a.  The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities, provided however, that the building inspector may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby. 
                  1.  Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure. 
                  2.  Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
                  3.  Telecommunications facilities must be setback from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on an engineer's analysis. 
                  b.  For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact and said placement is approved by the building inspector. 
                  (b)  Additional requirements for towers. 
                  (1)  Site location and development shall preserve the existing character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zoning district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. 
                  (2)  Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 
                  (3)  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (4)  Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable. 
                  (5)  When a tower is adjacent to a residential use and located on the ground, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to its total height. 
                  (6)  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district. 
                  (7)  Towers shall not be placed where they will negatively affect historic districts or buildings as designated by the commission or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter. 
                  (8)  Towers shall be enclosed by opaque or solid decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access. 
                  (9)  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design, landscape, and placement requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
                  (10)  The building inspector shall have the discretion to waive the requirements of this subsection where exact compliance would interfere with the function or purpose of a tower, or where compliance would place an unreasonable burden on an owner.

                  (3)  Additional information requirements for towers. 
                  a.  If the proposed site is zoned residential or C-1, C-2, or C-N, and there are alternative sites in IND-L or IND-G, applicants must justify why those alternate sites have not been proposed. The building inspector will review with special care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The building inspector shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site. 
                  b.  Applicants must identify all existing towers and all towers for which there are applications currently on file with the building inspector. Applicants must provide evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna. If colocation on any such towers would result in less visual impact than the visual impact of the proposed tower, applicants must justify why such colocation is not being proposed. If colocation on any such tower would increase negative visual impact, then the applicant must so state and demonstrate. The building inspector will review with special care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The building inspector shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site. 
                  c.  In all zones, applicants must demonstrate that they cannot provide personal wireless communication service without the use of a telecommunications tower. 
                  d.  The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number and types of antennas. The applicant shall provide a drawing for each tower showing existing and proposed antennas locations. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The building inspector shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means. 
                  e.  The applicant must provide a utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power lines impacting the proposed tower site. 
                  (4)  Other information requested by building inspector. The applicant must provide any other information which may be requested by the building inspector to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed telecommunications facility. 
                  (b)  Expedited review for building permits only. When a telecommunications facility will be a use as of right pursuant to sections 94-360 and 94-375 and requires only a building permit and design review before it may be erected, the building inspector will attempt to expedite review of the application and render a decision on the application within 15 business days after receipt of a complete application. 
                  (c)  Special use permits. 
                  (1)  A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the building inspector and handled in accordance with the special use permit provision of sections 94-360 and 94-375 of the Municipal Code. The planning commission may issue a special use permit under this section provided it shall have determined that all of the requirements of sections 94-360 and 94-375 have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties. 
                  (2)  In granting a special use permit, the planning commission may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties. 
                  (d)  Variances.

If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed.

                  c.  Nonconforming signs which have been allowed to deteriorate so as to constitute either an aesthetic nuisance or a safety hazard are subject to removal pursuant to section 94-715.

                  d.  Nonconforming signs which have been abandoned shall be removed in their entirety by the record owner of the building or the person who obtained the sign license, whichever owns the sign or portion thereof, within 90 days after the business using the sign closes or ceases to operate on the premises where the sign is located. However, if the building owner can produce evidence to the building inspector that a new tenant intends to erect a conforming sign using some portion of the sign support or framework within 180 days after the previous business has closed or ceased to operate, that portion may remain.

                  (b)  New zoning districts: If a new zoning district is created after the adoption of this article, no signs shall be permitted therein until this ordinance shall be amended to include such district.

                  a.  Adjacent to Highway 27 north of the intersection with North Main Street; and 
                  b.  Adjacent to North Main Street between John Hand Road on the north and East Avenue on the south. 
                  (2)  No billboard sign shall be located within 500 feet of another billboard sign on the same side of the adjacent roadway. 
                  (3)  Billboard signs shall not exceed a height of 35 feet above the crown of the adjacent roadway. 
                  (4)  New billboard signs may utilize multiple message technology to the extent allowed by Georgia law (O.C.G.A. § 32-6-70 et seq.). 
                  (5)  Billboard signs shall be freestanding ground-mounted signs on a single pole. The pole shall be setback at least ten feet from, and no part of the sign shall overhang, the right-of-way. 
                  (6)  Billboard signs require a permit to be erected. All applications for billboards pending at the time this section is adopted shall be processed in the order in which they were received. 
                  (7)  After the billboards allowed hereunder have been permitted, new billboards shall only be permitted as a relocation of an existing billboard adjacent to the approved corridors to another lawful site within the approved corridors. 
                  (Ord. No. 22-2002, §§ 1, 2, 12-9-02; Ord. No. 11-2013, § 4, 12-9-13) 
                  Sec. 94-709. - Nonconforming signs. 
                  (a)  Signs lawfully existing on the effective date of this article, which do not conform to the provisions of this article shall be deemed to be legal nonconforming "grandfathered" signs and may remain, except as otherwise specifically qualified in this article. Such signs shall not be enlarged, extended, structurally reconstructed, replaced or altered in any manner; except a sign face may be changed so long as the new sign face does not increase either height or sign area. This provision shall not have the effect of excusing any violation of any other ordinance, nor shall it permit the continued existence of any unsafe sign or any sign that is not in good state of repair. 
                  (b)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent keeping in good repair a nonconforming sign. No repairs other than minor maintenance and upkeep of nonconforming signs shall be permitted to make the sign comply with the requirements of this article. A nonconforming sign which has been declared by the city to be unsafe because of its physical condition shall not be repaired, rebuilt or restored unless such repair or restoration will result in a sign which conforms to all applicable provisions of this article. 
                  (c)  A nonconforming sign shall not be moved or otherwise relocated for any distance on the same lot or to another lot unless such change in location will make the sign conform to the provisions of this article, and meet permit requirements of this article. 
                  (d)  If a nonconforming sign is removed or the use of the sign in discontinued for any period of time, except for normal maintenance and repair, as defined in this article, or for maintenance of a building if such sign is attached to a building, the subsequent erection of a sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
                  (e)  A nonconforming sign which is changed to or replaced by a conforming sign shall no longer be deemed nonconforming, and thereafter such sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
                  (f)  Policy statement: As a consequence, when a nonconforming sign is destroyed or toppled by an act of God, weather, or whatever other means, this shall not constitute a sufficient reason to grant a variance to re-erect the nonconforming sign.

                  Sec. 94-710. - Interpretation, construction and severability. 
                  (a)  Interpretation: The words used in this article in the present tense shall include the future. Singular words include the plural, and plural words include the singular. For the sake of brevity, masculine and feminine pronouns shall be mutually inclusive and shall also include the neuter (i.e. corporations). Sub-headings and/or examples are inserted for the convenience of the reader and shall not operate to limit the effect of any provision. 
                  (b)  Construction: The provisions of all other applicable city, state and federal laws shall apply. This article shall not be construed to create a right to maintain a sign in violation of any other law, in violation of any protective covenant or in violation of the property rights or other rights of any person or entity. In the event that any provision of this article regulates the same activity, conduct or any aspect of signage that is also regulated by the city, state, or federal law, then the provisions of this article are in genuine conflict with any state or federal law or requirement, the conflict shall be resolved in accordance with the state of federal standard which apply, unless the city's local enforcement is authorized by law in which event the city's standard and regulations shall apply. 
                  (c)  Severability: The provisions, sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases and terms of this article are severable. In the event that any portion or any specific application of this article is held to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such invalidity shall not effect the other portions or other applications of this article.

                  Sec. 94-711. - Permits generally. 
                  (a)  Except as otherwise provided herein, no sign shall be used, constructed, maintained, located, replaced, expanded or relocated unless a sign permit has been issued by the city. 
                  (b)  A new sign permit shall be required for any structural alterations, other than normal maintenance and repair as defined in this article. 
                  (c)  No permit issued for a sign under the provisions of this article shall be deemed to constitute permission or authorization to maintain any sign that violates the provisions of this article, any other article, state law or federal law. 
                  (d)  Any sign requiring a permit for which a permit has not been secured shall be removed immediately. Removal shall be the joint and severable responsibility of the sign owner, the sign erector and any party that procured or consented to the erection of the sign.

                  Sec. 94-712. - Permit application. 
                  (a)  Who may apply: Permits shall be issued only to: 
                  (1)  The owner of the real property where the sign is to be located; 
                  (2)  A lessee who has the right to install or maintain a sign on the real property where the sign is to be located; with the written permission of the property owners, which statement of permission shall be attached to the above permit application. 
                  (3)  The erector of the sign, provided the erector has permission under (1) or (2) above. 
                  An applicant that is a lessee shall produce a copy of the lease or written statement from the owner of the property that the applicant has the right to maintain a sign on the property. Any person engaged in the business of erecting signs shall produce a copy of a current occupational tax certificate and proof of insurance or bond as required by the bond insurance section of this article, together with written permission to erect the signage under (1) or (2) above. 
                  (b)  Application: Application for a sign permit shall be filed with the city on forms furnished by the city. The application for a permit shall contain the identification and address of the property on which the sign is to be erected; the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the sign owner, sign erector, property owner, lessee (if applicable) and the agent making the application (if applicable); the type of sign as classified by this article; and such other pertinent information as the city may require to insure compliance with the provisions of this article and other applicable ordinances of the city. The city may require that the application be accompanied by two copies of the following; site plans showing location of structures upon the property on which the sign is to be located and the location of the sign in relation to the structures, property lines, public right-of-way, and other signs; plans, specifications and structural details showing the type and manner of construction, attachment to buildings or in ground erection; and a visual representation of the completed sign. The city may require said plans to bear the signature and seal of a registered land surveyor, professional engineer, architect or land planner. Each application shall include a signed statement from the landowner or processor of the property giving consent to entry into the property for the purpose of inspection, and enforcement of this article. If classification of the road on which the property fronts is of importance to the permit process, the city may require the applicant to submit certified documents from the Georgia Department of Transportation or the United States Department of Transportation or their successors regarding the classification of the road. 
                  (c)  Processing of application: Upon receipt of a properly completed application for a sign as permitted under the provisions of this article, the city through its enforcement personnel, shall examine and process the application within a reasonable amount of time. Though a longer period of time may be reasonable under the circumstances of the case, 15 business days shall be considered a reasonable amount of time in most cases. A permit may be denied if the applicant landowner or lessee is presently maintaining any sign in violation of this article. 
                  (d)  Procedure upon denial: Upon denial of the application of a permit, the applicant shall be given written notice stating the reason(s) for the denial within 15 days of the decision to deny the permit. Appeal from such denial may be taken to the planning and zoning commission. 
                  (Ord. No. 22-2002, §§ 1, 2, 12-9-02) 
                  Sec. 94-713. - Variances. 
                  (a)  The planning commission may, upon appeal from a denial of a permit which is required under this article, in specific cases, grant such variances from the terms of this article as will not be contrary to the public interest. In any instance where a person has been denied a sign permit, an appeal must be made to the planning commission. The appeal must be filed within ten days of the decision denying a sign permit. 
                  (b)  To authorize a variance in connection with any appeal, due to special conditions, there must be a showing that a literal enforcement of the provisions of this article will, in the individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship. The existence of the nonconforming use of neighboring signs in the same district, or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts, shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance. Such variance may be granted in the individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the planning commission that all of the following conditions exist: 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question, that make the literal enforcement of the sign ordinance, placement of a sign, or other location issues, impossible to comply with due to the size, shape or typography of the property, or building or other area where the sign is to be affixed; and 
                  (2)  The application of the regulation, ordinance provision or other limitation to this particular site would create an unnecessary hardship; and 
                  (3)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular property, building, and/or location of the sign; and 
                  (4)  Granting the variance would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the general purpose and intent of this article; provided however, that no variance may be granted for a use of a sign, or a particular structure of the sign, which is absolutely prohibited by the article. 
                  (c)  Any applicant who is aggrieved or otherwise dissatisfied with the decision of the planning commission as to his or her application for a variance shall have the right to appeal the planning commission's decision to the City Commission of the City of Cedartown. Such appeal must be filed in writing within ten days of the planning commission's action on a requested variance. Decisions of the Cedartown City Commission concerning a requested variance shall be final, subject to any other legal remedies an aggrieved party may have. 
                  (d)  Requests for variances regarding any part of this article or enforcement thereof shall specifically include all reasons why the application should be granted. 
                  (e)  Variance procedures shall apply both to signs which are nonconforming as of the effective date of this article and to new signs erected thereafter. 
                  (f)  Reserved.

                  151 to 200 sq. ft. of sign area ..... 200.00 
                  201 to 300 sq. ft. of sign area ..... 300.00 
                  301 to 378 sq. ft. of sign area ..... 400.00

                  (g)  Removal of temporary signs: Upon adoption of this article, any temporary sign, portable display sign or device included in this article shall be removed or made to conform to the provisions of this article within 60 days of the date of notification by the building official and/or his designee of his designee.

                  (h)  Unsafe or unsecure signs or other advertising structures prohibited; removal: If the building inspector shall find that any sign or other advertising structure regulated herein is unsafe or unsecure, is a menace to the public, is abandoned or maintained in a dilapidated condition or has been constructed or erected or is being maintained in violation of the provisions of this article, written notice shall be given to the permittee or property owner thereof. If the permittee or property owner fails to remove or alter the sign or advertising structure so as to comply with the standards herein set forth within a reasonable time specified in such notice, such sign or other advertising structure may be removed or altered in order to comply with requirements of this article through enforcement by the building inspector; any expense incidental to such removal or alteration shall be charged to the owner of the property upon which the sign is located and shall constitute a lien upon the property. 
                  (i)  Disposal of signs—Cost: Any sign removed by the building official and/or his designee pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city.

The costs of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sign's removal. 
                  When it is determined by the building official and/or his designee that said sign would cause an imminent danger to the public safety, and contact cannot by made with a sign owner or building owner, no written notice shall have to be served.

In the event a sign is not removed after receipt of a removal order by the owner of such sign or property, enforcement personnel may institute legal proceedings hereunder against the property owner, sign owner, lessee, sign erector, or a combination of the above. 
                  (k)  Civil actions: The enforcement personnel or any individual or entity whose property interests are directly affected may bring a civil action in Municipal Court or Polk Superior Court to seek injunctive and other relief to enforce this article.
