PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Screven County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Rick Jordan, County Manager, and Mr. R.

Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code and are considered "Omitted." 
                  By adding to this table with each supplement, users of this County Code will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

               Editor's note— Printed herein are selected substantive provisions from the acts of the state general assembly which amended 1915 Ga. Laws, page 345 relating to the creation of a board of commissioners as the governing authority in the county. Archaic and obsolete provisions on such subjects as chain gangs as well as provisions rendered inapplicable by constitutional and statutory home rule considerations have been omitted editorially. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes have been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

               (h)  Successors to members elected under subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be elected at the statewide general election next preceding the expiration of such terms of office and shall take office on January 1 following their election for terms of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified. 
               (i)  Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they existed on January 1, 2002, shall continue to be designated as Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively, but as newly described under this Act, and, on and after the effective date of this Act, such members of the board serving from those former commissioner districts shall be deemed to be serving from and representing their respective districts as newly described under this Act.

                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles.

                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

Unless otherwise provided, each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate and repeat violation.

                  (c)  A violation of a county ordinance or resolution by any officer, agent, or other person acting for or employed by any corporation or unincorporated association or organization, while acting within the scope of his office or employment, shall in every case also be deemed to be a violation by such corporation, association, or organization. Further, any officer, agent, or other person acting for or employed by any corporation or unincorporated association or organization shall be subject and liable to punishment as well as such corporation or unincorporated association or organization for the violation by it of any provisions of the ordinances or resolutions of the county, where such violation was the act or omission, or the result of the act, omission, or order, or any such person.

                  ARTICLE II. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 

                  Sec. 10-31. - Purpose and findings. 
                  a)  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the unincorporated areas of Screven County, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the county. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect or this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
                  b)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community, in findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. 501 U.S. 560 (1991), City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000), and the experience of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana; Athens-Clarke County, Georgia; Marietta, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; Warner Robins, Georgia; Rome, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; and Smyrna, Georgia; which experiences the board of commissioners believes are relevant to the issues faced by Screven County, Georgia, the board of commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the board of commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood; increased expenditures for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order; increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described; and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or partially nude conduct in establishments affects the public welfare; and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that allow and/or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, this chapter is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted.

                  b.  Issuing certificate of occupancy. Upon satisfactory completion of construction of a building or structure and installation of electrical, gas, mechanical and plumbing systems in accordance with the construction codes, reviewed plans and specifications, and after the final inspection, the building official shall issue a certificate of occupancy stating the nature of the occupancy permitted, the number of persons for each floor when limited by law, and the allowable load per square foot for each floor in accordance with the provisions of the construction codes.

                  (1)  Occupancy. An existing or new building shall not be occupied for any purpose, which will cause the floors thereof to be loaded beyond their safe capacity. The building official may permit occupancy of a building for mercantile, commercial or industrial purposes, by a specific business, when he is satisfied that such capacity will not thereby be exceeded. 
                  (2)  Storage and factory-industrial occupancies. It shall be the responsibility of the owner, agent, proprietor or occupant of group S and group F occupancies, or any occupancy where excessive floor loading is likely to occur, to employ a competent architect or engineer in computing the safe load capacity. All such computations shall be accompanied by an affidavit from the architect or engineer stating the safe allowable floor load on each floor in pounds per square foot uniformly distributed. The computations and affidavit shall be filed as a permanent record of the building department. 
                  (3)  Signs required.

Such plates shall not be removed or defaced, and if lost, removed or defaced, shall be replaced by the owner of the building.

                  d.  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will made possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system. 
                  e.  The grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the construction codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (3)  Condition of variances. In granting the variance, the construction board of adjustment and appeals may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed, or both.

The lien of such occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the sheriff of the county upon the property of defendant located in such jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of such execution, with interest and costs.

The notice shall disclose the charges against the holder of the registration and shall state the time, date and place of hearing, which hearing shall not be held less than five days nor more than 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice by the registration holder. If, upon final hearing, the board of commissioners shall, in accordance with the opinion it entertains as to the evidence and testimony submitted, believe that the registration holder is guilty of the charges made, it shall be board's duty to suspend or revoke the license of the person to whom it was issued or by whom it was held. 
                  (b)  The county manager may, if he shall deem it necessary for the protection or welfare of the people of the county, suspend the occupation tax certificate of any person against whom charges have been made, pending final hearing on the issue of whether or not the occupation tax certificate of this person should be further suspended or revoked. Prior to any such suspension, the county manager shall hold an informal hearing with the holder of the occupation tax certificate to hear such holder's response to the charges and the proposed suspension. The county manager shall then make the decision regarding suspension pending final hearing. In the event of either suspension or revocation, such person shall immediately cease to conduct the business, trade, profession or occupation in the county, for which the occupation tax certificate was issued, or suffer the penalties set forth in this article.

Such amendment may increase or lower the amounts and tax rates of any occupation and may change the classification thereof. The payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting the levy or collection by the jurisdiction of additional occupation taxes upon the same person, property, or business.

                  Sec. 26-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 26-34(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 26-34(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occur.

                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;

                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 26-34(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 26-34(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 9-11-2012, § 2) 
                  Sec. 26-35. - Application; permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Screven County without first obtaining a permit from the local issuing authority to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the zoning office and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 26-35(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 26-34(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) and (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 26-34(c)(15) and (16) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 26-35(b)(6), has been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 26-34(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this artucle, any variances required by subsections 26-34(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 26-35(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 26-36. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The local issuing authority will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The local issuing authority shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to Code section 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's article and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  ARTICLE III. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 26-71. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the county and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. 
                  (b)  Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  (Ord. No. 99-07, § 1.2, 6-8-1999) 
                  Sec. 26-72. - Objectives of article. 
                  The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  (2)  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
                  (3)  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.

                  Sec. 26-73. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. (Note: This is the same definition used in the Groundwater Use Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-90 et seq.)). 
                  Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with aquifer recharge area) means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps prepared by the state department of natural resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by the DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

                  (b)  Enforcement. The county environment control office, its agent, officers and employees shall have authority to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing their duties under this article and may take or cause to be made such examinations, surveys or sampling as the environment control office deems necessary. 
                  (1)  The county environment control officer is hereby designated as the administrator and enforcement officer for this article. 
                  (2)  The county environment control office shall have authority to enforce this article; issue permits under this article; and address violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator. 
                  (3)  Law enforcement officials or other officials having police powers shall have authority to assist the county environment control office with enforcement. 
                  (4)  Any person who commits, takes part in or assists in any violation of any provision of this article shall be fined not more than $1,000.00 for each offense. Each violation shall be a separate offense and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense. 
                  (5)  The county environment control office shall have the authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as identified in section 26-78. 
                  (6)  When a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this article, the violator shall be required to remove the structure. 
                  (7)  When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this article, the violator shall be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation, as far as practicable. 
                  (c)  Permit review and site plan requirement. With the exception of certain exempted activities identified in subsection (d) of this section, applications for a development permit within the groundwater recharge area district shall include a site plan. The following information is required for all site plans: 
                  (1)  A map, drawn to a scale of one inch equals 50 feet, showing all planned improvements including the width, depth and length of all existing and proposed structures, roads, watercourses and drainage ways, water lines, wastewater and stormwater facilities, and utility installations, shall be provided by the applicant. 
                  (2)  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site. 
                  (3)  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
                  (4)  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than five feet. 
                  (5)  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. 
                  (6)  Calculations of the amount of cut and fill proposed and cross sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades in areas of fill or excavation. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on cross sectional drawings. 
                  (7)  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of such site plan. Significant changes to the site plan that would alter the amount and velocity of stormwater runoff from the site, increase the amount of impervious surface within the development, alter the overall density of development, result in a considerable increase in the amount of excavation, fill or removal of vegetation during construction or otherwise result in an alteration of the overall appearance of the development as proposed, can be amended only with the approval of the county environment control office. Minor changes, such as the realignment of streets or minor alterations to drainage structures and other infrastructure to meet unexpected conditions are exempted from this requirement.

                  Sec. 26-111. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  (b)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (c)  It is, therefore, necessary for the county to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands.

                  Sec. 26-112. - Title and purpose of article. 
                  This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of the county. The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.

                  Sec. 26-113. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Functions means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quantity and quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; and educational, historical and archeological value protection and scenic, aesthetic and recreational amenities. 
                  Generalized wetland map means a map showing the general locations of wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county. 
                  Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soils conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the soil conservation service. 
                  Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
                  Jurisdictional determination means an official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or, in the case of coastal marshlands, the state department of natural resources. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in section 26-115(c). 
                  Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life saturate soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 
                  Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps. 
                  Wetland protection district means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county board of commissioners and shown on the generalized wetland map.

                  Sec. 26-114. - Wetland protection district. 
                  (a)  Generally. This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the county. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the county environment control office. 
                  (b)  District boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (c)  Relationship to zoning. The wetland protection district is hereby established. The wetland protection district shall comprise an overlay zone that supplements and is indicated on the zoning map, which is hereby incorporated and made part of this article by reference. When the two conflict, the more restrictive shall apply. 
                  (Ord. No. 99-09, § 2, 6-22-1999) 
                  Sec. 26-115. - Local development permits. 
                  (a)  Requirements generally. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the county board of commissioners in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (b) of this section or by other local development ordinances shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 25 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland protection map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission. To find out whether the activity requires a 404 permit, or to request a jurisdictional determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, mail inquiries to: 
                  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  Regulatory Branch  P.O. Box 889  Savannah, Georgia 31402-0889.  1-800-448-2402 
                  (b)  Requirements within the wetland district setback. Prior to issuance of any development permit for any activity within 25 feet of a wetland, the applicant must include, with the site plans for the proposed action, documentation for which the following postdevelopment conditions will prevail at the site: 
                  (1)  The rate of stormwater runoff, volume of stormwater runoff, and peak runoff from the site will not exceed predevelopment levels. 
                  (2)  The amount of the following pollutants carried with runoff from the site will not exceed predevelopment conditions: 
                  a.  Phosphorus; 
                  b.  Nitrogen; 
                  c.  Zinc; 
                  d.  Lead. 
                  In addition, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and turbidity (TSS) shall not exceed predevelopment levels. 
                  (3)  In addition to other fees assessed, the applicant may be held liable for costs incurred by the county enviornment control office during evaluation of the performance standards evaluation. 
                  (c)  Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided that they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided in this article: 
                  (1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided that they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (4)  The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture and an undisturbed vegetated setback/buffer of 25 feet shall be maintained between the agriculture practice and the wetland. 
                  (5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed, provided that there is an undisturbed vegetated setback/buffer of 25 feet between the pasturing activities and the wetland. 
                  (6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (7)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the county environment control office for the following reasons: 
                  a.  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the county environment office and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  b.  Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing agricultural operations. 
                  c.  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agriculture and agricultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (c)(4) of this section. 
                  d.  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, and wildlife management shelters, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  (d)  Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet, with the following information: 
                  (1)  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross sectional drawings. 
                  (2)  A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant. 
                  (3)  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 50 feet. 
                  (4)  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
                  (5)  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet; and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent. 
                  (6)  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. 
                  (7)  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 
                  (e)  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of such site plan. The site plan may be amended only with the approval of the county environment control office which may require additional information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this article or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this article. 
                  (f)  Subdivision approval in the wetland protection district. Any application for a subdivision approval shall include a jurisdictional determination approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, subdivision approval will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter permission. 
                  (g)  Subdivision design options in the wetland protection district. Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options: 
                  (1)  Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The county environment control office may allow a reduction in lot size, provided that the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The county environment control office shall allow no more than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot. 
                  (2)  Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the county environment control office will allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible. 
                  (h)  Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the county environment control office. Filing fees up to a maximum of $180.00 may be required to evaluate the application. This fee may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services pertaining to functional assessment, mitigation and wetland boundary determinations as deemed necessary by the county environment control office. 
                  (i)  Enforcement authority. The environment control officer is hereby established as the administrator of this article.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Buffer means a natural or enhanced vegetated area located adjacent to a protected river and containing flora native to that area. 
                  Hazardous material means any substance defined as "hazardous material" by the state department of natural resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-8-60 et seq. 
                  Hazardous waste means those solid and liquid waste or combinations thereof that may cause or contribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious, irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness, or which pose a substantial threat to human health when improperly handled. 
                  Land disturbing activity means any operation that involves excavation or filling of land; clearing or vegetation; and construction, rebuilding, or alteration of an existing structure. Land disturbing activity does not include ordinary maintenance and landscaping activities; yard and grounds maintenance, individual home gardens; repairs or minor modifications to a single-family residence; or the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
                  Natural vegetated area means an undeveloped area largely free from human disturbance where naturally occurring vegetation is allowed to remain undisturbed or is enhanced and maintained by human intervention. Activities specifically allowed in such an area include: 
                  (1)  Conservation of preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, shellfish, and other wildlife. 
                  (2)  Outdoor recreation activities including hunting, fishing, trapping, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, swimming, canoeing, skeet and trap shooting, education, scientific research, and nature trails. 
                  (3)  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located road, structures, and utilities used in the service of the public, provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that negative effects on the previous nature of the land shall be minimized. 
                  (4)  Limited excavating, filling and land disturbance necessary for the repair and maintenance of structures necessary to the uses permissible in the area as described in this definition. 
                  Nonconforming use means a land use activity, building, or structure legally established prior to adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, or subsequent amendment to it that would not otherwise be permissible under the provisions of this article. 
                  Outlay district means a district that applies supplementary regulations to land previously classified as belonging to a specific zoning district or land use category. 
                  Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. 
                  River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  River corridor means all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of a protected river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. Because stream channels move due to natural processes, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purpose of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the time of adoption of the river corridor protection plan. Any shift in the location after that time will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of comprehensive plan review by the state department of community affairs. 
                  River corridor protection plan means the part of the local comprehensive plan which deals with the river corridor protection requirements specified in this article. 
                  Sensitive natural areas means any area, as identified by the state department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following: 
                  (1)  Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species; 
                  (2)  Rare or exemplary natural communities; 
                  (3)  Significant landlords, hydroforms, or geological features; or 
                  (4)  Other areas so designated by the state department of natural resources; and which are sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration. 
                  Setback measurement means the measurement for buffer area which shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in the slope. 
                  Single-family dwelling means a dwelling structure that is designated for the use of one family. 
                  Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems, and railroads.

                  (a)  The Savannah River and Ogeechee River Corridor Protection District is hereby designated and shall comprise the land within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the Savannah and Ogeechee Rivers, which has been designated as a protected river by the state department of community affairs. 
                  (b)  The boundary shall be set as places readily identifiable on the county zoning map. 
                  (c)  The district establishes measures to guide future growth and development in areas adjacent to the Savannah River and Ogeechee River. Because these protective measures allow some latitude with land uses and because the district is not intended to prescribe a specific land use but rather to define a range of acceptable land uses, the district is designated as an overlay district. Within the range of land uses which can be located within the district, there are established in section 26-155 protection criteria which apply to development within the district.

                  b.  The dwelling shall be located on a parcel of land containing at least two acres. For the purpose of these standards, the size of the parcel shall not include any area within the protected river (that is, for parcels that include the area between the river banks, that portion cannot be counted towards the two-acre minimum size). 
                  c.  There shall be only one such dwelling on each two-acre or larger parcel of land. A septic tank serving such a dwelling may be located within the buffer area. However, the septic tank drainfields shall not be located within the buffer area. 
                  (2)  Construction of road crossings and utility crossings of river corridors are exempt, provided that construction of such road and utility crossings shall meet all requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), and of the applicable local articles on soil erosion and sedimentation control.

                  b.  Installation and maintenance of the utilities shall be such as to protect the integrity of the buffer area as well as is reasonably possible; and 
                  c.  Utilities shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water. 
                  (6)  Specific forestry and agricultural activities except as discussed in subsection (d)(7) of this section. 
                  (7)  The following acceptable uses of river corridors are allowed, provided that such uses do not impair the longterm functions of the protected river or the river corridor:

                  1.  Forestry activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the state forestry commission; and 
                  2.  Forestry activity shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  b.  Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8. 
                  c.  Wastewater treatment. 
                  d.  Recreational usage consistent either with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river-dependent recreation. For example, a boat ramp would be consistent with this criterion but a hard-surfaced tennis court would not. Parking lots are not consistent with this criterion. Paths and walkways within the river corridor are consistent with this criterion. 
                  e.  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  f.  Agricultural production and management, subject to the following conditions:

                  Sec. 30-1. - Purpose and intent of chapter. 
                  (a)  The board of commissioners of Screven County, Georgia ("BOC") finds that the best interests of the citizens of the county will be served by the availability of adequate fire protection to the citizens of the unincorporated areas of the county and those cities or municipalities which chose to be served by the county's fire department and to have the cost of that department be borne by the citizens who use the service. One purpose of this chapter is the creation of a county fire department by incorporating the existing volunteer fire units within the county, other than those funded and supported by the City of Newington and City of Sylvania, as county firefighting units. 
                  Further, the BOC has determined that the most effective and appropriate means of providing adequate fire protection for the citizens living in the unincorporated areas of Screven County ("county") and those living within incorporated areas which wish to be served by the county's fire department ("department"), (which department was established as provided in section 30-3 of this Code in 1999), is to establish a fire protection special service district ("district") for that purpose pursuant to the provisions of the Georgia Constitution, article IX, section II, paragraph III ("Supplemental Powers Clause") and article IX, section II, paragraph IV ("Special Districts Clause"). 
                  (b)  Further, pursuant to those provisions set out in subsection (a) above, the BOC finds it to be in the best interest of the citizens of the county to fund the operation of the county's fire department by the implementation of a "special services tax levy" and such other fees and assessments as allowed by law sufficient to cover the cost of maintaining, operating and equipping the department, including the cost of capital items such as the acquisition of real property for fire stations, fire engines and other equipment and machinery. The BOC has determined that a special fund is to be created within the county's accounting system and all funds collected for the purpose of supporting the department, from the citizens of the unincorporated area of the county and from those cities or municipalities which enter into intergovernmental agreements to be served by the department (as defined below), be allocated to that fund and all such funds be utilized only for the services provided by the department within the district. No portion of the funds collected as part of the general ad valorem tax imposed upon all citizens of the county shall be used to support the department. 
                  (Ord. No. 99-05, § 2, 5-25-1999; Ord. of 1-9-2018, § 2) 
                  Sec. 30-2. - Definitions.

                  Fire protection special service district assessment means the millage rate or fee established annually by the BOC to fund solely the operation of the Department and may be referred to in this chapter as "assessment" or "millage." 
                  Manufactured home, mobile home or similar terms See section 42-2 of this Code. Such relocatable structures may be referred to herein as a "relocatable structure."

                  (Ord. No. 1-9-2018, § 4)

                  Sec. 30-5. - Fire protection special service assessment or millage. 
                  (a)  Pursuant to the Supplemental Powers and Special Districts clauses of the Georgia Constitution, there is hereby established and levied an annual fire protection special service district assessment as defined in section 30-2. The assessment shall be levied against all parcels within the fire protection special service district, whether or not a business, residence or relocatable structure is located thereon or not. If more than one business, residence or relocatable structure is located on one taxable parcel, the assessment shall be levied against each such business, residence or relocatable structure. 
                  (b)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, when a manufactured home, mobile home or similar relocatable structure (as defined herein) is situated on a taxable parcel, which is not owned by the owner of the parcel, the assessment shall be assessed against the owner of the relocatable structure and no permit required pursuant to county or state law shall be issued for such relocatable structure for which such permit is sought until the millage due thereon has been paid in full. 
                  (c)  If a business, residence or relocatable structure is not located on a taxable parcel on January 1 of any calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2018, or if construction of a building or dwelling is not completed and the business or dwelling occupied on January 1 of any calendar year, commencing on January 1, 2018, then the owner of the parcel on which the business, dwelling or relocatable structure is located or, in the case of relocatable structures owned by someone other than the owner of the parcel upon which it is situated, shall pay a percentage of the assessment determined by dividing the number of months or parts of a month during which the business, dwelling or structure is located on the parcel by 12. 
                  (d)  To the extent allowed by state law, the assessment established in this chapter shall be included on the tax statements for ad valorem taxes created by the tax commissioner of the county and delinquent payments shall be charged such fees and interest and collected in the same manner as other delinquent ad valorem taxes. 
                  (e)  All revenues derived from payment of the assessment established in this chapter shall be assigned to a special fund created within the county's accounting system and all such funds collected from the citizens of the unincorporated area of the county and from those cities or municipalities which enter into intergovernmental agreements to be served by the county allocated to that fund shall be utilized only for the services provided by the department within the district, including the maintaining, operating and equipping the department, the acquisition of land and the construction of buildings to be used solely to house the equipment and personnel of the department, and similar such uses. If, at the end of any fiscal year, there remain any funds unexpended in the account so established, the same shall not lapse or revert to the general funds of the county, but shall be maintained exclusively for the purposes specified in this chapter. 
                  (f)  No part of the revenues derived from the assessment established in this chapter shall be used for any purpose other than those specified in this chapter and no part of the ad valorem revenues derived by the county from property located within municipalities not electing to be part of the district shall be used for such purposes. It is the intent of the county board of commissioners that neither property located within the limits of municipalities not electing to be included within the district nor the owners thereof be required to support any fire fighting service performed outside the limits of such municipalities.

                  Sec. 34-31. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners, of Screven County, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. of 8-17-2010) 
                  Sec. 34-32. - Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of Screven County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 8-17-2010) 
                  Sec. 34-33. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 8-17-2010) 
                  Sec. 34-34. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Sec. 34-61. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-60(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 34-62(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  (ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 34-60(6) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  (ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  (iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "New Construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection 34-61(3)a.—c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-61, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection 34-61(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Division 4 of this article.

                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 34-41, then the county building and zoning administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Division 4 of this article. only if data are not available from these sources, then the provisons of following subsections 34-62(2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-60(4), "Elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The county building and zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (5)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the planning and zoning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. 
                  Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building.

                  National geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after July 22, 2010 [the effective date of the initial FIRM] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after July 8, 1997 [the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after July 8, 1997. [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is:

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  "Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions" is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  "Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (1)  The owner of any property which has been declared by the court as a nuisance shall be given a reasonable amount of time to comply with any order to abate the nuisance. 
                  (2)  If the owner of property which has been declared to constitute a nuisance fails to comply with the court's order, the court may authorize the county to take steps specified in a court order to repair, alter, improve, clear or demolish, or otherwise remedy the situation that causes the property to be a nuisance. 
                  (3)  The amount of the cost of the repair, alteration, cleaning, removal or demolition authorized by the court and undertaken by the county shall be a lien against the property upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the payment of all costs by the county and the filing of an itemized statement of the total sum of the costs by the county manager in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court on a lien docket maintained by the clerk for such purposes. If a dwelling, building, structure or property is removed or demolished by the county, it shall sell the materials of such dwelling and buildings or structures, and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the costs. 
                  (b)  Enforcement of lien. The county shall enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien imposed as provided herein in the following manner: 
                  (1)  The owner or parties at interest shall be allowed to satisfy the amount due on such lien by paying to the county, within 30 days after perfection of the lien, that is, filing on the lien docket, a sum of money equal to 25 percent of the total amount due and by further paying to the county the remaining balance due of such lien, together with interest at a rate of seven percent per annum, in three equal annual payments, each of which shall become due and payable on the anniversary date of the initial payment made as prescribed in this subsection. 
                  (2)  Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred or conveyed by the owner or parties at interest at any time prior to the termination of the three-year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the county. 
                  (3)  Should the amount due on such lien or any portion thereof be unpaid after the passage of the three-year period, or upon the occurrence of the contingency provided for in subsection (b)(2) of this section, the county may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-358 and other applicable statutes relating to tax liens. This procedure shall be subject to the right of redemption by any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon the property, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-4-40 et. seq.

                  If the whereabouts of an owner or party in interest is unknown and cannot be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence, upon such affidavit by the county manager or his or her designate, in rem service may be perfected by publication as provided herein as against any owner or party in interest for the realty which shall be sufficiently described in the notice as to put the public at large on notice of the proceedings.

                  Pursuant to the Georgia Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Act of 1990, O.C.G.A. § 12-8-20 et seq., the Joint Solid Waste Management Plan Five Year Short Term Work Program 1999-2003 is adopted.

                  ARTICLE II. - COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL 

                  Sec. 62-31. - Purpose and intent of article. 
                  (a)  The board of commissioners of Screven County, Georgia ("BOC") finds that the best interests of the citizens of the county will be served by the availability of adequate collection and disposition of solid waste in the unincorporated area of the county and those cities or municipalities which choose to be served by the county's solid waste management department, all in accordance with both federal and state regulation of the same, and to have the cost of the department be borne by the citizens who use the service. 
                  Further, the BOC has determined that the most effective and appropriate means of providing adequate solid waste collection and disposal for the citizens living in the unincorporated area of Screven County ("county") and those living within incorporated areas who wish to be served by the county's solid waste management department, as more particularly defined below, ("department"), is to establish a solid waste collection and disposal special service district ("district") for that purpose pursuant to the provisions of the Georgia Constitution, article IX, section II, paragraph III ("Supplemental Powers Clause") and article IX, section II, paragraph IV ("Special Districts Clause"). 
                  (b)  Further, pursuant to those provisions set out in subsection (a) above, the BOC finds it to be in the best interests of the citizens of the county to fund the operation of the county's solid waste management department by the implementation of a "special services tax," or such other fees and assessments as allowed by law, sufficient to cover the cost of maintaining, operating and equipping the department, including, but not limited to the cost of the acquisition of equipment, land and construction of buildings to be used solely for the purpose of implementing the operation of the department. The BOC has determined that a special fund is to be created within the county's accounting system and all funds collected for the purpose of supporting the department, from the citizens of the unincorporated area of the county and from those cities or municipalities which enter into intergovernmental agreements to be served by the department, be allocated to that fund and all such funds be utilized only for the services provided by the department within the district. No portion of the funds collected as part of the general ad valorem tax imposed upon all citizens of the county shall be used to support the department.

                  Major development includes but is not limited manufactured home parks, apartment complexes, condominiums, planned unit developments, and institutional, commercial, and industrial developments, or any other development determined by the zoning administrator as not meeting the definition of minor development, where the site is not subdivided into lots and public streets and is retained in one ownership. 
                  Major subdivision means any subdivision of land of six or more lots, or a subdivision with fewer than six lots but which involves the construction of a public or private street to serve lots created as part of a subdivision. For purposes of determining the number of lots, when a subdivision involves a re-subdivision of an existing lot that was approved part of a subdivision recorded after June 10, 1997, the zoning administrator shall count all lots that were included in the subdivision recorded after June 10, 1997. For example, if an applicant wants to split a single lot into two lots, and that single lot was part of a five-lot subdivision platted after June 10, 1997, the application is a major subdivision because it results in six lots. This definition is intended to avoid consecutive minor subdivision platting without (or to avoid) installing improvements required by this ordinance for major subdivisions, which defeats the objectives of this chapter. 
                  Manufactured home means a dwelling unit fabricated in an off-site facility for installation or assembly at the building site, bearing a label certifying it is constructed in compliance with the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended, 42 USC 5401 et seq.

                  Minor development means a development, a plan of which has been approved by the zoning administrator and which does not require approval by the planning commission, including any of the following: 
                  (1)  The development of a single-family residence or manufactured home on an existing individual lot, not involving the subdivision of land. 
                  (2)  The preparation of land for the addition of building space of 1,000 square feet or less or the addition of building space up to 25 percent of existing building space on an existing individual lot, neither of which involves the subdivision of land. 
                  (3)  Modifications to development plans that received prior approval by the planning commission which are determined by the zoning administrator to be minor in nature and where such modifications are consistent with the preliminary plan approved by the planning commission, on an existing individual lot, not involving the subdivision of land. 
                  (4)  Any land development which is exempt from the requirements of the Screven County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance, or in lieu of adoption of such local ordinance, the Georgia Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act (O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.)

                  (1)  The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are at least equal to standards set forth in this chapter and the county zoning ordinance. Provided, however, that this provision shall not be construed to prevent the replatting or reconfiguration of a nonconforming lot so long as the nonconformity is not increased (i.e., the lot cannot be made smaller or narrower than existed prior to subdivision). 
                  (2)  The division of a parcel or lot into five or less lots, where no new street is involved. For purposes of this definition, the number of lots shall be determined on the basis of and shall include all lots in the subdivision as it existed on June 10, 1997 (i.e., the date of adoption of this chapter). For example, if an applicant wants to split a single lot into two lots, and that single lot was part of a five-lot subdivision platted after June 10, 1997, the application is a major subdivision because it results in six lots. This definition is intended to avoid consecutive minor subdivision platting without (or to avoid) installing improvements required by this ordinance for major subdivisions, which defeats the objectives of this chapter. 
                  (3)  An intra-family land transfer, as defined by this ordinance and as regulated per section 66-292(a)(3) of this chapter. 
                  (4)  A dedication plat as defined by this ordinance.

                  Preliminary plan means a drawing of a major development which shows the proposed layout of a major development in sufficient detail to indicate its general design, which is submitted to the planning commission following sketch plan approval and required to be approved by the planning commission prior to the commencement of land development activities, or the installation of utilities and improvements, or the erection of buildings. Approval of a preliminary plan by the planning commission shall authorize a developer to submit detailed development plans for approval by the zoning administrator in accordance with the approved preliminary plan. 
                  Preliminary plat means a drawing of a major subdivision which shows the proposed layout in sufficient detail to indicate its general design, which is submitted to the planning commission following sketch plan approval and required to be approved by the planning commission prior to the commencement of land development activities, or the installation of utilities and improvements, or the erection of buildings. Approval of a preliminary plat by the planning commission and board of commissioners shall authorize a developer to submit detailed development plans for approval by the zoning administrator in accordance with the approved preliminary plat. 
                  Public improvement means any drainage ditch, roadway, parkway, sidewalk pedestrian way, tree, lawn, off-street parking area, lot improvement, or other facility for which the local government may ultimately assume the responsibility for maintenance and operation, or which may affect an improvement for which local government responsibility is established.

                  Screening means either a strip of at least ten feet wide, densely planted (or having equivalent natural growth) with shrubs or trees at least four feet high at the time of planting, of a type that will form a yearround dense screen at least six feet high; or an opaque wall or barrier or uniformly painted fence at least six feet high. 
                  Sketch plan means a generalized drawing which shows the conceptual layout of a major development. Its purpose is to serve as a basis for discussion without either the planning commission or the developer making commitments. 
                  Sketch plat means a generalized drawing which shows the conceptual layout of a major subdivision. Its purpose is to serve as a basis for discussion without either the planning commission or the developer making commitments.

                  Street or road, collector, means a road that is not on the state highway system. Such a road would usually serve to distribute traffic from individual lots to arterial streets or roads. They may also connect neighborhoods with one another. 
                  Street or road, local, means a road that serves adjacent property by providing access to the road network. A local street or road is characterized by short trips, low speeds, and small traffic volumes. The design of this type of road should be toward eliminating through traffic. 
                  Street, cul-de-sac, means a short local street having but one end open for vehicular traffic, the opposite end terminating with a permanent turnaround. 
                  Street, marginal access, means a minor service street which parallels and which is immediately adjacent to an arterial street (frontage road). 
                  Street perimeter means any existing street to which the parcel of land to be subdivided abuts one side. 
                  Street width means the shortest distance between the lines delineating the right-of-way of a street.

                  Yard means a required open space on a lot that is left unoccupied with structures and facilities, except as permitted in this chapter. A yard may also be known as a setback. 
                  Yard, front, means the open space on a lot located between the right-of-way boundary of the abutting street and the front building line as extended to the lot lines to either side. Any yard lying between an abutting street and the building line is considered a front yard. For example, in the case of a corner lot which is abutted on two sides by streets, both yards abutting the streets would be front yards; setbacks and other developments standard for front yards would apply to both of these yards. 
                  Yard, rear, means the open space located between the rear property line and the rear building line as extended to the side lot lines. 
                  Yard, side, means the open space located between the side property line and the side building lines as extended to the front and rear lot lines.

                  ARTICLE IV. - PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL 

                  Sec. 66-110. - Generally. 
                  This article shall govern the procedures for filing and processing sketch plats, preliminary plats, final plats, and major and minor development plans. No sketch plat, preliminary plat, final plat, major development, or minor development shall be approved by the county unless in compliance with this article. 
                  (Ord. of 11-9-2004(1), § 5) 
                  Sec. 66-111. - Processes. 
                  (a)  Major subdivision. The procedure for review, consideration, and approval of a major subdivision consists of four separate, required steps. These are: 
                  (1)  Sketch plat; 
                  (2)  Preliminary plat approved by the planning commission and board of commissioners; 
                  (3)  Administrative approval of development plans by the zoning administrator; and 
                  (4)  Final plat approval by the planning commission. 
                  No preliminary plat shall be submitted for review by the planning commission until a sketch plat has been submitted to the planning commission. No final plat shall be submitted for review by the planning commission until a preliminary plat has been submitted to and approved by the planning commission and improvement plans have been approved by the zoning administrator and improvements are installed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. A final plat of the major subdivision shall be submitted for review and approved by the planning commission prior to the sale of any lots in the major subdivision. 
                  (b)  Major development. The procedure for review, consideration, and approval of a major development plan, those not involving the subdivision of land, consists of three separate, required steps. These are: 
                  (1)  Sketch plan; 
                  (2)  Development plan approved by the planning commission and board of commissioners; and 
                  (3)  Administrative approval of development plans by the zoning administrator. 
                  No development plan shall be submitted for review by the planning commission until a sketch plan has been submitted to the planning commission. The zoning administrator shall not authorize development to commence until a development plan has been submitted to and approved by the planning commission and board of commissioners, and improvement plans have been approved by the zoning administrator. 
                  (c)  Minor subdivision. Minor subdivisions shall not require planning commission review or approval, nor shall they require the submittal of a sketch plat or preliminary plat. The process for gaining approval of a minor subdivision shall be administrative, by filing with the zoning administrator for approval an application for final plat and demonstrating compliance with the application and improvement requirements of this chapter and the county zoning ordinance. 
                  (d)  Limitations on minor subdivisions. The board of commissioners finds that minor subdivisions provide certain advantages, such as a shorter application process, fewer or no improvement requirements, and less public scrutiny, that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications. Given these advantages, the prospect exists that subdividers or successors in interest may seek to further divide a lot previously approved as part of a minor subdivision. Accordingly, no lot which is created as part of a minor subdivision after the effective date of this chapter amendment (Nov. 9. 2004) shall hereafter be further divided except pursuant to the requirements for major subdivisions as established in this chapter. Additionally, no lot which was platted as part of a minor subdivision approved after June 10, 1997, but prior to the effective date of this ordinance amendment, shall be further divided as a minor subdivision if the number of lots within the boundaries of the minor subdivision exceeds five. This shall not preclude a lot owner from subdividing pursuant to the major subdivision requirements of this chapter and the installation of all requirements for major subdivisions specified by this chapter. 
                  When a subdivision plat that would otherwise be considered a minor subdivision is required pursuant to the provisions of this section to be filed as a major subdivision, the planning commission may recommend and the board of commissioners may approve waivers, on a case-by-case basis after application there for and for good cause shown, to all or portions of the requirements of section 66-181 of this chapter. The purpose of this provision is to provide potential for relief to subdividers, as may be determined appropriate by the board of commissioners, who would without relief be required to install improvements for lots no longer owned by the subdivider. 
                  (e)  Minor development. Minor developments shall not require planning commission review or approval, nor shall they require the submittal of a sketch plan or preliminary plan. The process for gaining approval of a minor development shall be administrative, by filing with the zoning administrator for approval an application for minor development plan approval and demonstrating compliance with the application and improvement requirements of this ordinance and the county zoning ordinance. 
                  (Ord. No. 97-08, § 4.1, 6-10-1997; Ord. of 11-9-2004(1), § 6; Ord. of 7-12-05, § 2) 
                  Sec. 66-112. - Review procedure. 
                  The following procedure shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats: 
                  (1)  Sketch plan procedures. Prior to the review, consideration, and approval of a preliminary plat by the planning commission, the subdivider must submit to the building and zoning official a simple sketch plan of the proposed development. If phase development is contemplated, then a sketch for each phase will be required. Included with the sketch plan must be a sketch map which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning necessary for the preparation of the preliminary plat and enable the subdivider to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. Utilizing the comprehensive plan and this chapter, the building and zoning official shall review the sketch plan submittal for compliance with this chapter. If the sketch plan meets the requirements of this ordinance, the building and zoning official shall schedule it for presentation to the planning commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting. If discrepancies are found in the sketch plan, the building and zoning official shall note all such discrepancies on the sketch plan and return it to the subdivider for correction before presenting the same to the planning commission. Approval of the sketch plan does not authorize the developer to begin the proposed construction or improvements. 
                  (2)  Preliminary plat procedures. 
                  a.  Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the planning commission. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in four blue line prints and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained in this chapter. Preliminary plats submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name, phone number, and address of the subdivider (or subdivider's designee); and may not be approved until all requirements for preliminary plats are met. 
                  b.  Additional copies of the plat and supplemental information may be requested by the planning commission. The copies mentioned in this subsection shall be distributed as required by section 66-152 and other person or agency as deemed necessary by the planning commission. The person or agency to which a copy of the plat is directed shall indicate desired changes or comments of the plat and shall promptly return the plat to the planning commission. 
                  c.  Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the planning commission at least 30 days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting date of the commission. The planning commission shall act on the preliminary plat request within two regularly scheduled meetings after formal submission by making its recommendations concerning the plat in writing to the board of commissioners. Preliminary plats must be approved by the board of commissioners prior to proceeding with subdivision development. 
                  d.  The date on which the board of commissioners granted approval of the preliminary plat shall be noted on the plat. Failure of a subdivider to submit for final plat approval (where applicable) and initiate development within 18 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require resubmittal of a preliminary plan to the planning commission. 
                  e.  Application for approval of the final record plat will be considered only after the requirements for the preliminary plat approval as specified in this article have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of this chapter and the preparation of the final subdivision plat. If the subdivider fails to act within 18 months of approval of the preliminary plat, such approval shall become void unless an extension is requested by the subdivider and approved by the planning commission. 
                  (3)  Final plat procedure. 
                  a.  Application. Application for final plat approval of the subdivision plat, whether major or minor, shall be submitted to the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall examine the final plat to determine if it meets all requirements of these regulations, conforms to the approved preliminary plat, complies with the county zoning ordinance, has approval of the health department, has been reviewed and approved by Ogeechee Soil and Water Conservation District if required, includes roads designed and installed per specifications of this chapter or per the requirements of the zoning administrator, and includes the necessary easements, statements of dedication, and other specified plat notations. 
                  b.  Improvement guarantees. For applications for final plat approval involving property served or required to be served by a water and/or sewer system, the subdivider shall indicate who will operate the system or systems and what assurance will be given to the board of commissioners for continued operation. If roads are to be built, the subdivider will indicate such subdivider's proposal for a bond to the board of commissioners to assure their proper and timely construction and maintenance. 
                  c.  Approval of major subdivisions. If the application is complete and is for a major subdivision, the final plat shall be scheduled for consideration by the planning commission. The planning commission shall grant approval or require the subdivider to make necessary modifications to conform to the standards required of the final plat. 
                  d.  Approval of minor subdivisions. If the application is complete and is for a minor subdivision, the zoning administrator shall administratively approve the final plat of a minor subdivision or require the subdivider to make necessary modifications to conform to the standards required of the final plat. 
                  e.  Recording. If approved, upon gaining the signature of the zoning administrator and in the case of a major subdivision, the chairman of the planning commission, a final plat shall be recorded in the clerk's office of the county superior court. All final plats to be recorded shall bear the following approval statement and signature block: 
                  Approved for recording on the ____________ / ____________ / ____________ day of ____________ , 2 ____________ by the Screven County Zoning Administrator. 
                  ____________ 
                  Screven County Zoning Administrator 
                  Major subdivisions shall also contain the following approval statement and signature block: 
                  This subdivision was granted approval by the Screven County Planning Commission on ____________ / ____________ / ____________ , 2 ____________ . 
                  ____________ 
                  Chairman, Screven County Planning Commission 
                  f.  Approval by board of public dedications. Plats including a public dedication shall be submitted to the board of commissioners for acceptance of the proposed dedication of public property. 
                  (4)  Development plan procedure. 
                  a.  Application. Applications for development plan approval, whether major or minor, shall be submitted to the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall examine the development plan to determine if it meets all requirements of these regulations, conforms to the approved sketch plan if applicable, complies with the county zoning ordinance, has approval of the health department, has been reviewed and approved by Ogeechee Soil and Water Conservation District if required, includes roads designed and installed per specifications of this chapter or the requirements of the zoning administrator, and includes the necessary plan notations. 
                  b.  Approval of major developments. If the application is complete and is for a major development, the major development plan application shall be scheduled for consideration by the planning commission and board of commissioners. The planning commission and board of commissioners shall grant approval, grant conditional approval, or require the developer to make necessary modifications to conform to the standards required of the major development plan. 
                  c.  Approval of minor developments. If the application is complete and is for a minor development, the zoning administrator shall administratively approve the development plan, conditionally approve, or require the developer to make necessary modifications to conform to the standards required of the development plan.

                  Major subdivisions not exceeding ten lots which do not involve the platting, construction or opening of new streets, water or sewer facilities, or improvement of existing streets shall be considered by the planning commission in the form of a final plat. Such plat shall comply in all respects to these regulations. Sketch plans and preliminary plats are not required in such cases.

                  1.  Purpose. The cultural, historical, and natural resources of the county have unique characteristics and are invaluable to present and future generations of the county residents. Land development, without regard to these resources, may lead to their destruction, producing significant adverse economic and environmental impacts and threatening the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the county. The purpose of this subsection is to encourage developers to consider cultural, historical, and natural resources when proposing a development project and that they take all reasonable steps to minimize adverse impacts from such development. Land development and resources conservation can and must be viewed as complimentary activities. 
                  2.  Site analysis. In order for the building and zoning official to make an informed decision in a timely manner, the developer shall prepare an analysis of the characteristics of the development site, such as site context; geology and soils, with severe limitations to development; wetlands; floodplains; topography, ecology, existing vegetation, structures, and road networks; visual features; and past and present use of the site. The analysis narrative shall be included as a component of the preliminary plat application. The developer may include topographic maps, wetlands maps, or other pertinent supporting documentation. 
                  3.  Subdivision and site design. 
                  i.  Design of the development should take into consideration all existing local and regional plans for the surrounding community. 
                  ii.  Development of the site should be based on the site analysis. To the maximum extent practicable, development should be located to conserve the natural features of the site, to avoid areas of environmental sensitivity, and to minimize negative impacts and alteration of natural features. 
                  iii.  When any of the following natural features are identified on the site, sound planning or engineering solutions are required to reduce or eliminate any negative effects of the proposed development or such features shall remain undisturbed, in accordance with applicable federal, state or local regulations: 
                  (a)  Unique and/or fragile areas, including wetlands as defined in section 404, Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, and delineated on wetlands maps prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. When wetlands are identified by the analysis, the applicant should contact the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine if such wetlands are jurisdictional wetlands and, if so, to secure the necessary permits and/or clearance before a building or use permit shall be issued by the county. 
                  (b)  Significant trees or stands of trees, defined as the largest known individual trees of each species in the state, large trees approaching the diameter of the known largest tree, or species or clumps of trees that are rare to the area or of particular horticultural or landscape value. The developer should consult with the state forestry commission records for rare or valuable trees. 
                  (c)  Land in the floodplain, as defined by state or local regulations. Where floodplains are identified by the analysis, and shown on the flood hazard boundary maps for the county, all development shall comply with standards adopted as part of the county flood hazard prevention ordinance (division 3 of article II, chapter 34). 
                  (d)  Steep slopes in excess of 20 percent as measured over a 100-foot interval unless appropriate engineering measures concerning slope stability, erosion, and resident safety are taken. 
                  (e)  Habitats of threatened or endangered wildlife species, as identified on federal or state lists, defined by the Endangered Species Act. The developer should contact the state department of natural resources' natural heritage program to identify potential conflicts. 
                  (f)  Historically significant structures and sites, as listed on federal or state lists of historic places. 
                  iv.  The development should be laid out to avoid adversely affecting groundwater and aquifer recharge; to reduce cut and fill; to prevent flooding; to provide adequate access to lots and sites; and to mitigate adverse effects of noise, odor, traffic, drainage, and utilities on neighboring properties. 
                  (3)  Proposed conditions. 
                  a.  Layout of streets, roads, alleys, public crosswalk, with widths, road names, or designations, grades and cross sections. 
                  b.  Profile of proposed streets showing natural and finished grades with percent of grade slope. 
                  c.  Detailed layout of all lots, including building setback lines, scaled dimensions on lots, and utility easements with width and use.

                  (4)  Review and approval. The preliminary plat shall be approved by the planning commission only after review and approval of the following: 
                  a.  The designated representative of the director of the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, or as may be subsequently required by Georgia law, shall review the water supply and sewage disposal facilities to be provided on all preliminary plats after being provided with such percolation test or other information as it may require. 
                  b.  The county manager or his designees shall review the preliminary plat for conformity of its proposed streets with adopted design standards, if any, and existing and proposed public street improvements. 
                  c.  A land disturbing activity permit, pursuant to the Georgia Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), including all amendments in effect as of the date of application for such permit, shall be required to any land disturbing activity on the project site. Land disturbing activity includes, but is not limited to, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land. An approved sediment and erosion control plan and review by the soil conservation service and/or other agencies or official designated by the planning commission is required as part of the application for the permit. 
                  d.  The county manager or his designees shall determine if any other agencies may have appropriate comment and shall review the preliminary plat for potential impacts of the subdivision.

                  (1)  Subdivision corner tie. At least one corner of the subdivision shall be designated by course and distance (tie) from a readily discernable reference marker. If a corner is within 2,000 feet of a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Station, U.S. Geological Survey, or state grid system coordinated monument, then this corner shall be marked with a monument so designated by computed X and Y coordinates which shall appear on the map with a statement identifying this station or monument to an accuracy of 1:10,000. When such a monument or station is not available, the tie shall be made to some permanent and readily recognizable landmark or identifiable point, physical object or structure. In subdivisions of more than ten lots, the information for this corner tie shall include elevation above sea level making it in effect a benchmark which can be used to determine if individual lots are in a floodprone area. 
                  (2)  Monuments. 
                  a.  Monuments shall be located in the ground at all angles in the boundaries of the subdivision; at the intersection lines of streets and at the intersection of the lines of streets with boundaries of the plat and at the intersection of alleys with the boundaries of the subdivision; at all points of curvature, points in the side lines of streets and alleys; and at all angles of an intermediate traverse line. 
                  b.  It is not intended or required that monuments be placed within the traveled portion of a street to mark angles in the boundary of the subdivision if the angle points can be readily reestablished by reference to monuments along the side lines of the streets. 
                  c.  All required monuments shall be placed flush with the ground, where practicable. 
                  d.  If the required location of a monument is in an inaccessible place, or where the location of a monument would be clearly impractical, it is sufficient to place a reference monument nearby and the precise location thereof shall be clearly indicated on the plat and referenced to the true point. 
                  e.  All monuments used shall be made of a minimum of solid iron or steel bars at least one-half inch in diameter and 24 inches long. 
                  f.  If a point required to be marked by a monument is on a bedrock outcropping, a steel rod, at least one-half inch in diameter shall be drilled and grouted into solid rock to a depth of at least eight inches. 
                  (3)  Control corners. Within each block of a subdivision at least two monuments designed and designated as control corners shall be installed. All control corners shall be constructed of concrete and shall be at least four inches in diameter or square and not less than three feet in length. Each monument shall have imbedded in its top or attached by a suitable means, a metal plate of noncorrosive materials and marked plainly with the point, the surveyor's registration number, the month and year it was installed and the words "control corner." 
                  (4)  Property markers. A steel or wrought iron pipe or the equivalent not less than one-half inch in diameter and at least 24 inches in length shall set all corners, except those located by monuments. 
                  (5)  Accuracy. Land surveys, both within the limits of incorporated areas and beyond shall be at an accuracy of at least 1:7,500.

                  ARTICLE VI. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

                  Sec. 66-181. - Number of lots versus improvement standards. 
                  By permitting varying numbers of lots and varying levels of improvements, regulations enable the small developer to provide for growth in the rural, more slowly developing area of the county characterized by a lower lot absorption rate. Less restrictive development standards are imposed according to quantity of lots to allow for flexibility in subdivision sizes. 

                   
                  (Ord. No. 97-08, § 6.1, 6-10-1997; Ord. of 11-9-2004(1), § 13; Ord. of 7-12-05, §§ 6—8) 
                  Sec. 66-182. - Additional required improvements for major subdivisions of 11 or more lots. 
                  A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by this chapter necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat. 
                  (1)  Natural gas. When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties. 
                  (2)  Water supply. Water systems installed in subdivisions of more than 20 lots shall provide fire flow capability. The system shall be designed and installed to meet or exceed the minimum standards adopted by the state for water systems, including those which may be utilized for fire protection. Water mains shall provide a minimum flow of 500 gallons per minute for two hours, plus potable water demand at the furthermost point from the tank. Fire hydrants shall be located so as to best serve the proposed residences of the subdivision and as shall be approved by the county's fire service coordinator or the planning commission. Fire hydrants shall be installed so that the distance from the landscaped finished grade to the lower threads of the barrel opening shall be no less than 24 inches. All fire hydrants shall open counterclockwise and shall be painted per NFPA color coding for through flow. 
                  (3)  Sanitary sewer. If a sanitary sewer is installed in a subdivision, sanitary sewers shall be installed to the plans and specifications approved by and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. 
                  (4)  Sewage disposal system. Prior to the construction of any community sewage disposal system such as private septic tanks, an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size, plans and specifications of such a facility shall be approved by and be in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the board of commissioners, and the county health department. 
                  (5)  Curb and gutters. If concrete curbs or paved valley type gutters are required, they shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by an engineer, registered surveyor or architect and approved by the building and zoning official, or the local governing authority or its designee. 
                  (6)  Street grading and surfacing. Street grading, base preparation, and surfacing shall be carried out by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the county or the state department of transportation. 
                  (7)  Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system designed to accommodate a 25-year, 24-hour rain event, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the building and zoning official. 
                  (8)  Street name signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision. The location and design shall be approved by the board of commissioners or its designee. 
                  (9)  Topsoil. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four inches of cover between sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting. The excavation and treatment of overburden during construction shall be inspected by the Natural Resource Conservation Service. 
                  (10)  Paving. Paving shall be as required in section 66-181 hereinabove. It is the intent of this provision that where paved access is required, all lots in the subdivision shall have paved access to an existing paved road or paved highway. Further, where paving is required, the planning commission shall approve the design of the proposed streets or roads at the sketch plan stage. 
                  (11)  Subdivision entrances. At the sketch plan, the planning commission may limit the number of entrances, driveways, or curb cuts. At the preliminary and final plat stages, the building and zoning official shall coordinate with the county manager, county engineer, and public safety director with respect to entrances, driveways, or curb cuts. Design standards on county or state roads shall be consistent with all state, federal, and local laws and applicable chapters, including the state department of transportation rules and all amendments or revisions in effect as of the date of the preliminary plat approval. At the sketch plan stage, the planning commission may consider safety as well as require available alternatives for reducing the number of entrances, driveways or curb cuts.

                  Sec. 66-185. - Dedications. 
                  (a)  Acceptance of public streets. It is the policy of the county that all subdivision streets and roads shall be dedicated and deeded to the county following proper construction unless the developer specifically requests that a street be accepted as a private street and the board of commissioners approves such request. Approval of a private street shall be the exception and the board of commissioners may require conditions to such approval as in its discretion it deems necessary for the public good and the protection and safety of the citizens of the county. (See section 66-186.) Following construction of the street or road, the board of commissioners shall consider a properly prepared deed tendered by the developer and upon formal acceptance of the deed by the commissioners, the street or road shall become part of the county road system. Construction of streets and roads, and paving where required, shall be completed prior to final plat approval. 
                  (b)  Construction standards. All streets shall be constructed to standards adopted by the county. The design of the street shall be approved by the planning commission and construction shall be monitored by representatives of the county. Driveways, storm drainage, culverts, utility cuts and the like shall be installed during construction of the street or road and prior to paving. 
                  (c)  Warranty of public streets and roads. The developer shall provide a postconstruction warranty of each street or road accepted by the county as part of the county road system as to workmanship and materials for a period of one year. The developer shall provide a bond or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of and acceptable to the county in the amount of one-half of the cost of construction of the street or road the terms of which shall provide that of the county road superintendent, or such other person as may be designated by the board of commissioners, shall determine during the warranty period that a deficiency in the road requires correction, and the developer shall fail to make such correction in a timely manner as determined by the county in its sole discretion, then the entity providing the bond or letter shall, upon written application by the county, pay such sum as shall be demanded, up to the total amount of the bond or letter, for the purpose of making the repair or correcting the deficiency. 
                  (d)  Street or road signs and traffic control devices. The developer shall pay for and install all required street name signs and traffic control signs or devices. 
                  (e)  Homeowners associations. The county shall not be a member of a homeowners association by virtue of its ownership of the streets and roads in a subdivision or otherwise. 
                  (Ord. No. 97-08, § 6.5, 6-10-1997) 
                  Sec. 66-186. - Private streets. 
                  (a)  In certain circumstances, the board of commissioners may approve the construction of a private street within a subdivision. A private street is a street that is not accepted by the county as part of the county road system and is privately owned and maintained. Such streets or roads shall be constructed to the same standards and shall meet all other requirements with regard to road construction as is provided in this chapter for public streets or roads, including, but not limited to, the requirement for a minimum right-of-way of 60 feet. In addition, the developer shall: 
                  (1)  Provide the county with a written release of maintenance agreement, acceptable to the county manager, releasing the county from responsibility for present or future maintenance and upkeep of the roadway; 
                  (2)  Erect a sign indicating the existence of a private street at the intersection of each public street with a private street; 
                  (3)  Include a disclosure statement on all sales agreements, deeds and plats relating to the subdivision or its lots indicating that the street or road is a private street, that the county has no responsibility for its maintenance or upkeep, the nature of the ownership of the street and responsibility for its maintenance and upkeep, and the rights of purchasers of lots in the subdivision to enforce such provisions. 
                  (b)  Such streets shall be platted and deeded to a responsible association or entity, such as a homeowners association, approved by the board of commissioners. The board of commissioners may require, as a condition to approval of a private street or road: 
                  (1)  That the developer provide a specific maintenance plan or financial guarantee of proper maintenance and repair; 
                  (2)  Access easements in favor of the county and its various departments and agencies; or 
                  (3)  Such other concessions as are deemed appropriate for the public good and the benefit of the lot owners.

                  Sec. 66-188. - Access. 
                  Neither the planning commission nor the board of commissioners shall approve a subdivision in a location where the existing roads providing primary access are inadequate to serve the additional traffic generated by the development. Where existing roads are inadequate to serve the additional traffic, the planning commission and board of commissioners shall require paved access to the subdivision from an existing paved county road or state or federal highway. If the ditches on existing county roads are to be used for drainage from the subdivision, the developer shall regrade such ditches and provide an all-weather drainage outlet. All regarding and drainage outlets shall be approved by the board of commissioners or its authorized representatives. 
                  (Ord. No. 97-08, § 6.8, 6-10-1997; Ord. of 11-9-2004(1), § 15)

                  ARTICLE VII. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

                  Sec. 66-221. - Generally. 
                  The standards contained in this article shall apply to the subdivision of land, the platting of lots, the development of all new public and private streets, and the establishment of all easements. These standards are in addition to the minimum requirements established in the county zoning ordinance for the zoning district in which the development or subdivision is located. 
                  (Ord. No. 97-08, § 7.0, 6-10-1997; Ord. of 11-9-2004(1), § 16) 
                  Sec. 66-222. - Streets. 
                  Streets shall conform to current county road construction and maintenance specifications. that is, paving to Georgia DOT standards for paving or maintenance of county roads, provided, however, that the board of commissioners may establish reduced standards for construction of collector streets or roads and, specifically, paved access from a subdivision to an existing paved county, state or federal road, as set out in section 66-181, where, in the sole opinion of the board, traffic volumes, the location of the subdivision, or other such considerations, permit a deviation from DOT standards for construction of a county paved road. In such cases, the Board may establish such requirements as it deems necessary and appropriate to protect the citizens of the county. 
                  (1)  Conformity to existing maps or plans. The location and width of all proposed streets shall be in conformity with official plans and maps and with existing amended plans of the planning commission. 
                  (2)  Continuation of adjoining street system. The proposed street layout shall be coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area. Where possible, existing major streets shall be extended. 
                  (3)  Access to adjacent properties. Where it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turnaround shall be provided. Houses fronting on minor streets shall have access from minor streets only. 
                  (4)  Street names. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, regardless of the use of suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat, by marking or in any deed or instrument, without first getting approval of the county manager or his designee. 
                  (5)  Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
                  (6)  Trees. It is recommended that as many trees as possible remain on the site during the initial clearing and grading and that trees normally remain unless they lie within a planned public right-of-way, within a planned building site or within the necessary paved areas surrounding or adjacent to the primary structure. 
                  (7)  Railroads and highways (freeways, expressways). Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows: 
                  a.  In residential districts, a buffer strip not less than 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highways. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be so designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs by the owner. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited." 
                  b.  In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites. 
                  c.  All other streets which are parallel to the railroad, when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
                  (8)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets by less than 125 feet shall be prohibited. 
                  (9)  Right angle intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as practicable. 
                  (10)  Cul-de-sac. A cul-de-sac shall not extend more than 800 feet in length and shall provide a turnaround having a roadway radius of not less than 55 feet and a right-of-way radius of not less than 75 feet. Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a turnaround radius of not less than 30 feet. 
                  (11)  Alleys. Service alleys or drives maybe required in multiple dwelling, commercial, and industrial developments and shall have a minimum surface treatment width of 15 feet, but shall not be provided in one-family and two-family residential developments unless the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys. 
                  (12)  Street right-of-way widths. All roads must be constructed to any and all adopted county engineering standards. Minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as follows: 
                  a.  Curb and gutter type construction. 

                   
                  b.  Shoulder-type lane construction. 

                   
                  c.  Inverted crown type construction. 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  When inverted crown is used the minimum grade shall not be less than one-half of one percent. 
                  Except for local street, roadway widths shown do not provide for on-street parking; service lanes are intended only for loading and unloading of passengers and goods, and for disabled vehicles and not for the storage of vehicles. 
                  Right-of-way (henceforth referred to as R/W) width listed is for only that portion of the typical section between the limits indicated in diagram. Sloping rights of additional R/W will be required for cut and fill slopes outside these limits; these future slope areas beyond indicated R/W limits should also be kept clear of development until slopes have been constructed. 
                  R/W widths greater than the minimum are encouraged because they make for a safer, more aesthetic and more comfortable facility and permit future roadway widening without disrupting abutting property. 
                  (13)  Sight distance for vertical curves. Where vertical curves are used, the minimum sight distance shall be as follows: 

                   
                  (14)  Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees occurs in the alignment of a marginal access or minor street or road, a curve of reasonable radius shall be introduced. A curve shall be introduced at any change in direction of a collector, industrial or commercial service street or major thoroughfare. On major thoroughfares, a centerline radius of curvature shall be determined by the state department of transportation or county engineer. On collector, industrial or commercial service streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 150 feet unless the topography of the land to be subdivided makes this impractical. 
                  (15)  Street grades. Grades on major thoroughfares should be established by the state department of transportation or county engineer. Grades on collector streets shall not exceed eight percent unless topographic conditions made this impractical. Grades on minor residential streets shall not exceed 15 percent, unless topographic conditions make this impractical. All streets should have a minimum grade of not less than one-half of one percent. 
                  (16)  Access to arterial roads. When a subdivision is proposed with frontage along an existing arterial road or state numbered highway, every attempt must be made to provide an access road or frontage road for direct access to the proposed lots. The planning commission shall evaluate this requirement in an attempt to reduce the number and frequency of curb cuts along arterial roads and state numbered highways.

                  Sec. 66-225. - Lots. 
                  All lots shall meet the minimum lot size, lot width, setback, and any other requirements established for the zoning district in which the lot is located. 
                  (1)  Orientation of lot lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to street lines. 
                  (2)  Frontage. Each lot shall have street frontage and shall have access to said street frontage, except as otherwise permitted by this chapter for intra-family land transfers. 
                  (3)  Flag lots. 
                  a.  Intent. Flag lots, as defined in this chapter, are strongly discouraged. However, subdivisions designed with one or more flag lots may be necessary due to the configuration of the lot to be subdivided or to achieve the maximum yield of lots without necessitating the construction of a new or extended street. 
                  b.  Number limited. The zoning administrator in the case of minor subdivisions and the planning commission in the case of major subdivisions shall have due cause to deny any plat that proposes more than one flag lot for every five lots in the subdivision. 
                  c.  Panhandle length restriction. No flag lot shall be allowed to be platted that has a "panhandle" portion (i.e., portion that does not meet the required lot width) that is more than 800 feet in length. 
                  d.  Adequate lot width at building line required. No flag lot shall be approved which fails to meet the lot width required for the zoning district in which the lot is located at the proposed building line. 
                  e.  Prohibition of abutting flag lots. No more than two flag lots shall abut one another in any subdivision. 
                  (4)  Right-of-way dedication. When a major subdivision abuts an existing county road right-of-way, the subdivider shall dedicate and deed land sufficient to provide a 40 foot right-of-way from the centerline of said existing county road. Said dedication shall be required to be shown on the final plat for said subdivision, along with the appropriate dedication statement on the plat.

                  (5)  Topography. Topography of the site by contours at vertical intervals of not more than two feet. 
                  (6)  Parking. The location and dimensions of off-street parking and loading space and the means of ingress and egress to and from such space. All housing developments for more than three families shall provide 1.5 parking spaces per bedroom. 
                  (7)  Drainage. The location and size of all proposed utilities and storm drainage facilities. 
                  (8)  Other information. Such other information as the planning commission may deem necessary because of the physical characteristics peculiar to the particular development. 
                  (9)  Enforcement of planned development requirements. No building permit shall be issued and no connection to a public water system or public sewer system shall be made until the plans for the planned development have been approved by the planning commission and so noted on prints of the development plan. 
                  (10)  Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in this chapter, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the planning commission that the street, parcel and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be observed:

The storage, processing or parking of all inoperable vehicles within a salvage yard shall be no closer than 350 feet of any property line. All salvage yards shall be fully enclosed by an opaque wall or fence not less than eight feet in height. The materials and design of such fence shall be approved by the planning commission and shall be compatible with the use of the adjoining properties. 
                  (o)  Sanitary landfills.

                  (7)  The fill area shall be entirely enclosed, exclusive of driveways, at its external boundaries by a wall or fence and an evergreen hedge not less than seven feet in height. The wall or hedge shall not be constructed or planted within the required setback. 
                  (8)  The development shall include a traffic impact statement concerning traffic flow and the structural reliability of the pavement of the existing transportation network most affected (from the site to an arterial street along the primary access route to the site). The traffic impact statement shall include a count of the existing traffic by vehicle type and size and a projection of traffic and a projection of traffic, for when the facility is in full operation, by vehicle type and size for that portion of transportation network most affected by this use. An assessment of how the change in the vehicle mix will affect the pavement reliability including the collector street. Provision for traffic access to the site must be found to provide a safe access and without unreasonable adverse impact upon the transportation network based upon the information supplied and the requirements set forth in this section. 
                  (9)  The hours of operation of the landfill shall be limited. No land filling shall be permitted before 6:00 a.m. or after 7:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday only. A convenience center shall be established for use while the landfill is closed. 
                  (10)  The developer shall obtain a report from a professional geologist, engineer, or other duly qualified individual that affirmatively demonstrates that the proposed development will not unreasonably alter natural drainageways; will not unreasonably affect runoff/infiltration relationships; has adequate provisions to control erosion and sedimentation; and will have no unreasonable adverse effect on surface water or groundwater quality. 
                  (11)  The developer shall submit evidence that affirmatively demonstrates he has the financial capacity to undertake the proposed development including information such as cost estimates of the development; time schedule for construction and for satisfying pollution abatement measures; a letter from a financial institution indicating a commitment to provide a specified amount of funds; copies of bank statements; a performance bond to ensure that the air and water pollution control plans are completed as approved; and other information requested by the planning commission. 
                  (p)  Signs and advertising devices. The use and placement of signs, billboards, and other outdoor advertising devices shall be in accordance with the Screven County Sign Ordinance codified as Article 18 of Appendix A of the Code.

                  Sec. 302. - Districts explained. 
                  Districts are areas of land within Screven County to which different development requirements and standards are applied. These differences are intended to promote the separation of incompatible uses, encourage sound land use patterns, and retain the character of the community. Although this ordinance establishes the locations of districts as indicated on the official zoning map, a district may be changed in the future in accordance with the provisions of section 414. All uses not permitted within a particular zoning district as defined in that section are specifically prohibited. 
                  Sec. 303. - Official Zoning Map, Screven County, Georgia (official map). 
                  The Official Zoning Map, Screven County, Georgia, is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this zoning ordinance. Any reference to the "official map" in this ordinance refers to the Official Zoning Map, Screven County, Georgia. The geographic location of districts is determined by the official map, as well as any amendments adopted by the board of commissioners. 
                  Sec. 304. - Identification, alteration, and replacement of the official map. 
                  A.  The official map shall be comprised of a set of tax maps, which together comprise the official map. Upon adoption by the board of commissioners, each tax map which is part of the official map shall be signed by the clerk of the board of commissioners and shall bear the seal of the county or that of a notary public under the following words: "This certifies that this is the Official Zoning Map, Screven County, Georgia, referred to in Article 3 of the Zoning Ordinance of Screven County, Georgia," together with the date of adoption of the ordinance. 
                  B.  The official map may be amended under the procedure set forth in section 414 of this ordinance. Any amendment to the official map is an amendment to this ordinance. Any amendment involving a change of a zoning district shall be entered on the official map when an amendment has been approved by the board of commissioners. The entry showing the amendment to the official map shall be placed upon the property which is the subject of the amendment and shall show the date of the amendment, the zoning file number, and the zoning district adopted as an amendment. 
                  C.  Alterations to the official map may be made only by the procedures contained in sections 414 and 304 of this ordinance. 
                  D.  The official map shall be on display in the office of the zoning administrator. 
                  E.  If the official map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the board of commissioners may adopt a new official map which will replace the previous official map. The new official map is identified as such in the same manner as described above in this section. When the new official map is adopted, a notation may be made on the previous official map that it is no longer valid, indicating the date that the new official map was adopted, as a reference aid. The previous official map should be preserved, if it has not been lost or destroyed, for possible future reference. 
                  Sec. 305. - (Reserved). 
                  Sec. 306. - (Reserved). 
                  Sec. 307. - Zoning district boundaries. 
                  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the exact location of the boundary of a zoning district shown on the official map, the following guidelines will be used in establishing the exact location of the boundary: 
                  A.  Where a zoning district boundary line as appearing on the official map divides a single lot that was a single lot at the time of the enactment of this ordinance, the requirements for the zoning district shall extend only as far as the zoning district boundary line. In order to place the entire lot in one zoning district, the property must be rezoned in accordance with the application and amendment requirements. In such circumstances, the application fee is waived. 
                  B.  Where a zoning district boundary is indicated as approximately following a municipal limits or county line, the municipal limits or county line is the boundary. 
                  C.  Where a zoning district boundary is indicated as approximately following a property line or such line extended, the line or lines extended is the boundary. 
                  D.  Where a zoning district boundary is indicated as approximately following the centerline of a stream bed, such a centerline is the boundary. 
                  E.  Where a zoning district boundary is indicated as approximately parallel to the centerline of a street, road, railroad, or the right-of-way of such a facility, the zoning district boundary is parallel to the line and at a distance from it as indicated by scale on the official map. 
                  Sec. 308. - Relationship between official map and Screven County Comprehensive Plan. 
                  A.  The Screven County Comprehensive Plan was adopted by the Board of Commissioners of Screven County. It provides the best possible indication of desirable land use patterns that will meet projected future demand for land uses of various types. The Screven County Comprehensive Plan supplies a body of information upon which decisions on future development may be made that are guided by sound planning principles. It contains a future land use map, which shows suitable areas for various types of land uses. Although the board of commissioners is not bound by the comprehensive plan or future land use map, these documents serve as a guide for establishing appropriate zoning districts. 
                  B.  The zoning districts contained on the official map carry standards which must be met by all new development and construction in the county. 
                  ARTICLE 4. - GENERAL PROCEDURES.

                  A.  A nonconforming use or structure shall not be changed to another nonconforming use or structure. 
                  B.  A nonconforming residential or agricultural structure, provided the use therein is a permitted use, may be enlarged, provided [that] it is an improvement, subject to building codes and regulations, to come into conformity with the zoning district development standards, after the date of adoption of this ordinance or the adoption of any amendments thereto. 
                  C.  A nonconforming use shall not be reestablished after discontinuance for six months regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon. 
                  D.  Any intended nonconforming use for which a vested right was acquired prior to the adoption of this ordinance or the adoption of an amendment thereto shall be prohibited unless such is actually commenced within one year of the adoption of this ordinance or the adoption of an amendment thereto regardless of the intent or expectation to commence or abandon such nonconforming use. 
                  E.  A nonconforming structure shall not be rebuilt, altered, or repaired except as provided herein: 
                  1.  If the structure is altered or repaired, said alterations or repairs shall be an improvement and in conformity with the building codes in force at the time of said alteration or repair; provided, however, that said alteration or repair shall not extend or enlarge the structure being altered or repaired. 
                  2.  If the structure is totally rebuilt, the replacement structure shall conform with all the requirements of this ordinance, except as to the district; provided, however, [that] said replacement structure may not occupy an area greater than the replaced structure.

Such fences and/or walls shall be at least six feet in height, but no greater than eight feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot lines of the adjoining properties. When hedges or natural plantings are used (together with the fence prescribed) to form the required screening, the minimum sufficient opacity shall be deemed to require no less than three feet of plantings and/or hedge in the area immediately adjacent to the fence, measured along the ground surface from the fence to the inside border of said plantings and/or hedge plantings. Hedges of comparable natural plantings shall be of such variety that an average height of at least six feet could be expected by normal growth within no later than two years from the time of planting. The building official shall make determination of the degree of satisfactory completion of required screening according to a common standard; the building official decisions in each instance may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission. 
                  Sec. 407A. - Minimum yard setback. 
                  Wherever this ordinance requires an minimum setback between a property line and a building line, unless otherwise indicated, this shall mean the required minimum distance between any point on the property line to the nearest point on the corresponding building line, i.e., the minimum front building line shall be at least the required minimum distance from the front property line, the rear building line shall be at least the required minimum distance from the rear property line, etc. 
                  Sec. 408. - Building permit required. 
                  A.  The developer or other person wishing to do any of the following must first apply to the building official for a building permit: 
                  1.  Excavation or filling of a lot for the construction of a building. 
                  2.  Erection, movement, extension, or enlargement of a building. 
                  3.  Installation of a manufactured home or industrialized building. 
                  B.  No electrical service will be made available to the site of new construction until a building permit is secured. 
                  C.  The building permit must be applied for either by the owner of the land upon which the propose building or alteration is to be located, or by the contractor doing the work. 
                  D.  Any contractor, other than the owner who will perform work which is the object of a building permit, shall present his state license to the building official before the permit shall be issued. 
                  E.  The applicant may obtain a building permit application from the building official. He should complete the application form and submit it to the building official, together with any supporting documentation which the building official may specify. 
                  F.  No application will be accepted from any person who is in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for a building permit is, at the time of such an application, determined by the building official to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the building official will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation and ceases to be in violation. The applicant must notify the building official that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the zoning administrator as to the violation. 
                  G.  When the applicant has ceased to be in violation of this ordinance, the building official will then accept the application for [a] building permit. 
                  H.  Before a building permit is issued by the building official, the Screven County Health Department must approve the proposed water supply and sewage disposal facilities required in connection with the proposed building or structure. In areas served by a public water and sewage system, the health department may elect to waive the requirement for approval. After study of the site of a proposed use, the health department may require for health reasons that all or any portion of the site not be used for the intended purpose. The health department may also set a minimum lot size larger than that required by this ordinance. The Screven County Health Department will either approve or disapprove the water and sewer facilities within 30 days of receipt of the application from the building official, providing a written decision, including reasons for the decision. 
                  I.  An existing use which is altered or extended must meet applicable Screven County building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a building permit for the extension or alteration of an existing use, the building official will inspect the use and determine what, if anything, is needed to bring the use into conformance with the applicable building codes and development regulations before a building permit may be issued. 
                  J.  The building official is in charge of issuing building permits. The building permit will be issued if, upon review of the application, the building official is satisfied that the proposed project can meet the requirements of this ordinance and all other applicable ordinances. The building official may require the submission of additional information in order to determine if the proposed project meets the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  K.  If the building official determines that the proposed project as presented in the building permit application will not satisfy the requirements of this ordinance, he will not issue a building permit. He will notify the applicant in writing within ten working days of the submission of the application, stating reasons for the refusal. The applicant will then need to confer with the building official to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a building permit. 
                  L.  Construction on an approved project must start within six months from the date of issue of the building permit, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the project is desired at a future date. If construction has begun on an approved project and then ceases before the project is completed, construction must be restarted within 12 months from the time that it was stopped, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the project is desired to resume at a future date. Records of building permit applications and supporting materials will be maintained by the building official. 
                  M.  All newly constructed buildings, as well as additions, extensions or enlargements of structures must comply with all building codes in effect in Screven County. The building official will explain the procedures and timing of inspections to determine if work meets applicable codes. 
                  N.  The building official may revoke any building permit where there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact or condition in the application or plans on which the permit was based, and upon such revocation, all construction, improvements or alterations as authorized by such permit or approval, shall cease until a valid building permit is issued. 
                  O.  No person or entity is entitled to rely on any permit, document, promise, or assurance given or issued by Screven County, unless it is consistent with and in compliance with local ordinances. 
                  Sec. 409. - Certificate of occupancy required. 
                  A.  [A] certificate of occupancy is required before a structure for which a building permit has been issued may be occupied or used. The certificate of occupancy must be signed by the zoning administrator and attest that to the best of his knowledge all requirements of this ordinance have been met. The owner/contractor will then receive the certificate of occupancy to be used as confirmation that he has complied with the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  B.  The zoning administrator will issue the certificate of occupancy upon notification by the building official that all applicable building codes and other uniform development standards and ordinances have been met. However, if the building official finds that all requirements of such ordinances have not yet been met when the owner/contractor seeks a certificate of occupancy, the zoning administrator will not issue the certificate of occupancy. The zoning administrator will notify the owner/contractor within ten working days, stating reasons for the refusal. The owner/contractor will then need to confer with the zoning administrator to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a certificate of occupancy. 
                  Sec. 410. - Appealing an action of the zoning administrator or building official. 
                  A.  If the zoning administrator or building official executes an action which the aggrieved party believes to be contrary to this ordinance, that action may be appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date on which the action by the zoning administrator or building official was taken. 
                  B.  The planning and zoning commission has jurisdiction for hearing appeals concerning actions of the zoning administrator or building official related to this ordinance. Applications for appeal may be obtained from and submitted to the zoning administrator, who will transmit them to the planning and zoning commission for its consideration. 
                  C.  When an action of the zoning administrator or building official is appealed, all construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however, the building official may feel that the stopping of such construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action will cause imminent peril to life or property. Then, the building official may certify to the planning and zoning commission that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action is allowed to continue unless the construction is halted by the planning and zoning commission or a restraining order is granted by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  D.  When an application for appeal of an action of the zoning administrator or building official is received, the planning and zoning commission shall set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Screven County at least 15 days before the hearing. In addition, the parties to the appeal will be notified of the date of the hearing by the planning and zoning commission by certified mail, with return receipt requested, and postmarked at least 15 days before the hearing. Any person may appear at the hearing, or have a representative attend instead. 
                  E.  All persons who wish to address the planning and zoning commission at a hearing concerning an appeal under consideration by the planning and zoning commission shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the zoning administrator prior to the commencement of the hearing. 
                  F.  The chairman or his designee will read the proposed appeal under consideration, and the departmental reviews pertaining thereto, if any, prior to receiving public input on the proposed appeal. Appeals shall be called in the order in which they were filed. 
                  G.  The chairman or his designee shall then call each person who has signed up to speak on the appeal then before the planning and zoning commission in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except that the applicant who shall speak first. Prior to speaking, the speaker will identify himself or herself and state his or her current address. Only those persons who signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless two-thirds of the members of the planning and zoning commission present at the hearing allow the person to speak to the appeal. 
                  H.  Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed appeal under consideration and shall address his remarks only to the member of the planning and zoning commission. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or from discussing facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed appeal under consideration. The chair may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection. 
                  I.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the chair from conducting the hearing in an orderly and decorous manner to ensure that the public hearing on the appeal is conducted in a fair and orderly manner. 
                  J.  The planning and zoning commission will make a decision concerning the appeal and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. Any person aggrieved by a decision by the planning and zoning commission may petition the Screven County Board of Commissioners. In exercising its powers, the board of commissioners may, in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the planning commission. 
                  K.  The concurring vote of a majority of the members present of the board of commissioners shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the planning commission, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance. 
                  L.  On all appeals brought before the board of commissioners, said board shall inform, in writing, all the parties involved of its decisions, and the decision shall be recorded in the minutes. Recourse from a decision by the board of commissioners shall be by appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days of the date of the meeting in which the decision is announced; provided, however, that an applicant has exhausted all remedies afforded by this ordinance, including consideration of variances or conditional uses. 
                  M.  The planning and zoning commission and the board of commissioners may establish such other rules as may be provident and in accordance with due process for the conduct of their hearings which are not inconsistent with those rules set forth in this section. 
                  Sec. 411. - Variances. 
                  A.  A variance is a permit, issued by the planning and zoning commission, which allows use of a parcel of land in a way that varies from requirements for the district in which the property is located. A variance may be granted only in an individual case where a hardship would result if all of the requirements of this ordinance were applied stringently to a particular piece of property. A hardship means that a permitted use of a lot is not reasonable if all of the requirements of this ordinance are to be met. A hardship may exist for medical reasons which would permit the temporary placement of a manufactured home, meeting applicable development standards, on the same parcel as the original principle dwelling. Such temporary dwelling shall be placed behind the principle and within 300 feet of the principle dwelling. Such temporary dwelling shall provide living quarters for an infirm family member or to provide living quarters for a family member or certified/registered assisted living employee to aid in the care of one or more infirm family members living in the original principle dwelling. Variances approved for medical hardship cases shall be reviewed annually by the planning and zoning commission. When the medical hardship ceases to exist, the owner of the principle dwelling shall notify the zoning administrator. Such manufactured home shall be removed within 30 days, or subject to owner of the principle dwelling to fines and penalties as outlined in section 418. The hardship cannot be self-created such as: 
                  1.  A lot purchased with knowledge of an existing restriction. 
                  2.  A claim of hardship in terms of prospective sales. 
                  3.  An expressed economic need requiring a variance, when such a need can be met in other ways which would not require a variance. 
                  B.  A variance shall not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes of this ordinance. 
                  C.  When a variance is issued, the spirit of this ordinance must be observed and the public safety and welfare secured. A variance may be granted only for permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property in question is located. 
                  D.  The developer or owner wishing to request a variance must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning and zoning commission or board of commissioners may also propose a variance. However, the power to approve a variance rests with the planning and zoning commission, except that in consideration of a rezoning of property from one zoning district to another, the board of commissioners may approve a variance in connection with its approval of a conditional rezoning. 
                  E.  Application for a variance may be made with the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator will take the required information and transmit it to the planning and zoning commission for its consideration. If an applicant for a variance is, at the time of such application, operating a use which requires a variance without having received variance approval, and/or is determined by the zoning administrator to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, as it pertains to the application in question, then the fee for processing the variance application shall be two times the normal variance application fee and the applicant shall cease operations or activities while the variance application is pending. The zoning administrator shall not process any application from that applicant as it pertains to the property in question until the applicant remedies the violation and ceases to be in violation, to the extent practical as determined by the zoning administrator. If the variance application is approved and it remedies the violation, the applicant may continue the activity or operation. If the variance application is not approved, the applicant shall be prevented from continuing the activity or operation applied for until otherwise compliant with the county zoning ordinance. 
                  F.  When the applicant has ceased to be in violation of this ordinance, the zoning administrator will then accept the application for variance. 
                  G.  When an application for a variance is received, the planning and zoning commission will set a time and place for a public hearing on the variance. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Screven County at least 15 days before the hearing. Such notice will state the application number, owner's name, property location, its area, time, place and subject of the hearing. At least 15 days before the public hearing, notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing will be sent to the appellant or petitioner in writing by U.S. mail to his last known address. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant's file. The zoning administrator shall post a sign at least two feet by three feet in size in a conspicuous place on the property at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing before the planning and zoning commission. The sign must set forth the subject of the hearing, date, time and place of the scheduled public hearing. 
                  H.  All persons who wish to address the planning and zoning commission at a hearing concerning an appeal under consideration by the planning and zoning commission shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the zoning administrator prior to the commencement of the hearing. 
                  I.  The chairman or his designee will read the proposed appeal under consideration, and the departmental reviews pertaining thereto, if any, prior to receiving public input on the proposed appeal. Appeals shall be called in the order in which they were filed. 
                  J.  The chairman or his designee shall then call each person who has signed up to speak on the appeal then before the planning and zoning commission in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except that the applicant who shall speak first. Prior to speaking, the speaker will identify himself or herself and state his or her current address. Only those persons who signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless two-thirds of the members of the planning and zoning commission present at the hearing allow the person to speak to the appeal. 
                  K.  Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed appeal under consideration and shall address his remarks only to the member of the planning and zoning commission. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or from discussing facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed appeal under consideration. The chair may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection. 
                  L.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the chair from conducting the hearing in an orderly and decorous manner to assure that the public hearing on the appeal is conducted in a fair and orderly manner. 
                  M.  The planning and zoning commission will make a decision concerning the variance and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. 
                  N.  The planning and zoning commission may impose any other conditions which must be complied with by the applicant to compensate for the requirements varied from. 
                  O.  Where a variance is granted for a construction activity requiring a building permit, the building permit must be obtained and construction must begin within six months of the issuance of the variance. Otherwise, the variance expires after six months. 
                  P.  Any person aggrieved by a decision of the planning and zoning commission on an application for a variance may appeal the decision of the planning and zoning commission to the Screven County Board of Commissioners which shall hear such appeal pursuant to the same procedures established for consideration of a variance by the planning and zoning commission, except that no additional public hearing will be required. 
                  (Ord. of 11-9-2004(2), § 4) 
                  Sec. 412. - Developments of regional impact (DRI). 
                  A.  Local zoning provision to allow for DRI review. For new developments proposed within Screven County which meet or exceed the minimum threshold identified in the department of community affair's Procedures and Guidelines for the review of developments of regional impact (DRI), the county will comply with these intergovernmental review procedures. The county shall be allowed up to a maximum of 30 days to complete the review process for large development projects that are likely to create impacts in other local jurisdictions. The county will not take any official action to further any such developments until the DRI Review Process is completed or a maximum of 30 day has transpired from the date the completed DRI request for review form was forwarded to the regional development center. 
                  Sec. 413. - Conditional use. 
                  A.  Some zoning districts permit certain uses only upon approval of the board of commissioners after receiving a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. These uses are identified in this ordinance as conditional uses and such uses are allowed only under the circumstances specified in this ordinance. 
                  B.  The developer or owner wishing to request a conditional use must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning and zoning commission or board of commissioners may also propose a conditional use. However, the power to approve a conditional use rests with the board of commissioners. 
                  C.  Application for a conditional use shall be filed with the zoning administrator. If an applicant for conditional use is operating a use which requires a conditional use without conditional use approval, and/or is determined by the zoning administrator to be in violation of the zoning ordinance as it pertains to the application in question, then the fee for processing the conditional use shall be two times the normal conditional use permit fee and the conditional use applicant shall cease operations of the conditional use while the conditional use application is pending. The zoning administrator shall not process any application from that applicant as it pertains to the property in question until the applicant remedies the violation and ceases to be in violation, to the extent practical as determined by the zoning administrator. If the conditional use is approved and it remedies the violation, the conditional use applicant may continue the activity or operation. If the conditional use is not approved, the applicant shall be prevented from continuing the activity or operation applied for until otherwise compliant with the the county zoning ordinance. 
                  D.  When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by [of subsection] C above, the zoning administrator will then accept the application for conditional use. 
                  E.  When an application for a conditional use is filed, it shall be considered under the same procedure as required for an amendment to the official zoning map under the provisions of section 414, except as otherwise provided by the provisions of this section. 
                  F.  The planning and zoning commission and board of commissioners will consider the following standards in arriving at a decision on the conditional use: 
                  1.  It must not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties, or to the general neighborhood; it must not adversely affect the health or safety of residents or workers. 
                  2.  It must not be that any possible depreciating effects and damages to the neighboring properties are greater than the benefits or need for the conditional use. 
                  3.  It must not adversely affect existing uses, and it must be proposed to be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of the use. 
                  4.  It must meet all other requirements of this ordinance. 
                  G.  The planning and zoning commission may recommend and board of commissioners may impose any additional conditions and development standards, along with the grant of a conditional use, as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of the workers and residents and to protect the surrounding landowners and neighborhoods. 
                  H.  The board of commissioners is not bound by the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, and after consideration of the standards set forth in subsection G, the board of commissioners may grant or deny the application for a conditional use and, if granted, establish such additional conditions and developments standards at it deems appropriate to satisfy the standards in subsection G. 
                  I.  If the building official finds that any restrictions upon which a conditional use was granted is not being complied with, it may suspend the permit for the conditional use until such time as the applicant brings the conditional use into compliance with the restrictions imposed by the board of commissioners. Only work upon the conditional use may be allowed during suspension of the permit which is necessary to bring the conditional use into compliance with the restrictions imposed by the board of commissioners. 
                  J.  The chairman or his designee shall then call each person who has signed up to speak on the appeal then before the planning and zoning commission in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except that the applicant who shall speak first.

The chair may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection. 
                  L.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the chair from conducting the hearing in an orderly and decorous manner to assure that the public hearing on the appeal is conducted in a fair and orderly manner. 
                  M.  No application for a conditional use shall be considered for six months following denial of the same or substantially same request.

                  Sec. 414. - Amendments. 
                  A.  Any land owner may request that the official map be amended from the existing another as it applies to the owner's property. Also, any person affected by this zoning ordinance may propose an amendment to the text of this zoning ordinance under the provisions of this section. As used in this section, the term "amendment" shall mean both a change to the official map and a change to the text of this ordinance unless otherwise indicated. The developer or owner wishing to request an amendment of the official map must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing under the owner's signature.

                  B.  Application for an amendment may be made with the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator will take the required information and transmit it to the planning and zoning commission for its consideration.

The zoning administrator shall not process any application from that applicant as it pertains to the property in question until the applicant remedies the violation and ceases to be in violation, to the extent practical as determined by the zoning administrator. If the amendment application is approved and it remedies the violation, the applicant may continue the activity or operation. If the amendment is not approved, the applicant shall be prevented from continuing the activity or operation applied for until otherwise compliant with the county zoning ordinance. 
                  C.  An applicant requesting an amendment to the official map shall provide the zoning administrator the following:

                  "(a)  It is the declared policy of the state to conserve, protect, and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural land and facilities for the production of food and other agricultural products. When nonagricultural land uses extend into agricultural areas, agricultural operations often become the subject of nuisance actions. As a result, agricultural facilities are sometimes forced to cease operations. Many others are discouraged from making investments in farm improvements or adopting new technology or methods. It is the purpose of this Code section to reduce losses of the state's agricultural resources by limiting the circumstances under which agricultural facilities and operations may be deemed to be a nuisance." 
                  The Code further states: 
                  "(c)  No agricultural facility of any agricultural operation at an agricultural facility shall become a nuisance, either public or private, as a result of changed conditions in or around the locality of such agricultural facility if the agricultural facility has been in operation for one year or more. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply when a nuisance results from the negligent, improper, or illegal operation of any agricultural facility. 
                  "(d)  For the purposes of this Code section, the established date of operation is the date on which an agricultural operation commenced operation. If the physical facilities of the agricultural operation are subsequently expanded or new technology adopted, the established date of operation for each change is not a separately and independently established date of operation and the commencement of the expanded operation does not divest the agricultural operation of a previously established date of operation."

                  4.  No building permits will be issued by the building official until the development plan has been approved by the board of commissioners. 
                  D.  Issuance of building permits. The building official will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations. (See section 408.) 
                  E.  Revision of development plan after approval of plan. 
                  1.  Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the planning and zoning commission; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan. 
                  2.  Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners after receipt of recommendations from the planning and zoning commission in accordance with the provisions of sections 414 and 1702. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development.

                  ARTICLE 9. - PCFD—PLANNED COMMERCIAL FARM DISTRICT 

                  Sec. 901. - Statement of purpose. 
                  The planned commercial farm district (PCFD) shall be represented by large district areas of not less than 35 acres that are devoted to intensive agricultural production in the areas of food crops, fiber crops, animal feed, poultry, livestock or commercial timber production. Individual farms within the district shall contain at least five acres. Areas within this zone are not intended to be used for small scale farming, gardening, small poultry operation or idle pasture land; uses which would more appropriately be located in other zoning districts. The land should be in use for good faith farming or agricultural uses worthy of protection and preservation. 
                  Districts designated as PCFD may result in odors, dust, noise or other effects that may not be compatible with single-lot residential development. Specific setback and buffer requirements designed for PCFD shall apply to minimize the potential adverse effects of farm uses. 
                  In order for a parcel to be included in the PCF District, the parcel must have qualified for and be under the provisions of House Bill 230, the Preferential Agricultural Assessment. The parcel will also meet PCFD requirements if the parcel exceeds 2,000 acres, and if the landowner already has 2,000 acres under the provisions of House Bill 230. 
                  If, after a tract of land is designated as [a] PCF district, the land is not actively used for intensive commercial agricultural uses, the county may, at its discretion, initiate procedures for a zoning review and possible rezoning of the property to more appropriate zoning district. An automatic review of the zoning will occur at the end of the first year after the date of the designation of a tract of land to PCFD. 
                  Sec. 902. - Permitted uses. 
                  A.  The following principal uses are permitted in PCF districts:

                  --- (2) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. of Sept. 22, 2009(1) amended former Art. 10, §§ 1001—1005, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. 10 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. (2) of Nov. 9, 2004, § 19. 

                  Sec. 1001. - Purpose. 
                  This zoning district is intended to provide standards and regulations for manufactured home parks, recreational vehicle parks, and campgrounds, which provide for affordable permanent and temporary housing and seasonal recreational developments, respectively. Manufactured home parks provide for the leasing of spaces for the placement of manufactured homes, owned or rented by tenants. This zoning district also provides for planned residential communities in the form of parks, campgrounds, camp sites, and spaces. A manufactured home park is different from a residential subdivision in that the individual spaces for manufactured homes or spaces or campsites for recreational vehicles are leased rather than platted and sold. By requiring less land per home or vehicle space, manufactured home parks are built at densities greater than those for detached dwellings. Service facilities such as laundry and leasing office are often planned and provided as a part of the park development. 
                  It is also the intent of this article to provide for the creation of new and expansion or modification of existing recreational vehicle parks and campgrounds in unincorporated areas of Screven County that meet the needs and protect the interests of users, the recreational vehicle industry, and adjacent landowners. To assure the compatibility of planned manufactured home communities, recreational vehicle parks, and campgrounds with adjacent and nearby land uses, this article establishes development standards while providing for flexible designs.

                  Sec. 1003. - Development standards for PMHC districts. 
                  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the development standards of this section shall apply to all permitted uses. No permitted use shall be permitted until and unless a major development plan shall have been approved by the planning commission and the zoning administrator in accordance with section 66-111(b) of the Screven County Land Development Regulations. The zoning administrator shall not issue a permit for a use permitted in a PMHC zoning district unless it is in conformity with all the provisions of this article. The standards in this section shall not apply to recreational vehicle parks designed to serve and serving three or less vehicles. 
                  1.  Site conditions. Planned manufactured home communities shall be sited on land that is not subject to hazards such as flooding, erosion, land subsidence, and areas with possible insect or rodent infestation. Recreational vehicle parks should observe similar site condition limitations. The condition of the soil, ground water level, drainage, rock formations, and topography must be appropriate for the use, to ensure that no hazards to the property or to the health and safety of the occupants occurs. 
                  2.  Site planning. Planning for manufactured home communities and recreational vehicle parks should be adapted to individual site conditions and the type of use or uses served, reflect advances in site planning techniques, and be adapted to the trends in the design of the manufactured home or recreational vehicle itself. Site planning and improvements shall provide for facilities and amenities appropriate to the needs of the occupants, safe, comfortable and sanitary use by the occupants under all weather conditions, and practical and efficient operation and maintenance of all facilities at reasonable costs. The street and block pattern for the community or park shall be designed to attain proper sizes and shapes of manufactured home and/or recreational vehicle spaces so as to provide desirable areas and to reduce excessive length of street construction without impairing convenient circulation and access. 
                  3.  Minimum site area, site frontage, access, and minimum width. Planned manufactured home communities shall contain a minimum area of five acres. Properties containing planned manufactured home communities shall have a minimum of 200 feet of property frontage on a public street, and directly access the public street with a minimum of 200 feet of property frontage. Planned manufactured home communities shall have a minimum lot width of 200 feet throughout the entire depth of the developed portion of the property. Recreational vehicle parks are not subject to the standards of this paragraph. 
                  4.  Perimeter buffer or landscape screen. A minimum 20-foot wide buffer, where natural vegetation exists and provides a more or less opaque screen, or where no natural vegetation forming an opaque screen exists, a minimum 20-foot wide landscape strip with evergreen trees that will grow to a height of at least six feet within three years, shall be installed and maintained around the entire perimeter of a planned manufactured home community, except for approved access and utility crossings. Buffers for recreational vehicle parks shall be as determined by the planning and zoning commission on a case by case basis. 
                  5.  Open space and recreational areas. A planned manufactured home community serving 20 or more dwellings, and for recreational vehicle parks serving 30 or more vehicles, there shall be a minimum of 20 percent of the site area dedicated to open space and passive or active recreation, including the required perimeter buffer or landscape screen. 
                  6.  Community services. As part of the development plan review process, the developer may propose and the county may approve one or more other structures for manufactured home or recreational vehicle occupants, such as laundries, storage, garages, and a park leasing or management office. Any structure that draws its trade from outside the park boundaries is prohibited. 
                  7.  Interior access roads, addresses, and signs. The road system within the planned manufactured home community or recreational vehicle park shall be designed to meet the requirements of the county fire marshal and the traveling public to include the following. All interior roads shall be private but constructed to provide fire apparatus access. Roads within planned manufactured home communities shall be paved. Within recreational vehicle parks, roads, access driveways, and parking spaces shall be surfaced to provide drainage and to avoid dust; such surfacing may consist of cinder, gravel, or comparable non-dust creating, semi-permeable, all-weather surfaces. Signs shall be installed as required by the county road department and approved in the development plan review process. 
                  8.  Road specifications. One-way interior roads shall be constructed with a minimum surface width of 12 feet, with three feet of shoulder on each side, and shall be designated "no parking."

                  (a)  Water. All recreational vehicle parks and campgrounds shall meet the following standards: A water supply serving a recreational vehicle park or campground shall conform to the requirements of the county health official, as now enacted or hereafter amended. Where an existing public water supply of satisfactory quantity and quality is reasonably available, the health official may require connection to that supply for all domestic water purposes at the recreational vehicle park or campground. Recreational vehicle parks shall provide either individual water connections at campsites or spaces, or a centralized water source with adequate quantity of storage. Recreational vehicle parks shall provide a central sewage disposal dumping site, meeting applicable health rules. Development of a recreational vehicle park or campground without an approved domestic water supply shall require written approval from the health official. 
                  (b)  Sewage disposal and public restrooms. All recreational vehicle parks and campgrounds shall discharge sewage and gray water to sewage disposal systems approved by the county health official. Recreational vehicles may be connected to a public sanitary sewer system or an on-site sewage system if approved by the owner/operator and the health official. Connection to a public sewer system may be required where reasonably available. Unless each camping space allows for connection of camping units to potable water and waste water disposal systems, there shall be at least one sewage pump-out station conveniently located with access from the service driveway and with easy ingress and egress for recreational vehicles in each recreational vehicle park or campground that is designed to accommodate recreational vehicles. For camping spaces not connected to a sewage disposal system, there shall be clearly identified and approved dumping stations and facilities for the disposal of gray water convenient to each camping space. Alternate sewage disposal systems may be installed in lieu of conventional means of sewage disposal, subject to approval from the health official. Minimum sanitary facilities, including toilets, urinals, and hand washing sinks, for new recreational vehicle parks and campgrounds shall be provided as required by the health official. Public restrooms shall be constructed to meet all applicable building codes. 
                  (c)  Solid waste disposal. One or more solid waste collection areas shall be required. The number of spaces shall be used to determine the number of dumpsters required. The locations shall be proposed by the applicant and as approved in the development review process; provided, however, that the location shall be reasonably close to the entrance of the development at a county road. Collection areas having more than one container may require screening with a sight-obscuring fence. The development applicant shall pay a fee to the county for purchase of new dumpsters serving the development, and the dumpsters required to serve the development shall be rented from the county.

Off-street parking and minimum yards are required. Properties in this district must be located on a major arterial, secondary arterial, or collector roadways.

                  M.  Open space not to be encroached upon: No open space may be encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity with the yard, setback, off-street parking spaces, and other such required development standards contained in the ordinance. Shrubbery, driveways, retaining walls, fences, curbs, and buffers (see definition in article 2) are not considered to be encroachments of yards. Open space areas as required by this ordinance must be permanently maintained as open space in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  N.  Reduction of yards or lot area: Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, a lot existing at the time of passage of this ordinance may not be reduced, divided, or changed so as to produce a tract of land which does not comply with the minimum dimension or area requirements of this ordinance for the district in which it is located unless that reduction or division is necessary to provide land which is needed and accepted for public use. 
                  O.  Lots with multiple frontage: In the case of a corner lot or double frontage lot, front yard setback requirements apply to all lot lines abutting a street. 
                  P.  Landlocked lots: In the case of a landlocked lot (lot without direct access to a public street or road) lawfully existing as of the effective date of this ordinance, the property owner is entitled to one building permit, as long as all of the following requirements are met: 
                  1.  No other principal building exists or is being constructed on the property. 
                  2.  No other valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance and is currently valid. 
                  3.  The property was and continues to be under single ownership since the effective date of this ordinance. 
                  4.  The property owner has acquired a 30-foot easement to a city-, county-, or state-maintained street or road, and the easement has been duly recorded and made a part of the property deed. 
                  5.  In the event the property is divided, no additional permits will be issued. 
                  Q.  Street frontage: No principal building may be erected on any lot which has less than 30 feet of immediate frontage on at least one public street. 
                  R.  Yards and other spaces: No part of a yard, other open space, off-street parking, or loading space required for another building may be included as a part of the yard, off-street parking, or loading space required for another building, except as specifically provided for in this ordinance. 
                  S.  Substandard lots: Any lot existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance, which has an area or a width which is less than required by this ordinance, is subject to the following exceptions and modifications: 
                  1.  Adjoining lots in same ownership: When two or more adjoining and vacant lots within a nonapproved development with continuous frontage are in a single ownership at the time of application and such lots have a frontage or lot area less than is required by the district in which they are located, such lots must be replatted or reparceled so as to create one or more lots which conform to the minimum frontage and area requirements of the district; 
                  2.  Single lot: When a lot has an area or frontage which does not conform with the requirements of the district in which it is located, but was a lot at the effective date of this ordinance, such a lot may be used for any use allowed in the zoning district in which it is located as long as all other requirements of this ordinance are met. 
                  T.  Encroachment on public rights-of-way: No building, structure, service area, required off-street parking, or loading/unloading facility is permitted to encroach on public rights-of-way. 
                  U.  Physical design standards: Minimum design standards for driveways, loading areas, and other such physical site improvements are contained in applicable development regulations of Screven County. Consult the zoning administrator for specific, requirements. 
                  V.  Off-street parking and service requirements: Minimum standards for off-street parking and service requirements are contained in the Screven County Standard for Off-street Parking and Service Facilities (appendix B [to this appendix]). 
                  W.  Other applicable development regulations: Information concerning any other applicable development regulations may be obtained from the zoning administrator. 
                  X.  Signs: Minimum design and location standards for signs are contained in the Screven County Sign Ordinance. Consult article 18 of this appendix for specific requirements.

                  b.  Employs no more than five persons. (The intent here is to ensure that activities which are primarily manufacturing in nature are directed away from commercial zoning districts and into manufacturing zoning districts. Establishments with five or fewer manufacturing employees in connection with a commercial activity are considered to be primarily commercial and compatible with a commercial district. Manufacturing activities with more than five employees would be considered large enough to belong in a manufacturing district with other such uses rather than in a commercial district.) 
                  D.  The following accessory uses are permitted as conditional uses in GC districts: 
                  1.  None.

                  G.  Maximum building height: Maximum building height shall not exceed 45 feet. This height limit does not apply to projections not intended for human habitation. For buildings and structures with such projections, the minimum required yards must be increased one foot for every two feet (or part of two feet) of height greater than 45 feet. 
                  H.  (Reserved). 
                  I.  Sight distance: Within 30 feet of an intersection's pavement edge, plants cannot be of a type which will obstruct the view of vehicular traffic.

Almost any type of planted vegetation is permissible. 
                  J.  Applicability to land and buildings: No building, structure or land may be used or occupied—and no building or structure or part of a building or structure may be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered—unless in conformity with all of the regulations specified for the district in which it is located. 
                  K.  Every use must be on a lot: No building or structure may be erected or use established unless upon a lot as defined by this ordinance. 
                  L.  Multiple principal buildings on commercial lots: More than one principal building and its accessory buildings may be erected on a lot in a GC zoning district, except for single-family dwellings. 
                  M.  Open space not to be encroached upon: No open space may be encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity with the yard, setback, off-street parking spaces, and other such required development standards contained in the ordinance. Shrubbery, driveways, retaining walls, fences, curbs, and buffers (see definition in article 2) are not considered to be encroachments of yards. Open space areas as required by this ordinance must be permanently maintained as open space in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  N.  Reduction of yards or lot area: Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, a lot existing at the time of passage of this ordinance may not be reduced, divided, or changed so as to produce a tract of land which does not comply with the minimum dimension or area requirements of this ordinance for the district in which it is located unless that reduction or division is necessary to provide land which is needed and accepted for public use. 
                  O.  Lots with multiple frontage: In the case of a corner lot or double frontage lot, front yard setback requirements apply to all lot lines abutting a street.

                  1.  No other principal building exists or is being constructed on the property. 
                  2.  No other valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance and is currently valid. 
                  3.  The property was and continues to be under single ownership since the effective date of this ordinance. 
                  4.  The property owner has acquired a 30-foot easement to a city-, county-, or state-maintained street or road, and the easement has been duly recorded and made a part of the property deed. 
                  5.  In the event the property is divided, no additional permits will be issued. 
                  Q.  Street frontage: No principal building may be erected on any lot which has less than 30 feet of immediate frontage on at least one public street. 
                  R.  Yards and other spaces: No part of a yard, other open space, off-street parking, or loading space required for another building may be included as a part of the yard, off-street parking, or loading space required for another building, except as specifically provided for in this ordinance. 
                  S.  Substandard lots: Any lot existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance, which has an area or a width which is less than required by this ordinance, is subject to the following exceptions and modifications: 
                  1.  Adjoining lots in same ownership: When two or more adjoining and vacant lots within a nonapproved development with continuous frontage are in a single ownership at the time of application and such lots have a frontage or lot area less than is required by the district in which they are located, such lots must be replatted or reparceled so as to create one or more lots which conform to the minimum frontage and area requirements of the district; 
                  2.  Single lot: When a lot has an area or frontage which does not conform with the requirements of the district in which it is located, but was a lot at the effective date of this ordinance, such a lot may be used for any use allowed in the zoning district in which it is located as long as all other requirements of this ordinance are met. 
                  T.  Encroachment on public rights-of-way: No building, structure, service area, required off-street parking, or loading/unloading facility is permitted to encroach on public rights-of-way. 
                  U.  Physical design standards: Minimum design standards for driveways, loading areas, and other such physical site improvements are contained in applicable development regulations of Screven County. Consult the zoning administrator for specific requirements. 
                  V.  Off-street parking and service requirements: Minimum standards for off-street parking and service requirements are contained in the Screven County Standard for Off-street Parking and Service Facilities (appendix B [to this appendix]). 
                  W.  Other applicable development regulations: Information concerning any other applicable development regulations may be obtained from the zoning administrator. 
                  X.  Signs: Minimum design and location standards for signs are contained in the Screven County Sign Ordinance. Consult that document [article 18 of this appendix] for specific requirements.

                  NC zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve small business areas of a limited nature that serve primarily the residential neighborhood in which they are located. Development standards for NC districts are designed to promote compatibility with the surrounding residential neighborhood. In order to promote such business development so far as is possible and appropriate in each area, uses are prohibited which would create hazards, offensive or loud noises, vibrations, smoke, glare, heavy truck traffic, or late hours of operation. The intent of this district is also to encourage the concentration of local business areas in locations proposed in the comprehensive plan to the mutual advantage of both consumers and merchants and thereby promote the best use of land at certain strategic locations.

                  Sec. 1401. - Purpose. 
                  LI zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve physically and aesthetically desirable areas in which clean, low- intensity manufacturing activities may locate and be protected from the intrusion of incompatible land uses. By having such areas available, both new and existing industries may operate and undertake expansion of facilities with the least possible adverse effect on other types of activities which might be incompatible with manufacturing. The elimination of nonmanufacturing activities from LI districts benefits manufacturing activities by removing some possible obstacles to their smooth operation and expansion. 
                  This district is intended for firms that assemble or fabricate manufactured products that are ready for retail sale. Processing of certain types of agricultural products is allowed in this district. Firms that utilize substantial quantities of water in manufacturing are not permitted in this district. All establishments in this district are subject to review to determine development of regional impact (DRI) status. 
                  Sec. 1402. - Permitted uses.

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (8) --- 
                  Editor's note— An Ord. of Nov. 9, 2004 repealed former article 16, §§ 1601, 1602, in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former art. 16 pertained to the CP - conservation preservation district and derived from zoning ordinance of Oct. 27, 1998. 

                  Sec. 1601. - Purpose. 
                  The special preservation district is established to provide for the proper placement of private, semiprivate and public uses, which require special consideration because of their character, physical setting, size and/or relation to surrounding land uses. This district consist of lands that are located along major rivers, creeks and streams or other areas as determined by the planning commission and involve environmental sensitive areas that are best served by requiring minimum development standards to help protect the natural environment, reduce flood damage, improve water runoff quality and minimize increased flood velocity. It is the intent of this district to provide standards that allow desirable land uses while protecting our natural resources that are not served by the county road system. 
                  The provisions of this district shall take precedence over any conflicts or requirements of other ordinances relating to subdivisions as adopted by the county. 
                  This district is designed for low-density development with low traffic volumes. It is not the intent or desire of the county to own, develop, or accept roads that are in a floodplain or environmental sensitive areas associated with this special district. Therefore, the county will require that all roads providing ingress and egress to be privately owned and maintained in these sensitive and floodprone areas.

Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this article shall not be required to meet the provisions of this article, other than sections 1704.K, 1704.L, 1704.M and section 1708; and the requirements of sections 1704.E (except subsection 1704.E.5), 1704.G and 1704.H within six months from the date of adoption of this article. Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to in this article as "preexisting towers" or "preexisting antennas"; provided, however, that the placement of antennas on any nonconforming structure shall not create a vested right for the continued use of the structures should the nonconforming use cease. If an additional antenna is collocated upon a preexisting tower after adoption of this article, then the requirements of sections 1704.E (except subsection 1704.E.5), 1704.G and 1704.H shall be met as part of the permitting process. 
                  E.  Agricultural GPS towers. Except as other provided herein, GPS Redistribution towers shall conform to all requirement of this Article with the exception of the following: Subsections 1704B, 1704C, 1704D, 1704G, and 1704H. 
                  (Ord. of 9-8-2009, § 3) 
                  Sec. 1704. - General provisions. 
                  A.  Principal or accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structures. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements including, but not limited to, setback, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use of structure. 
                  B.  Five-year plan and inventory of existing sites. To facilitate the collocation of antennas and future land use planning, each applicant seeking to locate a new tower, alternative tower structure or antenna, or modify any such existing structure, shall provide to the department an inventory of its existing towers or alternative tower structures, existing towers or alternative structures to be upgraded or replaced, and proposed towers or alternative structures. Applicants seeking to erect an amateur radio or antenna shall be exempt from this provision. 
                  1.  The inventory shall include all such structures that are within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; within a municipality located, in whole or in part, within Screven County; or within a neighboring county which currently is capable of providing coverage or capacity within Screven County, and shall include specific information about the location (latitude and longitude coordinates), height, design tower type and general suitability for antenna collocation of each tower or alternative structure, and other pertinent information as may be required by the department. 
                  2.  If the applicant does not know specific future tower and antenna site locations but does know of areas where telecommunications facilities will be needed within the next five years to provide service, the applicant shall list the assessor's blocks contained within the geographic service area and identify each geographic service area with number that will correspond to the future telecommunication facility site. 
                  3.  The department may share the location of existing telecommunication facility sites with other applicants seeking to locate towers or antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that the department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. The location of any proposed telecommunication facility sites will be protected as privileged information if the applicant so requests and it is considered as such under the applicable laws and legal authority. 
                  C.  Collocation: design requirements. In addition to all applicable building and safety codes, all towers, except amateur radio towers, shall be designed to accommodate the collocation of cellular telecommunication antennas according to the following: 
                  1.  For towers up to 150 feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least three providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology whichever is greater; 
                  2.  For towers greater than 150 feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least four providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology whichever is greater. 
                  D.  Collocation; availability of suitable existing structures. No new tower except amateur radio towers, shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department and governing authority that no existing tower or existing alternative tower structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of one or more of the following: 
                  1.  That no existing towers or suitable alternative tower structure are located within the geographic antenna placement area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  2.  That existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  3.  That existing towers or structures do have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's antenna and related equipment; 
                  4.  That the applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna; 
                  5.  That the cost or contractual provisions required by the tower owner to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing exceed the cost of new tower development; 
                  6.  That the applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable, other than economic reason. 
                  E.  Aesthetics. The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the design and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article and shall be approved by the administrator. 
                  1.  Towers and/or antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  2.  All tower sites, the design of all buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment. Any equipment or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view and made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
                  3.  For antennas installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical ground equipment shall be of a neutral color so as to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive. 
                  4.  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, it shall not exceed the minimum required by the applicable authority. 
                  5.  No signage or other identifying markings of a commercial nature shall be permitted upon any tower or alternative tower structure with Screven County. 
                  6.  To the extent practical, telecommunication facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  7.  Access to the tower site shall be restricted so as to minimize visibility of the access. Where possible, existing roads shall be used. Where no road exist, access shall follow the existing contours of the land. 
                  8.  Such other additional requirements as the administrator shall reasonably require to minimize the visual impact of the site of the surrounding area. 
                  F.  Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers: 
                  1.  Tower shall be setback a distance of 200 feet or 1.5 times the height of the tower from its base, whichever is greater, to any public right-of-way, occupied structure, or property line of the lot or parcel containing the tower. 
                  2.  Guy wires and accessory buildings and facilities shall meet the minimum accessory use location and setback requirements. 
                  G.  Security fencing; anticlimbing devices. All towers and supporting equipment shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than eight feet in height and shall also be equipped with appropriate anticlimbing devices. Fencing shall be of chainlink or other approved alternative and shall be secured with an industrial grade keyed padlock with a duplicate key being provided to the governing authority through its county administrator. 
                  H.  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern landscaping surrounding all towers: 
                  1.  Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. 
                  2.  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  3.  Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the administrator to ensure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this article. 
                  Amateur radio towers and antennas, or receive-only antennas shall not be subject to the provision of this section unless required by the governing authority through the conditional use permit process. 
                  I.  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street, utilizing existing access to the property on which such facility is to be located, where possible. 
                  J.  Review of tower and antenna erection by the airport authority. If upon receipt of an application for the erection of any tower or alternative tower structure governed by this article, the department deems that the proposed structure may interfere with or affect the use of the airways of the county by the public or interfere with or affect the operation of existing or proposed airport facilities, a copy of the application shall be submitted by the Department of Screven County Airport Authority for review and recommendation. 
                  K.  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the permittee or the lessee of the tower and antenna governed by this article shall bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall be deemed to be a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's, permittee's, or lessee's expense. 
                  L.  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner, permittee, or subsequent lessee of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the department concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee, or lessee of the tower, said party shall have 15 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within 15 days shall be deemed a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for removal of the tower. Prior to the removal of any tower, the department may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above referenced compliance period. Agricultural GPS towers shall, however, be exempt from construction standards requiring a design that will withstand wind speeds in excess of 90 miles per hour. 
                  M.  Change of ownership notification. Upon the transfer of ownership of an interest in any tower, alternative tower structure, or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the department of the transaction in writing within 30 days.

                  Sec. 1706. - Administrative approvals. 
                  A.  General. 
                  1.  The department may administratively approve the uses set forth in section 1706.E of this article. All such uses shall comply with requirements set forth in this article and all other applicable codes and ordinances. 
                  2.  Except as provided in section 1706.D, the department shall respond to each application within 45 days of its receipt by either approving or denying the application. One 45-day extension of this review period may be exercised by the department if such additional time is deemed necessary to adequately assess the request. If the department fails to respond to the applicant within a maximum of 90 days, the application shall be deemed to be approved. 
                  3.  As part of any administrative approval, the department may administratively reduce setback requirements by up to ten percent to compensate for irregularly shaped lots or parcels; provided, however, that setback requirements shall not be reduced in conflict with engineering requirements for safety or structural failure containment [see section 1705.A.5.(e)]. 
                  4.  Any decision by the department that results in the denial of a request to place, construct, or modify wireless telecommunications facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence. In addition to the requirements set forth in section 1706.E for uses allowed by administrative approval, the department shall consider the applicable factors set forth in section 1707.F in acting upon an application for administrative approval. 
                  B.  Application contents fee. All applications for administrative approval of a permit shall be submitted to the Screven County zoning administrator. Each application shall contain as a part thereof detailed plans and specifications as set forth in section 1705. An application for administrative approval for [a] permit shall not be accepted for processing without the information required in section 1705 of this article. An application fee shall be charged by the department in an amount stated in section 1709 of this article. 
                  C.  Collocation of antennas required. Applicants for the erection of a tower of placement of an antenna shall be required to collocate upon an existing tower or alternative tower structure. An exception to collocation shall only be made if the applicant adequately demonstrates that an existing tower suitable for collocation does not exist in the geographic antenna placement area, and that no suitable alternative tower structure is available as set forth in section 1704.D. 
                  D.  Independent expert review. If, in the opinion of the office, an independent expert review of an application is warranted, the office may engage a licensed professional engineer or other appropriate professional, as an independent expert to review any of the materials submitted by an applicant and render an opinion on any issue relevant to the application, the adequacy of the supporting data, structural integrity and the feasibility of alternative sites or collocation. Upon the review by an independent expert, the department shall convey its concerns to the applicant in writing and shall allow the applicant a reasonable opportunity to address those concerns. If the applicant is unable to satisfactorily address those concerns, the applicant shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days, in which to modify the application to alleviate the department's concerns or withdraw the application altogether. The expert's opinion shall be considered determinative, unless the applicant agrees to pay the expenses of submitting both opinions for a peer review, which review shall then be considered final. If the independent third party expert supports the applicant's expert, then the department shall pay the expenses of said third-party expert. If the independent third-party expert supports the position of the department, then the applicant shall respond within 30 days following the final review as herein provided. No permit shall be issued until the applicant has paid all expenses incurred under this section. 
                  E.  Uses allowed by administrative approval. The following uses may be approved by the department after conducting an administrative review: 
                  1.  If it is adequately demonstrated that antenna collocation, as required by section 1706.C above, is not possible for a given geographic antenna placement area, construction of a new tower up to a height of 150 feet, including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or antenna, may be permitted in the following zoning districts: 
                  a.  General commercial (GC).

                  ARTICLE 18. - SIGN REGULATIONS[9] 

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (9) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3, adopted April 27, 2004, amended article 18 in its entirety to read as herein set out. The provisions of Ord. of 4-27-2004(2) were specifically delineated as §§ 3-7-1—3-7-19; hence, the inclusion of these provisions, as specified on the ordinance, was at the discretion of the editor. For stylistic purposes, capitalization has been changed to conform to the Code of Ordinances; however, internal references remain unchanged from the original ordinance. Former article 18, §§ 1801—1813, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from the county's zoning ordinance, as adopted by the board of commissioners on October 27, 1998. 

                  Sec. 3-7-1. - Title. 
                  This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Screven County Sign Ordinance". (Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3) 
                  Sec. 3-7-2. - Purpose. 
                  Sign regulations achieve public safety rationales not achieved by standard building code provisions. Without a sign ordinance, signs can pose a clear danger to public safety. It has long been recognized that sign controls are needed to promote traffic safety and avoid traffic accidents. Signs can distract motorists by impairing visibility. Traffic safety is improved by restricting the size, height, and location of signs. Signs, if unregulated, can confuse motorists by mimicking traffic safety signals and signs. 
                  Unregulated signs may negatively affect the character of communities and the value of buildings. For example, blighted signs and antiquated signs and sign structures (i.e., the pole with a blank structure for a sign face) can contribute to an overall image of blight and a reduction of property values in declining areas if not addressed and removed via sign controls. Unregulated signs can reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public because they compete with public purpose signs and reduce their visibility and effectiveness. Unregulated signage in special character areas, such as the downtown, would almost assuredly neutralize any public plans and investments to improve streetscapes. 
                  Sign regulation serves the interests of the business community. Unregulated competition among businesses where individual business signs are not adequately visible results in too many signs and a point of diminishing returns. Sign regulations help to maintain the scenic heritage and unique character of the community. Signs substantially influence the appearance of the community, and sign regulation is essential to the community's long-term economic viability. Sign controls improve visual character. 
                  This ordinance is adopted to serve substantial governmental interests by correcting and avoiding multiple problems that would occur without the regulation of signs and advertising devices. The regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in this statement of purposes. 
                  (Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3) 
                  Sec. 3-7-3. - Intent. 
                  It is not the intent of this ordinance to apply regulation to signs because of a disagreement with the message that they convey, to foreclose important and distinct mediums of expression for political, religious, or personal messages, or to suggest the county regulate the message content of signs in any manner. It is, however, the intent of this ordinance to regulate the time, place, and manner of signs in a minimal manner sufficient to meet the public purposes articulated in the purpose section of this ordinance. 
                  (Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3) 
                  Sec. 3-7-4. - Applicability. 
                  A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained within the planning jurisdiction of the county only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this ordinance. 
                  The effect of this ordinance as more specifically set forth herein shall: 
                  (a)  Establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial, residential and industrial areas that are subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this ordinance. 
                  (b)  Allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive, and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this ordinance, but without a requirement for permits. 
                  (c)  Provide for temporary signs without commercial messages in limited circumstances in the public right-of-way. 
                  (d)  Prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this ordinance. 
                  (e)  Provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance.

                  3-7-7.3. Permits to construct or modify signs. It shall be unlawful for any person to post, display, substantially change, or erect a sign in the county without first having obtained a building permit, if required by the standard building code as adopted by the county, for said sign. The applicant for a building permit shall submit application materials as specified by the building inspector, including a sketch or print drawn to scale showing pertinent information, such as wind pressure requirements and display materials, in accordance with the standard building code. Such permits shall be issued only in accordance with the following requirements and procedures. 
                  3-7-7.3.1. Permit for new sign or for sign modification. An application for construction, creation, or installation of a new sign or for modification of an existing sign shall be accompanied by detailed drawings to show the dimension, design, structure, and location of each particular sign, to the extent that such details are not contained on a master signage plan or common signage plan then in effect for the lot. One application and permit may include multiple signs on the same lot. 
                  3-7-7.3.2. Inspection. The county shall inspect each lot for which a permit for a new sign or for modification of an existing sign is issued on or before six months from the date of issuance of such permit.

                  The maximum height of any ground sign regulated by this ordinance shall be 30 feet. No attached wall sign, except those exempted by this ordinance, shall exceed the height of the tallest building on the lot. 
                  (Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3) 
                  Sec. 3-7-11. - Minimum setback from right-of-way. 
                  No sign regulated by this ordinance shall be placed or erected closer than two feet of a city, county, state, or federal road right-of-way. 
                  (Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3) 
                  Sec. 3-7-12. - Free standing signs. 
                  The provisions of this section shall govern the number, location, and spacing of freestanding signs. 
                  3-7-12.1. Residential and office subdivision. Signs located in residential district and office subdivisions shall be located at the primary entrance(s) to the development/subdivision or at the beginning of the street upon which the development/subdivision connects directly to an arterial or collector street as shown on the major thoroughfare plan. 
                  3-7-12.2. Other freestanding signs.

                  Sec. 3-7-13. - Computations. 
                  The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height. 
                  3-7-13.1. Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall. 
                  3-7-13.2. Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. 
                  3-7-13.3. Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest point of the sign face. Normal grade shall be construed to be the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade of the sign is lower than the grade of the adjacent public street, normal grade shall be construed to be the grade of the adjacent public street. "Adjacent public street" shall mean the street providing approved vehicle access to the property and which does or would bear the street address for the property. 
                  3-7-13.4. Computation of maximum total permitted sign area. Lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street. 
                  (Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3) 
                  Sec. 3-7-14. - Design, construction, and maintenance. 
                  All signs shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following standards. 
                  (a)  Except for banners, flags, and temporary signs conforming in all respects with the requirements of this ordinance, all signs shall be constructed of permanent materials and shall be permanently attached to the ground, a building, or other structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall, frame, or structure. 
                  (b)  Every sign, including, but not limited to those signs for which permits are required, shall be maintained in a safe, presentable, and sound structural condition. 
                  (1)  To prevent rust, peeling, flaking, fading or rotting, all signs and supports shall be painted, unless anodized or similarly treated. 
                  (2)  Broken panels, missing letters, defective illumination, torn fabric, flaking or peeling paint and other damage to a sign, shall be replaced or repaired. 
                  (c)  If a determination is made by the county that any sign is unsafe, not secure, in violation of this section, or is in violation of any applicable law or a public danger, notice of such violation shall be given to the property owner and/or occupant where such sign is located. The property owner and/or occupant shall have 30 days from the date of said notice to remove, repair, or remedy said violation.

                  Sec. 3-7-15. - Signs in the public right-of-way. 
                  No signs shall be allowed in the public right-of-way except the following. 3-7-15.1. Permanent Signs. 
                  (a)  Public signs erected by or on behalf of a governmental body to post legal notices, identify public property, convey public information, and direct or regulate pedestrian or vehicular traffic. 
                  (b)  Bus stop signs erected by a public transit company.

                  (d)  Inflatable signs and tethered balloons not in accordance with subsection 5.5. 
                  (e)  Signs painted on or attached to trees, fence posts, rocks or other natural features, telephone or utility poles, or painted on the roofs of building visible from any public thoroughfare. 
                  (f)  Signs using the words "stop", "danger", or any other word, phrase, symbol or character in a manner that misleads, confuses or distracts a vehicle driver. 
                  (g)  Trailer signs. 
                  (h)  Roof signs. 
                  (i)  Any sign or sign structure other than freestanding and vertical wall extension, any portion of which extends above the parapet, building roof line or canopy against which the sign is located.

                  Sec. 3-7-17. - Nonconforming signs and signs without permits. 
                  3-7-17.1. Signs existing on effective date. O.C.G.A. 32-6-83 states, "Any municipal corporation or county is authorized to acquire by purchase, gift, or condemnation and to pay just compensation for any property rights in outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices which were lawfully erected but which do not conform with the provisions of any lawful ordinance, regulation, or which at a later date fail to comply with the provisions of any lawful ordinance, regulation, or due to changed conditions beyond the control of the sign owner. No municipal corporation or county shall remove or cause to be removed any such nonconforming outdoor advertising sign, display, or device without paying just compensation." In accordance, signs existing in the planning jurisdiction which were made nonconforming by the adoption of this ordinance shall be permitted to remain in place and be maintained, provided that no action is taken which increases the degree or extent of the nonconformity.

                  Sec. 3-7-18. - Criteria for approval of sign variances. 
                  A variance may be granted upon application if an individual case of unusual hardship is placed upon the applicant. The request for a variance must meet the following conditions. 
                  (a)  There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area. 
                  (b)  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar properties. 
                  (c)  Granting the variance requested would not confer upon the property of the applicant any significant privileges that are denied to other similar properties. 
                  (d)  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare. 
                  (e)  The special circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant. 
                  (f)  The variance is not a request to permit a type of sign which otherwise is prohibited by this ordinance. 
                  (g)  The mere existence of a nonconforming sign or advertising device shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance.

For example, if the sign is set back seven feet from such a lot, it may be no more than seven feet high. 
                  (c)  In addition to the setback requirements on this table, signs shall be located such that there is at every street intersection a clear view between heights of three feet and ten feet in a triangle formed by the corner and points on the curb 30 feet from the intersection or entrance way. 
                  (d)  The percentage figure here shall mean the percentage of the area of the wall of which such sign is a part or to which each such sign is most nearly parallel.

                  C.  Ingress and egress. Ingress and egress to off-street loading spaces must conform to curb cut requirements specified in this standard. 
                  Sec. 105. - Curb cut requirements. 
                  In any case in which provision for ingress and egress involves the lowering or cutting away of curbs, such a curb cut is subject to the following provisions: 
                  A.  Only one combined entrance and exit is allowed for any parcel of property with a frontage on any one street of less than 50 feet. No more than two combined entrances and exits are allowed for any parcel of property with a frontage on any one street of between 50 feet and 200 feet. For parcels of property having frontage on any one street of more than 200 feet, additional entrances or exits are permitted only after the developer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the planning commission that more curb cuts are needed for safety reasons, and such additional curb cuts are approved by the planning commission. 
                  B.  At street intersections, curb cuts must be located at least 25 feet from the intersections of the two curblines (or such lines extended) or at least 15 feet from the intersection of the two intersecting property lines (or such lines extended), whichever is less. 
                  C.  The distance between any two curb cuts on the same side of the street and located on one property must be at least ten feet. That distance is measured between the points at which the two curb cuts begin to deviate from the established curbline of the abutting street (in other words, between the intersections of the curb return radii and the established curbline of the abutting street). 
                  D.  The minimum setback from all property lines for any driveway is two feet. 
                  E.  The maximum permitted width of any driveway at the right-of-way line of the abutting street is 35 feet. 
                  F.  The maximum permitted width of any curb cut, including the points at which the curb cut begins to deviate from the established curbline of the abutting street at either end of the curb cut (in other words, including the curb returns) is 50 feet. However, the zoning administrator may approve a specified larger width for a truckstop, if he determines that a larger curb cut is needed for safety reasons. The sum of the two curb return radii for any one curb cut must not exceed 15 feet.
