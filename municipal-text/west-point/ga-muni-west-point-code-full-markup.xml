PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of West Point, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1967 Code, as supplemented through April 11, 1988, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1967 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Indices 
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Ronald McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Joel T. Wood, City Administrator, and Charles A. Nix, former City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. 

 
ADOPTING ORDINANCE 
ORDINANCE OF DECEMBER 9, 1991 
An Ordinance Adopting and Enacting a New Code for the City of West Point, Georgia; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances not Included Therein; Providing a Penalty for the Violation Thereof; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; and Providing when Such Code and this Ordinance Shall Become Effective. 
Be it Ordained by the City Council of the City of West Point, Georgia: 
Section 1. The Code entitled "Code of Ordinances, City of West Point, Georgia" published by Municipal Code Corporation consisting of Chapters 1 through 22, each inclusive, is adopted. 
Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before October 9, 1989, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed; provided, however, that article 3, chapter 16 of the 1967 Code entitled "Noises" is not repealed and shall continue in full force and effect pending the adoption of a new ordinance on the subject. 
Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment in the city jail for not more than six (6) months or by both fine and imprisonment as aforesaid. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided shall apply to the amendment of any Code section whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief, and revocation of licenses or permits. 
Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the city to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
Section 6. Ordinances adopted after October 9, 1989 that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
Section 7. This ordinance shall become effective January 1, 1992. 
Passed and adopted by the Mayor and Aldermen this 9th day of December, 1991. 

Certificate of Adoption 
I hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of the ordinance at the regular meeting of the Mayor and Aldermen of the City of West Point held on the 9th day of December, 1991. 


SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Codified." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Not codified." 
In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the code's historical evolution.

                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use and connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."

                  (e)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees and administrative costs incurred by the municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.

The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  (2)  Upon final determination of costs, fees and expenses incurred in accordance with this chapter, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this chapter shall transmit to the appropriate municipal tax collector or city revenue officer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within ninety (90) days of completion of the repairs, demolition or closure. It shall be the duty of the appropriate municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Tit. 48, Ch. 4 provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The municipal tax collection or city revenue officer shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city. 
                  (3)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following receipt by the municipal tax collector or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this article. 
                  (4)  The redemption amount of any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this section shall be the full amount of costs as finally determined in accordance with this section together with interest, penalties and costs incurred by the governing authority, municipal tax collector or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (f)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  ARTICLE XIV. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS 

                  Sec. 6-351. - Rationale and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. It is neither the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
                  Note: The United States Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment protects non-obscene, sexually explicit materials and entertainment. Notwithstanding, the Court has stated that government may regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to eliminate or control the adverse secondary effects caused by these businesses. These adverse secondary effects include, but are not limited to, crime, sexually transmitted diseases, urban blight, declining property values, and lower quality of life. Enactment of legislation regulating sexually oriented businesses must be supported by factual findings of adverse secondary effects made by the enacting body. 
                  Case law annotations: Courts normally review content-based restrictions on speech under "strict scrutiny" review, and require government to show a "compelling state interest" for the restriction. However, the Supreme Court has stated that, because restrictions on sexually explicit speech are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, the proper level of review is whether the regulation is narrowly tailored to a substantial government interest. See County of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, 475 U.S. 41,48(1986); United States v. O'brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968). Here, the substantial government interest is combating adverse secondary effects. If the ordinance targeted the speech itself, the test would be strict scrutiny, a burden almost impossible to meet. 
                  (b)  Findings and rationale. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the council, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions incorporated in the cases of City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D-4, L.L.C., 124 S. Ct. 2219 (June 7, 2004); City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002); Pap's A.M. v. City of Erie, 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of Renton v.

City of College Park, 265 Ga. 618 (1995); Airport Bookstore, Inc. v. Jackson, 242 Ga. 214 (1978); and based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas - 1986; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Houston, Texas - 1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979, 1995-98; Chattanooga, Tennessee - 1999-2003; Minneapolis, Minnesota - 1980; Los Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Spokane, Washington - 2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota - 1994; Littleton, Colorado - 2004; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma - 1986; Dallas, Texas - 1997; Greensboro, North Carolina - 2003; Amarillo, Texas - 1977; New York, New York Times Square - 1994; and the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), 
                  The Mayor and Council of the City of West Point, Georgia find that: 
                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
                  (2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from certain land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and the surrounding area, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one (1) area. 
                  (3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes harm that the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
                  (4)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
                  (5)  Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. See, e.g., Bames v. Glen Theatre 501 U.S. 560, 583 (1991). 
                  (6)  Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug-dealing and drug use. See, e.g., Key, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir. 1986). 
                  (7)  Alcohol consumption in adult establishments increases the likelihood of crime, illegal drug use, and illegal sexual activity, and encourages undesirable behavior that is not in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. See, e.g., Artistic Entertainment, Inc. v. County of Warner Robins, 223 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir. 2000); Sammy's Ltd. v. County of Mobile, 140 F.3d 993, 996 (11th Cir. 1998), cent. denied, 529 U.S. 1052, 146 L. Ed. 2d 459, 120 S. Ct. 1553 (2000). 
                  (8)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
                  (9)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
                  (10)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments. 
                  (11)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity. 
                  (12)  It is desirable, in the prevention of crime and the spread of communicable diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this article is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
                  (13)  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this article. 
                  (14)  The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of five (5) years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct, and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
                  (15)  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
                  (16)  The findings noted in subsections (b)(1)—(15) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns.

                  Buffer. A natural or enhanced vegetated area with no or limited minor land disturbances, such as trails and picnic areas, located adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed or river corridor. 
                  Corridor. All land within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed and within other setbacks located elsewhere in this chapter. 
                  DRASTIC. The standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. The DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility. 
                  Hazardous waste. Any solid waste, by reason of its toxic, caustic, corrosive, abrasive, or otherwise injurious properties, may be detrimental to the health of any person handling or otherwise coming into contact with such material or substance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has developed a list of hazardous wastes based upon corrosivity, reactivity and toxicity. 
                  Impervious surface. A manmade structure or surface preventing the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools or patios.

                  Perennial stream. A stream that flows throughout the whole year as indicated on United States Geological Survey (USGS) quadrangle map. 
                  Pollution susceptibility. The relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps. Maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources, using the DRASTIC methodology. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low ground water pollution potential.

                  Regulated activity. Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Reservoir boundary. The edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool level. 
                  River/stream bank. The rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  Significant recharge area. Those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1998 Edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type, thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. Significant recharge areas are as follows in the various geologic provinces of Georgia: 
                  In the Piedmont and in the Blue Ridge, rocks have little primary porosity, with most groundwater being stored in the overlying soils. The significant recharge [areas] are those with thicker soils. Field mapping indicates thick soils in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge are characterized by a density of two (2) or more geologic contacts per four (4) square miles (source: 1976 1:500,000 Geologic Map of Georgia) and slopes lower than eight (8) percent.

                  Sec. 7.5-25. - Findings of fact. 
                  Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-01) 
                  Sec. 7.5-26. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.

                  DIVISION 2. - WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED DISTRICT 

                  Sec. 7.5-40. - Findings of fact. 
                  In order to provide for the health, safety, welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated, expensive and rendering water resources unusable. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby drinking water supplies. 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-01) 
                  Sec. 7.5-41. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this division of the water resource district chapter is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply for the city which will minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, and maintain the yield of the water supply watersheds. This division shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the city.

                  Sec. 7.5-42. - District delineation. 
                  The water supply watershed districts are hereby designated, and shall comprise the land areas which drain to the city water supply intake. The boundaries of these districts are defined by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius seven (7) miles upstream of the respective water supply intake. These districts shall be further delineated and defined on the water resource district map of the city, which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this chapter by reference. 
                  The following water supply watershed district is hereby defined and boundaries shall be identified on the water resource district map: 
                  The West Point Water Supply Watershed is a large water supply watershed. An intake for the city is located on the Chattahoochee River. This water supply watershed does not contain a reservoir. 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-01) 
                  Sec. 7.5-43. - Permitted uses. 
                  The following regulations shall apply to the West Point Water Supply Watershed identified on the water resource districts map as a large water supply watershed without a reservoir. Uses which are lawful at the time of adoption of this chapter shall be allowed to continue as lawful land uses until such time as the use is abandoned. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts as established by this chapter are permitted in the water supply watershed district, subject to the following standards: 
                  New facilities which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and amounts of ten thousand (10,000) pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements of the Standard Fire Prevention Code.

                  DIVISION 3. - RIVER CORRIDOR PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 7.5-60. - Findings of fact. 
                  River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Georgia. These corridors are of vital importance to Georgia by helping to preserve the qualities which make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation and a source of clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation and help absorb floodwaters.

                  Sec. 7.5-61. - Purpose. 
                  The Chattahoochee River has been designated as a protected river by the state. The purpose of this division is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Chattahoochee River as defined herein. 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-01) 
                  Sec. 7.5-62. - Definitions. 
                  Hazardous waste. Any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal Act, which are in force and effective on February 1, 1998, codified as 40 C.F.R. section 261.3. (Note: this is the same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.) 
                  Land-disturbing activity. Any grading, scraping, excavating, filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding or alteration of a structure. Land-disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling and the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
                  Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area. A river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural flora for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "The Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species.

                  Sec. 9-1. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and council of the City of West Point, Georgia, does ordain as follows. 
                  (Ord. No. 2012-4, art. 1(A), 7-9-12) 
                  Sec. 9-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the City of West Point, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 2012-4, art. 1(B), 7-9-12) 
                  Sec. 9-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: Accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two (2) or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not however, include: (1) Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  ARTICLE V. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 9-56. - General standards. 
                  In ALL areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures that include ANY fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater: 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this ordinance, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 9-57. - Specific standards. 
                  In ALL areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements . Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one-foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 9-56(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one-foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in Al-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one-foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 9-43(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) Individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one-foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one-foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Reference: Subsection 9-56(6), above.) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections 9-57(3)a. and (3)c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 9-22, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  ONLY if subsection (4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article V.

                  Sec. 9-58. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-Zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 9-22, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 9-22, then the building inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of article V. ONLY if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (subsections (2) and (3)) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one-foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a Limited Detail Study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 9-56(4) "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The building inspector shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 9-22, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with section 9-57.

                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 9-22, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 9-56(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  The building inspector shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one (1) foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 9-42(1)c. and 9-42(2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  (a)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (b)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  (c)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and; 
                  (d)  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.

                  Sec. 9-81. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The board of adjustments as established by the City of West Point, Georgia shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustments may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Troup or Harris County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if ANY increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of adjustments shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued ONLY when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of adjustments may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  Sec. 10-12. - Arrest—Generally. 
                  The arresting officer, instead of summoning any person charged with violating any city ordinance, may, in his discretion, arrest the accused, releasing him upon his giving bond as provided in this chapter. The person arrested shall be notified of the charge against him and the time and place of his appearance and shall be entitled upon demand to a written statement of the charges against him and have compulsory process to obtain his witnesses. 
                  Sec. 10-13. - Same—Warrants. 
                  Except as otherwise provided by law, warrants for offenders against the ordinances of the city and the affidavits to obtain the same may be issued by the municipal court judge and shall be directed to the police of the city, or to the sheriff of the county or his deputies. The affidavit and warrant shall be substantially in the form of affidavits and warrants of offenders against the laws of the state, substituting for "Troup County" the words "City of West Point." The officer will execute the warrant placed in his hands, and the arresting officer shall exercise reasonable diligence in bringing the person arrested before the municipal court. 
                  Sec. 10-14. - Proceeding against corporation. 
                  Whenever complaint is made, under oath, that a corporation has violated any ordinance of this city, it shall be the duty of the officer to whom the complaint was made, having authority to issue warrants for violation of city ordinances, to issue a summons directed to the corporation, requiring it to appear by agent or attorney at the municipal court, at a time therein named, to answer the charge. Service in such cases may be made by delivering a copy of the affidavit of complaint and of the summons to any agent or employee of the defendant, at least three (3) days before the time set for the hearing. Any police officer being competent to make such service, the entry of the arresting officer of the city or affidavit of any other person shall be evidence of such service. The trial may proceed ex parte, if the defendant fails to appear. If judgment is against the defendant, it shall be for a fine and costs, the same to be collected by execution. 
                  Sec. 10-15. - Admitting to bail—Initially. 
                  Any person arrested by a city officer may give the arresting officer a bond with good security, resident of this city, approved by the chief of police or municipal court judge. 
                  Sec. 10-16. - Same—Rearrest. 
                  When from any cause the municipal court judge deems it necessary to take the defendant into custody in order to secure the attendance of a defendant out on bond at the trial, he shall issue his warrant for the rearrest of the defendant, except as otherwise provided by law, and shall commit the defendant to jail or require new bond, as the necessities of the case may demand. 
                  Sec. 10-17. - Appearance bond forfeiture. 
                  (a)  Generally. Upon failure of any party or witness or other person who is under bond to appear, such bond shall be forfeited, unless legal excuse is offered in his behalf. The duties in such case that would apply in the superior court to the district attorney, clerk and sheriff shall be performed by the city attorney, clerk of the municipal court and chief of police respectively. 
                  (b)  Special bail, rule to show cause. All bonds taken under this chapter and bonds given for appearance to abide the sentence of the court shall be special bail, and the power of the surety over the principal in any such bond shall be the same as in any special bail. Upon the failure to appear of any principal in any such bond or recognizance, the municipal court judge shall pass a rule requiring the principal and sureties on such bond to show cause on any day therein named, not to be less than ten (10) days from the passage of such rule, why they should not be required to pay the amount of such bond. This subsection does not apply to cash bonds. 
                  (c)  Service to rule. A copy of such rule shall be served upon the principal and surety, if to be found in the city, by any officer or member of the police force at least five (5) days before the time therein set for hearing. 
                  (d)  Judgment on failure to show cause. If no sufficient cause is shown, the municipal court judge shall proceed to enter judgment against such principal and surety for the amount of the bond. Execution shall be issued for the amount of such judgment and placed in the hands of the chief of police, who shall proceed to collect the same by levy and sale as in the case of tax executions; provided, however, judgment shall not be entered against either principal or surety until service shall have been perfected on either the principal or the surety. 
                  (e)  Issuance and service of scire facias. The clerk of the municipal court shall issue a scire facias on all forfeited bonds and recognizances, whether the same were for appearance before the municipal court or the city council, returnable to regular session of the municipal court against the principal and his sureties, which shall be served by any police officer at least ten (10) days before the return date, or, if the party resides out of the city, scire facias may be served by the publication of the same one (1) time in a public newspaper in the city at least ten (10) days before the return date. The official return of the police officer as to the service of the scire facias shall be sufficient evidence of such service. 
                  (f)  Entry of judgment. If at the regular session of the municipal court to which the scire facias is returnable no sufficient cause is shown to the contrary, judgment on motion shall be entered against such principal and sureties or such of them as have been served. 
                  (g)  Collection of judgment. Such judgments so rendered shall be a lien on the property of the defendant from the date of rendition and shall be enforced by execution to be issued by the city clerk, which may be levied and sales made thereunder as other executions. 
                  (h)  Surrender of principal. The bondsmen may surrender their principal at any time prior to the rendition of judgment on the scire facias issued by the clerk. Such surrender shall release the bondsmen except as to the cost accruing up to the time of such surrender. 
                  (i)  Not to abate proceedings. Forfeiture of bond shall not abate the proceedings against the defendant, and he may be rearrested and proceeded against for the offense committed. 
                  Sec. 10-18. - Costs. 
                  The costs taxed against the defendant and his sureties shall be in the same sums as the costs allowed officers of the magistrate court in criminal cases, which shall be paid into the city treasury. 
                  Sec. 10-19. - Nonpayment of fines and costs—Confinement. 
                  The officer in attendance on the municipal court shall take all persons who have been convicted by the court into his custody. In case such offender is financially able to do so and shall fail to pay the fine and costs immediately upon conviction, such officer shall confine such offender in the city jail until all fines and costs are paid, or shall execute the sentence of the court, whatever it may be. 
                  Sec. 10-20. - Same—Execution. 
                  (a)  On failure of any person on whom a fine is imposed to pay the same immediately, where he is financially able to do so, execution may issue to collect the same, although such person is imprisoned in default of paying such fine. 
                  (b)  The execution may issue instanter, to be levied upon the goods, chattels, lands and tenements of the person fined, which execution shall bear teste in the name of the mayor, be signed officially by the clerk and be directed to the chief of police. 
                  Sec. 10-21. - Prosecuting attorney. 
                  The city council may appoint a prosecuting attorney of the municipal court who shall have the duties and authorities as outlined in Georgia law to represent the city in municipal court. Such individual shall be a member in good standing of the State Bar of Georgia and admitted to practice before the appellate courts of this state. The prosecuting attorney shall serve on a part-time basis, and will be otherwise allowed to engage in the private practice of law. The part-time prosecuting attorney shall serve at the pleasure of the city council, and the city council shall also be authorized to appoint such substitute prosecuting attorneys as may be in the best interests of the city. Nothing herein shall prohibit the city attorney from prosecuting ordinance violations in municipal court or otherwise representing the interests of the city in municipal court or appeals therefrom.

Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 15-4(b) and (c) of this chapter. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 15-4(b) and (c) of this chapter shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms proper design and properly designed mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land-disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 15-4(c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 15-4(b)(2) of this chapter; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term ephemeral stream means a stream, that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 15-4(b) and (c) of this chapter. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-28, Exh. A, 10-12-09) 
                  Sec. 15-5. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of West Point without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 15-5(c) of this chapter. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 15-4(b) and (c) of this chapter will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three (3) copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 15-4(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 15-5(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this chapter section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 15-4(b) and (c) of this chapter, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by subsections 15-4(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 15-5(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this ordinance. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three (3) years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 15-6 - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The city will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 (a). The district or the Commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this chapter, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; and 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one (1) under the provisions of subsection 15-5(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)  Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this chapter, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this chapter under county ordinances approved under this chapter shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Section 8. - RPUD-1, residential planned unit development district. 
                  General purpose and description. 
                  To allow greater flexibility for development of certain tracts of land in the city, within a residential planned unit development district (RPUD-1) the developer may develop both single-family and multifamily residential uses under the regulations listed hereinafter: 
                  1.  Any use permitted in the R-2, multiple family district, with the following restrictions: 
                  (a)  Before an owner of property in the city applies for RPUD-1 designation for any property, a preliminary concept plan shall be submitted to the planning director along with a rezoning request. After preliminary review by the city staff, a public hearing shall be conducted by the municipal planning board on the rezoning request. A recommendation by the planning board on the rezoning request and concept plan shall be submitted to the mayor and council for approval at the next available meeting which shall be a public hearing. 
                  Upon of approval of the rezoning, a preliminary master plan shall be submitted to the planning board for review. Said preliminary master plan shall generally conform to the technical requirements of a preliminary plat as described in the subdivision regulations and shall designate the specific residential use of each area to be developed. Within thirty (30) days of the planning board review a report of its recommendation concerning the preliminary master plan shall be forwarded to the mayor and council for approval at the next available meeting. 
                  (b)  To be considered for designation as an RPUD-1 district, a development must be at least fifty (50) acres in overall size. 
                  (c)  Not less than ten (10) percent of the total area within the development shall be set aside as permanently open, undeveloped land. It is the intent of this ordinance that such open areas will be adequate to act as buffers between areas of differing use or density within a development in this district. 
                  (d)  Areas identified on the master plan for a residential planned unit development as "open," or "undeveloped" shall remain undeveloped in a natural state permanently, although nothing in this section shall prevent the owner from planting additional trees and shrubbery as needed to create an effective buffer or removing injurious growth to maintain the areas. Maintenance of "open" or "undeveloped" areas shall be solely the responsibility of the owner and not the city. 
                  (e)  All lots within the district shall have a required front yard not less than fifteen (15) feet, a rear yard not less than twenty (20) feet and a side yard not less than five (5) feet. 
                  (f)  No subdivision plat will be considered for approval in an RPUD-1 zone unless the preliminary master plan has been approved by the mayor and council for the entire property to be developed. For every area to be developed within a single residential planned unit development the owner shall submit a preliminary plat for consideration by the municipal planning board. These plats will be evaluated based on their conformity to the city's subdivision regulations, conformity to the preliminary master plan as submitted and approved, the need for such development in the city and the adequacy of utilities and improvements to be provided. Upon approval of a final plat for the last area to be developed, the preliminary master plan will become the final master plan for the residential planned unit development. 
                  (g)  Significant changes to the master plan must be approved by the mayor and council after a public hearing. Examples of significant changes are an increase in the total number of individual housing units to be developed, a decrease in the amount of land held as "open" areas, or changes in the locations of streets that will affect traffic flow through the development. 
                  2.  Area and dimensional regulations. Requirements will be based on the development scheme. All area and dimensional requirements shall be approved during the preliminary master plan review. 
                  3.  Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided in accordance with the requirements for specific uses set forth in section 18.

                  General purpose and description. 
                  The overall purpose of the MXD-1 is to allow and encourage flexibility and creativity in the design and development of comprehensively planned, mixed-use developments that would not be possible under conventional zoning districts. Residential, commercial, light industrial and other nonresidential uses shall be provided in such a manner to create an active street life, enhance the vitality of businesses and reduce vehicular traffic. 
                  The design of an MXD-1 is a creative exercise that allows the designer to select from an array of components to assemble the district based on individual development schemes. Unlike conventional mixed use developments which require a certain percentage of residential, commercial, and light industrial components, MXD-1 has no base zone requirements or percentages. This allows a property owner the flexibility to submit a preliminary master plan which meets their particular goals and objectives. A minimum of two (2) different use categories is required to obtain MXD-1 zoning. In no instance shall a MXD-1 preliminary plan be forwarded to council until the plan has been reviewed and approved by staff and also the municipal planning board.

                  The purpose of the Quality Development Corridor Overlay District (QDC) is to provide for a superior environment along transportation corridors through the application of an overlay district. The overlay zone regulations are intended to supplement the regulation of the underlying zoning districts and to provide for harmony and compatibility of non-residential development over the length of the corridor. This district is established to protect the public investment in major highways and arterial streets and ensure that these can continue to serve their primary functions of moving volumes of traffic safely. Provisions of the QDC are intended to expedite the free flow of traffic and reduce the hazard arising from unnecessary points of ingress and egress and cluttered roadside commercial development. The district is intended to enhance the value of adjacent lands by preserving and extending the useful life of the highway, avoiding land uses that conflict with the roadside and the surrounding area and reducing the risks of creating blighted areas. Insuring the attractiveness of roadside uses will contribute to and enhance trade, tourism, capital investment and general welfare.

A remote parking area may be established to satisfy the parking needs of a use permitted in the same district only if the space available on the principal lot does not meet the requirements of Table 18.02 or if a reasonable shared parking arrangement cannot be made.

                  (2)  Location requirements. Remote parking areas shall be located within reasonable walking distance of the principal lot. The parking area shall be located and its entrances and exits so arranged that vehicular and pedestrian traffic through surrounding residential areas will not be increased over that caused by existing on-street parking and through traffic.

                  (4)  Screening. A remote parking area shall be screened from adjacent residentially zoned and/or used property by a masonry wall or planted buffer strip not less than six (6) feet in height.

In addition, one (1) sign indicating restrictions on the use of the property shall be permitted at each entrance, but no such sign shall have an area of more than three (3) square feet. The above signs may be located adjacent to the public right-of-way but shall not be located within five (5) feet of any other property line.

                  10.  Provision for on-street parking. The provision of on-street parking in new development or redevelopment shall appropriate for the street type as well as the design of the development proposed.

                  b.  Layout configurations which require backing directly onto a street from a parking or loading space are strictly prohibited, except for single or two-family residential. 
                  (3)  Commercial vehicle parking in residential areas.

                  (c)  Minimize adverse visual impacts of towers through careful design, siting, and landscape screening; 
                  (d)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antenna failure through engineering and careful siting of towers and antennas; 
                  (e)  Maximize use of any new and existing towers through co-location so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the City of West Point, Georgia; 
                  (f)  Maximize and encourage use of alternate tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and

                  1.  General. The purpose of this article is to provide standards for the installation of trees and landscaping as part of the land development process in order to enhance the quality of life within the city. The reasons for requiring trees on a site and in parking lots are to provide shade, reduce temperatures, reduce stormwater runoff, and reduce air and water pollution. 
                  The following regulations seek to establish minimum standards for the provision, installation, and maintenance of landscape plantings in order to achieve a healthy, beautiful, and safe community and to enhance the city's environmental and visual character for its citizens' use and enjoyment by the following means: 
                  (1)  Improve environmental quality by recognizing the numerous beneficial effects of landscaping upon the environment such as improving air and water quality through such natural processes as photosynthesis and mineral uptake; reducing and reversing air, noise, heat and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacities of trees and other vegetation. 
                  (2)  Maintain and increase the value of land by requiring landscaping to be incorporated into development, thus becoming by itself a valuable capital asset. 
                  (3)  Provide direct and important physical and psychological benefits to human beings through the use of landscaping to reduce noise and glare, and to break up the monotony and soften the harsher aspects of urban development. 
                  (4)  Preserve existing natural vegetation where possible and incorporate native plants, plant communities, and ecosystems into landscape design. 
                  2.  Definitions.

                  1.  Annexation zoning process. Upon receipt of an application for annexation of property to the city, such application shall be placed on an agenda of city council meeting within sixty (60) days of the filing of such application. 
                  (1)  Procedure for annexation, specifically. Petitioners for annexation must present to the planning director the following: 
                  a.  A petition for annexation into the City of West Point, Georgia (which shall be in the form of a letter and include the petitioners name, mailing address, contact telephone number, and the address or tax map number of the property proposed for annexation). 
                  b.  A legal description of the property. 
                  c.  A survey by a licensed and registered land surveyor (which shall show, at a minimum, the extents of the property, size of acres, adjacent property owners, and the existing city limits line). Five (5) plats eighteen (18) inches by twenty-four (24) inches and one (1) eleven (11) inch by seventeen (17) inch plat shall be submitted with the application for annexation.

Upon review and favorable comment from DOJ, the annexation is officially in place. 
                  The procedure for rezoning of the property is identical to that of a conventional rezoning except that the hearing before the council shall be conducted simultaneously to the annexation of the subject property into the city. 
                  The zoning classification approved by the city following the hearing shall become effective on the later of: 
                  (1)  The date the zoning is approved by the council; and 
                  (2)  The date the annexation becomes effective pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 30-30-4. 
                  2.  House Bill 489. All annexation into the City of West Point shall meet all of the requirements for resolution of land use conflicts as required by State House Bill 489. The following procedure has been adopted as part of this legislation: 
                  1)  Definitions. The following definitions have been adopted specifically to carry out the procedures for this process. The implementation of any of the following definitions shall not have the effect of nullifying the implementation of any other definition. 
                  a.  Affected local government —"The Affected"—means the county or any municipality within one thousand (1,000) feet of the property to be annexed. 
                  b.  Bona fide land use classification objection —As it relates to this process, a bona fide land use classification objection is an objection to a proposed land use of an annexation petition which results in a substantial change in the intensity of the allowable use of the property or a change to a significantly different allowable use. Examples of bona fide land use classification impacts are: Negative effects on surrounding property, increase in traffic loads, environmental impacts, and/or additional public service needs. 
                  c.  Comprehensive plan —Means any plan by a county or municipality covering such county or municipality proposed or prepared pursuant to the minimum standards and procedures for preparation of comprehensive plans and for implementation of comprehensive plans established by the department of community affairs. 
                  d.  Future land use map —A required component of the comprehensive plan that shows graphically how a community wishes land uses to be designated and developed, usually over a twenty (20) year or long period. 
                  e.  Impact —Any negative effect on a piece of land brought about by a government through an annexation. 
                  f.  The initiator —Although not expressly defined in H.B. 489, means the county or municipality proposing annexation of property into proposing entity's jurisdictional limits. 
                  g.  Peculiar topography or site conditions —Means topography or other features that could cause unusually significant harm due to intense and incompatible adjacent development. 
                  h.  Significantly different allowable use —Means a use in a more intensive land use category such as: 
                  (1)  Office/Institutional versus Residential. 
                  (2)  Commercial versus Residential. 
                  (3)  Industrial versus Residential. 
                  (4)  Industrial versus Commercial. 
                  i.  Substantial change in intensity —Substantial change in the intensity of a proposed land use shall be defined as follows: 
                  (1)  If land use proposed is in a category of lesser impact— Not Substantial ; 
                  (2)  If land use proposed is in the same general category of impact and is an increase in density of less than or equal to twenty-five (25) percent of the adjoining land within the adjacent jurisdiction— Not Substantial ; 
                  (3)  If land use proposed is in the same general category of impact and is an increase in density of greater than twenty-five (25) percent of the adjoining land within the adjacent jurisdiction— Substantial ; or 
                  (4)  If the land use proposed is in the same general category of impact and results in a substantial change in intensity, verified by the affected party, which negatively affects surrounding property, increases traffic loads, presents environmental impacts and/or additional public service needs— Substantial . 
                  j.  Unique development —Means development of a one-of-a-kind nature such as a sports arena, stadium, race track, amusement park, university, or other similar developments. 
                  k.  Unusual development —Means development that is uncommon or rarely proposed for the region. 
                  2)  Amendment. This process shall be used when a local government receives an annexation request, or initiates an annexation. An amendment as this term is used in this agreement shall not include the annexation of any unincorporated island (as that term is defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-36-90) containing fifty (50) acres or less. 
                  3)  Notification. "The Initiator" shall notify other affected local governments of the proposed land use of an area to be annexed within five (5) business days of receipt of this request for annexation. This notification shall include all relevant data pertaining to the proposed land use of the area to be annexed. 
                  4)  Determination/intent to object. Within thirty (30) business days after notification, "the Affected" shall make a land use compatibility determination of whether the proposed use of the area to be annexed would create a land use conflict. 
                  The determination is first reviewed by "the Affected(s)" professional planning staff or appointee(s) in the absence of a planning staff. "The Affected(s)" planning staff or appointee(s) shall notify "The Initiator" and "the Affected(s)" governing body within fifteen (15) business days after "the Initiator" serves notification of their intent to object recommendation. The notification shall be a written recommendation based on bona fide land use classification objections. 
                  Prior to the end of the "the Affected" review period, i.e., the thirty (30) business days, "the Affected(s)" governing body shall consider the intent to object recommendation for final action. 
                  If "the Affected(s)" governing body confirms by an affirmative vote an objection as permitted for herein, "the Affected" shall document in writing the nature of the objection and the documentation shall be submitted to "the Initiator" prior to the end of the review period. 
                  The absence of said notification by "the Affected" shall be construed to mean that "the Affected" does not identify land use conflicts created by the annexation and "the Initiator" may proceed with the annexation, in compliance with applicable State or local laws and ordinances. 
                  5)  Mitigation. Representatives of "the Affected" and "the Initiator", which shall be selected by the governing bodies to act on their behalf, shall have ten (10) business days from "the Initiator's" receipt of the objections to meet and devise mitigative measures to address the specific use conflicts created by the proposed annexation. Such mitigative measures can include, but not be limited to, more restrictive development standards such as increasing buffers and/or building setbacks, building height, landscaping requirements, traffic control, storm water control, or other measures designed to mitigate conflicts resulting from adjacent land uses. 
                  Governing bodies of "the Affected" and "the Initiator" shall approve any mitigative actions identified during the mitigation process at their next available public meeting, but no later than fifteen (15) business days after the mitigative actions are identified by local representatives. 
                  Once "the Initiator" and "the Affected" agree that the mitigative measures are reasonable to address the specific use conflicts created by the proposed annexation then "the Initiator" shall impose said condition as prescribed in the selected mitigative measures as conditions of approval for the annexation of the property. 
                  6)  Appeals board. If at the end of the mitigation process "the Initiator" and "the Affected" cannot agree to a resolution of the objection through mitigative measures, then the dispute shall be referred to a Board of Annexation Appeals which shall be composed of five (5) members (unless more than one (1) affected local government is involved): two (2) appointed by "the Initiator"; two (2) appointed by "the Affected", and one (1) who must be a certified AICP planning professional or a professional from the DCA mediator list approved by both "the Initiator" and "the Affected". If more than one (1) municipality qualifies as an "Affected Local Government" each "Affected" may appoint two (2) members. The Board of Annexation Appeals must be appointed no later than fifteen (15) business days after "the Initiator" and "the Affected" have failed to agree on mitigative measures. Members of the Board of Annexation Appeals may not be an elected official or staff member of the respective governing authorities that are party to this resolution process. 
                  All cost associated with the work of the Board of Annexation Appeals shall be equally borne by the "the Initiator" and "the Affected(s)". 
                  7)  Board decision. Within ten (10) business days of appointment, the Board of Annexation Appeals shall render its decision, which shall be in the form of one following alternative: 
                  a.  Approve the annexation based on the land use classification proposed. 
                  b.  Deny the annexation based on the land use classification objection. 
                  c.  Approve the annexation based on the proposed mitigative action. 
                  The decision of the appeals board must be acted upon by the governing bodies of "the Initiator" and "the Affected" at their next available public meeting, but not later than fifteen (15) business days after the receipt of board recommendation. 
                  8)  Mediation. If "the Initiator" and "the Affected(s)" fail to reach an agreement on the administrative decision by the Board of Annexation Appeals, then within ten (10) business days "the Initiator" and "the Affected(s)" hereby agree to mutually select a mediator from the list maintained by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs or other mutually agreed upon source, and to undertake a mediation process in conformance with the standards and procedures established by the Georgia Planning Act. The cost and any associated expense shall be equally borne by "the Initiator" and "the Affected(s)". 
                  The mediator shall have up to fifteen (15) business days to render its decision, which shall be in the form of one (1) of the following alternatives: 
                  a.  Recommend acceptance of the annexation as proposed. 
                  b.  Recommend rejection of the proposed annexation. 
                  c.  Recommend alternatives and/or mitigation to resolve the objections to the proposed land use of the area to be annexed. 
                  The mediator's proposal must be approved by the governing bodies of both "the Initiator" and "the Affected" at the first available public meetings for each respective body, but not later than fifteen (15) business days after the mediator's recommendations are presented. 
                  "The Initiator" and "the Affected" hereby agree to comply with decision(s) resulting from the mediation process unless either "the Initiator" or "the Affected" chooses to seek legal remedy in a court of competent jurisdiction, which results in a different decision by the courts. 
                  9)  Annexation proceedings. Nothing in this process shall prohibit "the Initiator" from proceeding with its annexation process subject to the final outcome of this process; however, "the Initiator" shall not finalize the annexation until such time as the process for land use compatibility terminates. Nothing in these procedures shall preclude the rights of any property owner, "the Initiator", or "the Affected" to seek legal remedy in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  3.  Building permits. No permits shall be issued for construction of a building on newly annexed property until the City of West Point receives clearance on the annexation request from the U.S. Department of Justice as required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended. 
                  (Ord. No. 2007-10, 3-12-07) 
                  Section 26. - Board of adjustment. 
                  1.  Creation, membership and organization: A board of adjustment is hereby established. The word "board" when used in this ordinance shall be construed to mean the board of adjustment. 
                  The board shall consist of five (5) members appointed by the city council for overlapping terms of three (3) years and be removable for cause by the city council upon written charges and after public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the initial appointment. None of the members shall hold any other public office or position in the city, except that one member may be also a member of the municipal planning board. 
                  The board shall elect one (1) of its members as chairman, who shall serve for one (1) year or until he is re-elected or his successor is elected. The board shall appoint a secretary who may be an officer of the city council or of the municipal planning board.

                  The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent, or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record. 
                  3.  Appeals: Appeals to the board maybe taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the building inspector, code enforcement officer or planning director. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the building inspector, code enforcement officer, planning director and with the board a notice of appeal specifying the ground thereof. The building inspector, code enforcement officer or planning director shall forthwith transmit to the board all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. Each appeal shall be accompanied by a fee, as determined by the city council and listed in the schedule of fees maintained in the city clerk's office, to defray the cost of processing such appeal, said fee to be paid to the City Clerk of West Point. 
                  4.  Stay of proceedings: An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the building inspector, code enforcement officer, or planning director certifies to the board that the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the building inspector, code enforcement officer or planning director and on due cause shown. 
                  5.  Hearing on appeal: The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matter referred to it, and give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest and decide the same within a reasonable time (not to exceed sixty (60) days). Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. 
                  6.  Powers of the board: The board of adjustment shall have the following powers: 
                  (a)  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the building inspector, code enforcement officer or planning director in the enforcement of this ordinance, or any amendments thereto. 
                  (b)  To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this ordinance upon which the board is required to pass under this ordinance. Such special exceptions shall include and be limited to the following: 
                  (1)  Permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot or tract held in a single ownership at the time of the passage of this ordinance. 
                  (2)  Interpret the provisions of this ordinance where the street layout, actually on the ground, varies from the street layout as shown on the "Official Zoning Plan Map of the City of West Point." 
                  (3)  Permit the reconstruction of a non-conforming building which has been destroyed, or partially destroyed by fire or act of God, where the board shall find some compelling public necessity requiring a continuance of the non-conforming use. 
                  (4)  Permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises in any location for a public service corporation for public utility purposes which the board finds reasonably necessary for the public convenience or welfare. 
                  (c)  To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance maybe granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board that: 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography, and the application of this ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship, and such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved, and relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this ordinance, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance. 
                  (2)  The authorization of the variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or materially increase the congestion in public streets, or increase the public danger of fire and safety, or materially diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the City of West Point. 
                  7.  Modification of decisions appealed from: In exercising the above mentioned powers, the board by the concurring vote of four (4) members may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the building inspector, code enforcement officer or planning director and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. 
                  8.  Appeals from action of the board: Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the board, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the governing body of the City of West Point, may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board, otherwise the decision of the board will be final.

                  Section 27. - Administration and enforcement. 
                  1.  Enforcement: The building inspector, code enforcement officer, or planning director is hereby designated and authorized to enforce this ordinance. 
                  2.  Building permits: Each application for a building permit shall be accompanied by a plat in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the size, shape and location of the building to be erected and such other information as may be necessary to provide for the enforcement of this ordinance. A record of such applications and plats shall be kept in the office of the city clerk. Where application is made to enlarge an existing non-conforming use, the application shall be accompanied by an affidavit giving the description of the premises owned at the date of the passage of this ordinance.

                  Section 28. - Interpretation, purpose and conflict. 
                  In interpreting and applying the provisions of this ordinance, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community. It is not intended by this ordinance, to interfere with or abrogate or annual any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties; provided, however, that where this ordinance imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the height of buildings, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or required by other ordinances, rules, regulations or by easements, covenants, or agreements, the provisions of this ordinance shall control. 
                  (Ord. No. 2007-10, 3-12-07) 
                  Section 29. - Violations and penalties. 
                  Any person, firm or corporation who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this ordinance shall be punished as provided by section 1-14 of this Code. Each day that a violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense.
