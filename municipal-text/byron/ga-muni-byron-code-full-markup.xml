PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Byron, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1987 Code, as supplemented through September 11, 2000, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1987 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Philip Twelves, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Betty Sims, City Clerk-Treasurer, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  Editor's note— Printed herein is the Byron City Charter, as set out in 1941 Ga. Laws (Act No. 42), page 1210, approved February 13, 1941, as amended. An Act approved January 17, 1953, (1953 Ga. Laws (Act No. 230), Jan.-Feb. sess., page 2579) changed the "Town of Byron" to the "City of Byron," and this change has been made throughout the charter without notation. Other amendments to the charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

                  Bonds. When a bond is required by law, an undertaking in writing, without seal, is sufficient; and in all bonds where the names of the obligators do not appear in the bond, but are subscribed thereto, they are bound thereby.

If the last day falls on Saturday or Sunday, the party having such privilege or duty shall have through the following Monday to exercise the privilege or to discharge the duty. When the last day prescribed for such action falls on a public and legal holiday as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 1-4-1, as amended, the party having the privilege or duty shall have through the next business day to exercise the privilege or to discharge the duty.

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  (a)  If a wrecker service which has been included by the police department on the approved call list fails to meet the requirements provided for in this article or violates any of the approval specifications, the chief of police shall have the authority to remove the wrecker service from the approved call list. If the chief of police determines to remove a wrecker service from the approved call list, it will be notified in writing by the chief of police. The wrecker service may be excluded from the approved call list for a period not exceeding one year, at which time the wrecker service may make application to be returned to the rotation list.

Failure of the wrecker service to request a hearing within the specified time shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing, and the chief of police's decision shall be final. 
                  (c)  If requested, a hearing shall be held within 45 days after the date of the filing of the request for a hearing with the city council. The wrecker service shall be provided five days' advance written notice of the hearing date by hand delivery or certified mail, return receipt requested. At such hearing the wrecker service shall have the right to be represented by an attorney, at its expense, and to present evidence and cross examine witnesses. Upon hearing the facts, if the council finds that the alleged violations have not been proven, the wrecker service shall be returned to the approved call list and placed at the bottom of the list, as it then exists. If the council finds that the violations are proven, the decision of the chief of police shall be upheld.

After ten days' notice in writing has been served on the principal and surety, by personal service if such principal and surety are in the city; if either or both are out of the city, by written notice published in a public place in the city.

To such end the city jail shall continue to be used as the city prison, and the jail building and the inmates legally placed therein shall be under the supervision and control of the chief of police. The city may use the common jail of the county as the city prison under such arrangement as the city authorities may make with the county authorities.

                  (3)  Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the mayor finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the mayor shall execute and file with the city clerk a document marking the end of the state of emergency.

                  3.  The police chief (see subsection 15-32(a)(4)a.1.) is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the city; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification by the city governing authority. 
                  4.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city who requests entry for purposes of evaluating sites involved with emergency management functions to protect the health, safety or welfare of the public, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties.

                  8.  To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means; provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes;

                  Sec. 16-124. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 16-124(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and se walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along with any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph, maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as useable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this article and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2016-7 , 12-12-2016) 
                  Sec. 16-125. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the public works director to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the public works director and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 16-124(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
                  (3)  A fee shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area, as set forth in the schedule of fees approved by the mayor and council. 
                  (4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 16-124(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 16-125(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement, which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 16-124(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 16-124(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 16-125(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits of the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 16-126. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The public works director, or other qualified city employee designated by the public works director will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The public works director, or other qualified city employee designated by the public works director shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities, which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 16-127. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 16-125(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Sec. 16-161. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  (2)  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (3)  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (4)  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or credits; 
                  (5)  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
                  (6)  Therefore, the City of Byron has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with development stormwater runoff. 
                  (b)  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. These standards for the design of storm drainage systems are established to forestall flooding and ponding of water on streets, lots, building sites, dwellings and sites for drain fields of subsurface sewage disposal systems and to prevent erosion. In addition, these standards are designed to prevent damage from increased water runoff and changed drainage patterns created by the subdivision of land. It has been determined that proper management of development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
                  (1)  New development that involves the creation of 10,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
                  (2)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 10,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
                  (3)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the City of Byron to be a hotspot land use; or 
                  (4)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in subsections (1) and (2) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  (b)  The following activities are exempt from this article: 
                  (1)  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
                  (2)  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
                  (3)  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
                  (4)  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the City of Byron.

                  Sec. 16-164. - Drainage and stormwater management systems. 
                  (a)  The size of storm sewers shall not be based solely on present needs, but rather on a regional perspective, taking into account the population density of the drainage basin. The city may require the subdivider to provide storm and floodwater runoff channels or natural storage basins, such as tanks, infiltration pits, dry wells, or gravel layers independent of the sanitary sewer system based on the location of the subdivision. Where detention facilities are deemed necessary, they should accommodate site runoff generated by the two-year, ten-year and 100-year storms considered individually. Detention shall be provided such that after development, the peak rate of flow from the site will not exceed the corresponding flows, which have been created by similar storms prior to the development. 
                  (b)  A subdivision plan that minimizes paved areas and other impervious surfaces and attempts to preserve existing vegetation will decrease the need for expensive water retention measures. 
                  (c)  All storm drainage design shall be planned and executed so as to preserve natural topographic features and vegetative cover, to minimize change to existing topography, and to preserve natural drainage systems. 
                  (1)  Where an adequate public storm sewer is available at the plat boundary, the subdivider shall construct a stormwater management system and connect with such storm sewer line. If such a stormwater management system is not accessible, natural drainage channels with easements of adequate width shall be provided as determined and approved by the city. Storm drainage from lots, including drain tile around basements, shall not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewer facility, but shall connect to an adequate drainage outlet. 
                  (2)  The subdivider shall construct all necessary facilities including underground pipes, inlets, catch basins, or open drainage ditches, as determined by the city, to provide for the adequate disposal of subsurface and surface water and maintenance of natural drainage courses. The Best Available Technology (BAT) shall be used to minimize off-site stormwater runoff, increase on-site filtration, encourage natural filtration functions, simulate natural drainage systems and minimize off-site discharge of pollutants to ground and surface water. Best Available Technology (BAT) may include measures such as retention basins, recharge trenches, porous paving and piping, contour terraces and swales. Stormwater management shall follow the standards established by the State of Georgia Environmental Protection Division. Subdivision development shall not increase the rate of runoff and an increase in the volume of runoff shall require a reduction in the rate of runoff. 
                  (3)  When necessary, outlet ditches of closed storm sewers on an approved type and size shall be required as part of the construction. If same is across private property, rights-of-way or easements shall be obtained by the subdivider for the construction and future maintenance. These rights-of-way or easements shall be shown on the construction plans. Whenever possible, post-development drainage patterns shall be the same as pre-development drainage patterns. The design of streets and grading shall be such that runoff from roofs, driveways and other impervious surfaces will be collected in ditches and/or gutters in short runs 300 feet to 400 feet in length. The runoff shall then be diverted from the surface, if not already underground, into storm sewers or a natural watercourse. Streets shall be located away from watercourses unless storm sewers are to be installed. The channel downstream of the subdivision shall be improved adequately by the subdivider to convey the storm runoff from the subdivision and across the adjacent property owner so that damages from flooding are minimized. 
                  (4)  The subdivider shall guard against the creation or continuation of swampy areas or stagnant pools, unless they are a component of a designed wetlands open space. The city may require fill, swale and/or channel improvements in order to forestall such problems. 
                  (5)  Adequate measures for the protection of open and closed drainage channels shall be provided. Maintenance easements widths shall be determined by the city. The velocity flow on an open ditch shall not exceed four feet per second in soil ditches or six feet per second in grassed ditches. Paved ditches will be required if velocities of flow are greater than those specified, or if it is otherwise likely that destructive erosion will result. Drainage ditches shall not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewer facility. 
                  (6)  No watercourse shall be altered in such a way as to change the amount or direction of flow, no fill, building or structures shall be situated in natural water courses unless provision is made for the flow of water in a manner satisfactory to the city. 
                  (7)  Maintenance of all stormwater management systems shall remain the responsibility of the owner.

                  Sec. 16-169. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
                  (1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
                  c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (2)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  b.  Twenty-four hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; and 
                  c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (3)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection 16-169(2) is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  (4)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  (5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection 16-169(1). The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (7)  Drainage system guidelines.

                  ARTICLE VII. - ILLICIT STORM SEWER SYSTEM DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION 

                  Sec. 16-260. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Discharges to the city's storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city's storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city's storm sewer system. 
                  (2)  Therefore, the City of Byron adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the city's storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city's storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
                  (3)  The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the city's storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by state and federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the city's storm sewer system in order to among other requirements comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to: 
                  a.  Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the city's storm sewer system by any person; 
                  b.  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the city's storm sewer system; 
                  c.  Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the city's storm sewer system; and, 
                  d.  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
                  (b)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.

                  Sec. 16-367. - General requirements for grease interceptors. 
                  Grease interceptors shall be installed by users as required by the director of public works or his designee. Grease interceptors shall be installed at the user's expense, when such user operates a cooking establishment. Grease interceptors may also be required in non-cooking or cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs establishments and other industrial or commercial establishments when they are deemed necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease. All grease interceptors shall be of a type, design and capacity approved by the director of public works, or his designee, and shall be readily and easily accessible for user cleaning and inspection by the city. All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain minimum design capability or effective volume of the grease interceptor, but not less often than every 30 days. Users who are required to pass water through a grease interceptor shall: 
                  (1)  Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes at actual peak flow or 12 minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate as predicted by the Uniform Plumbing Code fixture criteria, between the influent and effluent baffles with 20 percent of the total volume of the grease interceptor being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate, identified hereafter as a "sludge pocket". 
                  (2)  Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required, but at intervals of not longer than 30 days at the users expense. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the grease interceptor. 
                  (3)  Accept the following conditions: If any skimmed or pumped wastes or other materials removed from grease interceptor are treated in any fashion onsite and reintroduced back into the grease interceptor as an activity of and after said on-site treatment, the user shall be responsible for the attainment of established grease numerical limit consistent with and contained in section 16-366 on all discharges of wastewater from said grease interceptor into the city's wastewater collection system. 
                  (4)  Operate the grease interceptor in a manner so as to maintain said device such that attainment of the grease limit is consistently achieved. "Consistent" shall mean any wastewater sample taken from said grease interceptor shall be subject to terms of numerical limit attainment described in section 16-366. If an establishment desires, because of documented space constraints, an alternate to an out-of-building grease interceptor, the request for an alternative location shall contain the following information: 
                  a.  Location of city sewer main and easement in relation to available exterior space outside the building. 
                  b.  Existing plumbing at or on a site that uses common plumbing for all services at that site. 
                  (5)  Understand and agree that: The use of biological additives as a grease degradation agent is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by the director of public works or his designee. Any establishment using this method of grease abatement shall maintain the trap or interceptor in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the trap's outlet, is consistently achieved. 
                  (6)  Understand and agree that: The use of automatic grease removal systems is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by the director of public works, or his designee, the plumbing inspector for the City of Byron and the Peach County Health Department. Any establishment using this equipment shall operate the system in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the unit's outlet, is consistently achieved. 
                  (7)  Understand and agree that: The city reserves the right to make determinations of grease interceptor adequacy and need, based on review of all relevant information regarding grease interceptor performance, facility site and building plan review and to require repairs to, or modification or replacement of such traps.

                  (1)  Users that are required to install a fats, oils and grease recovery system shall be responsible for the cleaning and maintenance of the fats, oils and grease recovery systems located on the property. The user shall be responsible for maintaining any grease recovery system pursuant to subsection (2) below and in such a manner that the grease discharge shall not exceed the city's discharge limits. The currently adopted limits shall be on file at the office of the City clerk and at the office of the public works director. 
                  (2)  The user shall maintain accurate records (manifests and logs) of the dates of cleaning and the means of disposal of fats, oils and grease. These records are subject to inspection and review by the city pursuant to and in accordance with section 16-364. 
                  (3)  Any removal and hauling of fats, oils and grease shall be performed by a licensed waste disposal or rendering firm. If the grease recovery system fails to prevent discharge over the daily maximum, the city will require the user to repair, replace or upgrade their grease removal system, which may include one or more of the user's devices, at the user's expense. 
                  (4)  All costs related to the building's sewer installation, grease recovery system or connection and registration shall be borne by the user. 
                  (5)  The user shall be required to sign an acknowledgment form furnished by the city, attesting to the user's understanding of the aforementioned responsibility. 
                  (b)  Grease trap maintenance. 
                  (1)  All grease traps shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete recovery of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater and bottom sludges and solids. All grease recovery systems, including passive exterior devices, and any grease recovery devices, shall be properly and adequately maintained by the user so as to achieve the intended purpose of the device.

                  (b)  Notice of noncompliance. If through inspection, it is determined that the user has failed to comply with the provisions of this section, a written warning of the violation shall be given to the user, the contractor named in the permit, or the user's authorized agent. The notice shall set forth the violation and the measure needed to achieve compliance. The user shall have seven days from receipt of this notice to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply. 
                  (c)  Failure to comply. The city shall have the power and authority to enter upon the property of any user who, after having received a written warning, has failed to comply with the provisions of this article, and take the following actions: 
                  (1)  The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. 
                  Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city may reinstate the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within 15 days of the date of the occurrence. 
                  (2)  Whenever, the city finds that any user has violated or is violating this article, or any prohibition, or limitation of requirements contained herein, the city may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days of the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user. 
                  (3)  If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the city's wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this article or federal or state pretreatment requirements, or any order of the city, the city attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief. 
                  (d)  Penalty. 
                  (1)  Any user who is found to have violated any provision of this section, and the orders, rules, and regulations issued hereunder, shall be fined in the municipal court of the city a fine of not less than $300.00. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. 
                  (2)  Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article and the sewer use ordinance, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article or the sewer use ordinance, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both. 
                  (e)  Overflow penalty. Any sewer or manhole overflow traced to an inadequately operating grease recovery system or lack of a grease recovery system will result in a service charge to the user. The service charge shall include the cost of cleaning up the overflow and for cleaning grease out of the immediately adjacent contaminated city wastewater collection system. This penalty shall not impede other enforcement actions as deemed appropriate by the city. Additionally, the user shall be responsible for payment of any fine levied by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division against the City of Byron as a result of overflows in the city's wastewater collection system caused by grease traced to any inadequate or absent grease recovery system. 
                  Except as provided herein, for a period of six months following adoption of this article, although installation of grease interceptors will be required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this article for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from grease interceptors. If during this six-month period an obstruction of a city's sewer main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease in the city's sewer main(s), the city will take appropriate enforcement actions against the generator or contributor of such grease. 
                  In the event there is any conflict between the provisions of this section and the provisions of the Standard Plumbing Code (SBCCI) incorporated by reference in section 8-1, the provisions of this section shall take precedence.

                  Sec. 16-406. - Procedure for declaring dwelling unfit. 
                  (a)  (1)  Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the municipality charging that any dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure or property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties for such dwelling, building or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction as determined by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain and at a place within the city where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days, nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing; 
                  (2)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  a.  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to bring it up into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  b.  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia Appraiser Classification as provided in O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq., qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the city. 
                  (3)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building or structure the public officer may cause such dwelling, building or structure to be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or section 16-407 of this article, or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe condition. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (4)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; and 
                  (5)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (b)  (1)  The lien provided for in subsection (a)(5) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(c) and subsection 16-405(c) of this article. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except all liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  (2)  Upon final determination of costs, fees and expenses incurred in accordance with this article, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this article shall transmit to the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition or closure. It shall be the duty of the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. A county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to the article in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county or municipality whose lien is being collected. 
                  (3)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
                  (4)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this article shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this article together with interest, penalties and costs incurred by the governing authority, county tax commissioner, municipal tax collector, or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (c)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (d)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement or demolition of a dwelling, building or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (e)  In addition to the procedures and remedies in this chapter, a governing authority may provide by ordinance that designated public officers may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article. 
                  (f)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings.

                  Any person affected by any order issued by the public officer may petition to the superior court for an injunction restraining the public officer from carrying out the provisions of the order. The court may, upon such petition, issue a temporary injunction restraining the public officer pending the final disposition of the cause; provided, however, that such person shall present the petition to the court within 15 days of the posting and service of the order by the public officer.

                  Sec. 20-31. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and City Council of Byron, Georgia, do ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. No. 2008-12, 9-24-2008) 
                  Sec. 20-32. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Byron, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 2008-12, 9-24-2008) 
                  Sec. 20-33. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 20-96. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor, formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  (i)  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  (ii)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  (iii)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 20-97. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 20-96(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 20-73(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels; (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  (ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (see subsection 20-96(6), above). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on-sites must either: 
                  (i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  (ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick, disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  (iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a.—c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 20-52, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. 
                  Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection(4)a., above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4. 
                  (Ord. No. 2008-12, 9-24-2008) 
                  Sec. 20-98. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 20-52, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 20-52, then the director of public works shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions ((2) and (3)) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 20-96(4) "Elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The director of public works shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 20-52, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 20-96(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  The director of public works shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 20-72(1)c. and 20-72(2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 20-126. - [Variances.] 
                  (a)  The zoning review board as established by the City of Byron shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the director of public works in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the director of public works may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Peach County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the zoning review board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The director of public works shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the zoning review board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is;

                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.

                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after May 7, 1985 and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure. [i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for community participation in the (NFIP)]. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after May 7, 1985. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) as corrected in 1988, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis;

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be; (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include; (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (a)  A person commits the offense of loitering or prowling when he is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.

Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

                  (a)  A person who shall be and appear in an intoxicated condition in any public place or within the curtilage of any private residence not his own, other than by invitation of the owner or lawful occupant, which condition is made manifest by boisterousness; by indecent condition or act; or by vulgar, profane, loud or unbecoming language, commits the unlawful offense of public intoxication.

                  Article II, section 40. Actuarial equivalent shall mean a benefit of approximately equal value when computed on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in article VIIA. 
                  Article II, section 44. Disability shall mean a physical or mental disability of a participant, if the pension committee shall determine that the participant is permanently and totally incapacitated on the basis of certificates signed by two physicians selected and engaged by the disabled participant and stating that (a) such participant is permanently and totally physically or mentally disabled by anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities that are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, so as to be prevented from engaging in any occupation or employment whatsoever for remuneration or profit; (b) such disability commenced on a specified date during the period of the participant's employment with the city; (c) such disability will be permanent and continuous during the remainder of the participant's life; and (d) such disability was not self-inflicted, incurred in military service, incurred in the commission of a felonious enterprise, or the result of the use of narcotics or drugs or habitual alcoholism. The pension committee shall have the right to require a participant who is under disability to be examined by a physician chosen by the pension committee to confirm the continuation of a disability. 
                  Article II, section 45.

A participant may retire under the provisions of the plan, regardless of any age or service restrictions otherwise contained herein, on the first day of the calendar month coinciding with or next following the date a participant's employment is terminated due to a disability. Upon actual retirement, such participant shall receive the disability retirement benefit provided in article V, section 4, or any other retirement benefit granted under the plan for which participant is eligible if such benefit is greater than the aforesaid disability retirement benefit. However, under no circumstances shall any retired participant be entitled at one time to more than one type of retirement benefit granted under the plan. 
                  Article V, section 2. Early retirement benefit. A participant, upon retirement on participant's early retirement date, shall receive a monthly retirement benefit under which payment shall commence on the first day of the month following the participant's early retirement date and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter during the lifetime of the participant. The amount of such monthly retirement benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal retirement benefit, but reduced on an actuarially equivalent basis in accordance with the actuarial tables as contained in article VIIA, section 1. 
                  Article V, section 8. Limitation on annual benefit. A participant's annual benefit shall not exceed a dollar amount specified under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 415(b)(1)(A) as adjusted under IRC section 415(d) based upon section 215(i)(2)(A) of the social security act. If a participant's total annual benefits are not in excess of $10,000.00 this section shall not apply. Furthermore, if the participant retires before age 62 the limit shall be actuarially reduced in accordance with IRC section 415(b)(2)(C)—(I). 
                  Article VI, section 2. Description of options. The amount of any optional retirement benefit set forth below shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit that would otherwise be payable to the participant under article V. 
                  Option A: Joint and survivor option. A decreased retirement benefit which shall be payable during the lifetime of the participant and, if participant's joint annuitant should survive participant, shall continue after his death during the lifetime of participant's joint annuitant in the same amount or in such smaller amount as the participant may designate. If the joint annuitant does not survive the participant, all payment shall cease at the death of the participant and no further benefits will accrue to participant's estate or to other persons except as provided in article VII, section 2.

The lien of the occupation tax shall become fixed on and shall date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the city marshal upon the property of the defendant located in the jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of the execution, with interest and costs.

If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

All amounts of such tax shall be due and payable to the city clerk monthly on or before the 20th day of the month next succeeding the respective monthly period. The tax shall become delinquent for any monthly period after the 20th day of each succeeding month during which it remains unpaid. 
                  (b)  Penalty and interest for failure to pay tax by due date. A lodging provider who fails to make any return or to pay the amount of tax as prescribed, shall be assessed a specific penalty to be added to the tax in the amount of five percent or $5.00, whichever is greater, if the failure is for one month or less; and an additional five percent or $5.00, whichever is greater, for each additional month or fraction thereof in which such failure shall continue; provided, however, that the aggregate penalty for any single violation shall not exceed 25 percent or $25.00, whichever is greater. Delinquent amounts shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, until paid. 
                  (c)  Acceptance of delinquent return and remittance without imposing penalty and interest; authority; requirements. If the failure to make any return or to pay the amount of tax by the due date results from providential cause shown to the satisfaction of the governing authority of the city by affidavit attached to the return, and remittance is made within ten days of the due date, such return may be accepted exclusive of penalty and interest. 
                  (d)  Waiving of penalty and interest; authority. O.C.G.A. § 48-2-41, relating to the authority to waive interest, and O.C.G.A. § 48-2-43, relating to the authority to waive penalty, shall apply; provided, however, that the governing authority shall stand in lieu of the Georgia Commissioner of Revenue, and the city shall stand in lieu of the state. 
                  (e)  Penalty for fraud. In the case of a false or fraudulent return, or of failure to file a return where willful intent exists to defraud the city of any tax due, a penalty of 50 percent shall be assessed. 
                  (f)  Return; remittance; time of filing; lodging providers required to file; contents.

However, if the estimated tax liability for any monthly period shall exceed $2,500.00 for a lodging provider who, in the prior fiscal year remitted tax greater than $2,500.00 in any three consecutive months, such lodging provider shall file an estimated return and remit not less than 50 percent of the estimated tax liability for the monthly period by the 20th day of that same monthly period. The amount of tax so remitted shall be credited against the amount to be due with the regular return for the monthly period to be filed on the 20th day of the succeeding month. 
                  (g)  Extension of time of filing; authority; requirements; remittance; penalty and interest. The governing authority of the city may, for good cause, extend the time for making returns for not longer than 30 days. No extension shall be valid unless granted in writing upon written application of the lodging provider. Such grant may not be applicable for a longer period than 12 consecutive months. A lodging provider granted an extension shall remit tax equaling not less than 100 percent of the tax paid for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year; such remittance to be made on or before the date the tax would otherwise come due without the grant of extension. No penalty or interest shall be charged during the first ten days of the extension period. Thereafter, interest shall be collected on the unpaid balance at the rate of one percent per month. 
                  (h)  Collection fee allowed lodging providers. Lodging providers collecting the tax shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting and paying the amount due, if the amount is not delinquent at the time of payment. The rate of the deduction shall be three percent of the amount due, but only if the amount due was not delinquent at the time of payment.

                  Sec. 40-90. - Maintenance responsibility for sewer lines. 
                  (a)  The city has maintenance responsibility for pumping stations, sewer manholes, mainlines connecting the manholes, and service connections at the main. Unlike water and gas lines that have meters to establish boundaries of responsibility, sewer lines do not have meters. Therefore, city responsibility for service connections is established at the mainline, and if mainlines are located under street pavement, a distance from the mainline extending to the street edge. 
                  (b)  The homeowner/business owner has maintenance responsibility for the service line which connects the building to the city mainline. The first action to correct a sewer problem is for the owner to arrange for someone other than the city to check the fixtures within the building, then the service line up to the connection at the main, at or under the street. A sewer blockage in the service line is to be cleared by the owner or person contracted to do so. In no case will a homeowner or contractor be allowed to dig at or under the street pavement to repair a service line. 
                  (c)  For all newly installed service connections, a cleanout port will be located at or near the street edge to facilitate future maintenance of the service line connection at the main sewer line.

                  (5)  Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or 
                  (6)  Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft. 
                  (b)  In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect an application for a new account, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft.

                  ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

                  Sec. 40-190. - Findings. 
                  The mayor and city council make the following findings of fact: 
                  (1)  The city is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III (a)(6) thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services throughout the city. 
                  (2)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the government of the city hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services. 
                  (3)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, the city is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the state and the City Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. 
                  (4)  Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within the city. 
                  (5)  A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas. 
                  (6)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
                  (7)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the city thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. 
                  (8)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels of treatment requirements imposed on the city wastewater treatment facilities and increased water treatment cost of potable water supplies by the city. 
                  (9)  Proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing development as well as future development and redevelopment in the city. 
                  (10)  The city is required under federal and state regulations (i.e., the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II Georgia Notice of Intent (NOI) and stormwater permit effective December 2012 to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature. 
                  (11)  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES phase II stormwater permit, along with other city stormwater program activities, will substantially increase the cost of providing stormwater management services above what is currently being spent for water quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood control and other program activities. 
                  (12)  The cost of operating and maintaining the city stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. 
                  (13)  The professional engineering and financing analysis, known as the stormwater utility rate study (including amendments) and related documents, dated April 2017 and prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer, which report is incorporated herein by express reference, properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, defines the city's stormwater management program funding strategy. 
                  (14)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
                  (15)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (16)  The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways as described in the stormwater utility implementation report. 
                  (17)  The services and benefits rendered, or resulting from provision of stormwater management services, may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof. 
                  (18)  A stormwater management program (SWMP) provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described in the stormwater utility feasibility study dated December 2016, and the other related documents, that have been prepared for the city by its consultants. 
                  (19)  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
                  (20)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city's SWMP, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility manager. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property. 
                  (21)  The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. 
                  (22)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

                  Sec. 40-191. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto. 
                  Credit means a reduction in the amount of a stormwater user fee charge to the owner of a particular property for the existence and use of privately owned, maintained and operated on-site or off-site stormwater systems or facilities, or continuing provision of services or activities that reduce or mitigate the city's cost of providing stormwater management services for that particular property. 
                  Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the services provided by the city's SWMP and the stormwater utility, including local, state, and federal governments. These services include, but are not necessarily limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities. 
                  Dwelling unit shall mean a structure, which contains one or more bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen facility. 
                  Equivalent residential unit (ERU) means the statistical average horizontal impervious surface area of a detached single-family residential property within the city as of the date of adoption of this article. The horizontal impervious surface area includes, but is not limited to, all areas covered by structures, roof extensions, patios, porches, driveways, and sidewalks. 
                  Government property shall include all local, state and federal government owned, operated, and maintained properties within the city. 
                  Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition. 
                  Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
                  Improved property means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 500 square feet of impervious surfaces. 
                  Non-residential property means improved property containing one or more non-residential structures as defined by the city's zoning classifications: A-1, C-1, C-2, C-3, C3-PUD, and I-1. A non-residential property may include a "stick-built," industrialized, or other type of structure located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Improved property may be classified as a non-residential property even if there is present incidental structures associated with non-residential uses such as garages, carports, storage buildings, cottages or barns, and impervious driveways and sidewalks. Non-residential properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for residential purposes. 
                  Public water influence zone means those areas lying downstream of a culvert or other stormwater management conveyance system. On the downstream side of the conveyance system, the public water influence zone will extend for a length of six times the diameter (or width) of the culvert from which runoff is being discharged (Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, current edition), and within the horizontal limits set forth in the aforementioned field manual. For example, if a 36-inch diameter culvert is discharging to a private property, the public water influence zone shall extend 18 feet (six times 36 inches) from the end of the culvert and for the specified width (i.e., typically the width of the creek). The city stormwater utility may perform maintenance and/or capital construction activities only within that portion of the public water influence zone which the city has an ownership interest in, or for which a dedicated easement has been granted to, and accepted by the city for such purpose. 
                  Residential property means improved property containing one or more residential structures as defined by the city's zoning classifications: R-1, R-2, R-3, R-MH, and R-PUD. A residential property may include a "stick-built," industrialized, or other type of home located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Improved property may be classified as a residential property even if there is present incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guesthouses, servants or caretakers quarters, cottages or barns, impervious driveways, sidewalks, or the presence of a commercial use within the residence, as long as such use does not result in additional areas of impervious surfaces. Residential properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for non-residential purposes. Property in an agricultural zoning classification may also be classified as "residential property" if it meets the definition of residential property herein. 
                  Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city. 
                  Stormwater management services means all services provided by the city which relate to the: 
                  (1)  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated portions of the city; 
                  (2)  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities; 
                  (3)  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs; 
                  (4)  Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems and facilities; and 
                  (5)  Compliance with applicable state and federal stormwater management regulations and permit requirements. 
                  Stormwater management services may address the quality of stormwater runoff as well as the quantity thereof. 
                  Stormwater management systems and facilities means those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey, detain, retain, treat or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
                  Stormwater user fee charge means the periodic user fee charge imposed pursuant to this article by the city stormwater utility for providing stormwater management services. This term shall exclude special charges to the owners of particular properties for services, systems or facilities related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects, on-site stormwater control systems and other stormwater management services provided by the city for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered. 
                  Stormwater utility manager means the person appointed by the mayor and city council to administer the provisions of this article. 
                  Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface, which impedes the infiltration of stormwater runoff or causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of 500 square feet or less of impervious surface. 
                  User means any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management. 
                  User classifications include residential, non-residential and government properties.

                  (a)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the city council. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, and together with other sources of support available to the city stormwater utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  (1)  The stormwater user fee charge shall be in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the mayor and council. The fee schedule pursuant to this article allows a $0.25 ERU rate increase each year for a period of ten years. 
                  (2)  Residential customer class. All residential properties shall be charged a flat rate equivalent to one ERU. 
                  (3)  Non-residential customer class. All non-residential properties as defined herein shall be billed one ERU for every 3,850 square foot increment, or portion thereof, of impervious surface. In cases where a fractional ERU is calculated, the total ERU for the customer account will be rounded down to the next whole number for billing. Increments of impervious surface less than 3,850 square feet shall not be billable except in the case of minimum bills (i.e., 500 to 3,849 square feet of impervious surface), which shall be billed at the rate for one ERU. For customers located within a development with shared common parking or other impervious surface, the amount of shared common impervious surface associated with the developed land shall be apportioned to the individual customer by a percentage of the impervious surface attributable to the customer as determined by the total common shared impervious surface times the percentage of the customer's square feet of leased, or owned, interior or exterior space to the total square feet within the development of interior, or exterior, space available for occupancy. Fractional ERUs for non-residential properties will be rounded to two decimal places to establish the actual number of ERUs for billing. 
                  (b)  The customers of the stormwater utility shall be billed for the stormwater user fee charges. The stormwater user fee charge may be billed on a common statement and collected along with other city public utility charges. The customer may be the occupant, owner or user who is billed by the city for public services, i.e., water, sewer, natural gas and/or sanitation. If the improved property does not receive any other city public utility services, or is not being charged for public utility services due to vacancy, or non-use, at the time of stormwater user fee billing, then the owner of the property, shall be billed for stormwater management services by the city. Regardless of whether or not the developed land has an occupant or user, the owner is ultimately responsible for payment of the stormwater user fee charges.

                  Sec. 40-197. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions. 
                  Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in the incorporated area of the city shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. 
                  Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows: 
                  (1)  Parcels which contain 500 square feet, or less, of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (2)  Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (3)  Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way and road systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other improved property used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. All other state, federal, and county properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties. 
                  (4)  The city (city owned) public streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by the city via the general fund. However, other improved property used for city purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (5)  Any property whereby 100 percent of the stormwater runoff is contained or infiltrated on the property and no stormwater runoff is discharged, via overland flow, into the city owned storm drainage system.

                  Sec. 40-198. - Stormwater user fee charge credits. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility manager shall grant credits or adjustments based on the technical and procedural criteria set forth in the stormwater utility credit technical manual. Copies of the credit technical manual will be maintained by and available from the stormwater utility manager. 
                  (1)  A stormwater user fee charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements, standards and criteria contained in the credit technical manual. The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the credit technical manual. 
                  (2)  Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the credit technical manual and/or upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The stormwater utility manager may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the credit technical manual or this article. 
                  (3)  In order to obtain a credit, the property owner must make application to the city on forms provided by the stormwater utility manager for such purpose, and in accordance with the procedures outlined in the credit technical manual. 
                  (4)  Property owners may apply for any credits and/or adjustments in accordance with the credit manual. 
                  (5)  The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, and be in the format established by the stormwater utility manager. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for consideration and processing. 
                  (b)  When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the stormwater utility manager, he shall have 30 days from the date the complete application is accepted to either grant the credit in whole, grant the credit in part, or deny the credit. Credits applied for by the property owner and granted in whole or in part, shall apply to all stormwater user fee charges in accordance with the terms defined in the credit technical manual.

                  Sec. 40-199. - Enforcement methods and inspections. 
                  (a)  All property owners of improved property within the incorporated areas of the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the city municipal court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the penalties set forth in section 16-172 of this Code. 
                  (b)  Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater utility manager the city may elect to sue in the city municipal court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the city municipal court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the city municipal court. 
                  (c)  The city shall have the right for its designated officers and employees to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law. Such inspections shall generally be limited to the following purposes: 
                  (1)  Inspecting or conducting engineering analyses on existing stormwater management systems and facilities located on site; or 
                  (2)  Determining that stormwater management systems and facilities need to be constructed.

                  Sec. 40-200. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments. 
                  Failure to receive a stormwater utility bill is not justification for non-payment. The property owner, as identified from public land records of Peach County, shall be obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property. 
                  (1)  Billing. 
                  a.  Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue as established by the mayor and council, and shall be billed prospectively. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater user fee charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due. 
                  b.  The stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected as deemed most effective and efficient by the city council. For example, the fee may be applied on each customer water bill. 
                  c.  Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by the city council. 
                  d.  Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each improved property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments. 
                  e.  If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of improved property, the city stormwater utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period. 
                  (2)  Delinquencies and collection. 
                  a.  Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment or cutting off water service until the delinquency is resolved. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner and/or the property. 
                  b.  A late charge shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility user fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner. 
                  (3)  Adjustments. The stormwater utility manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge. 
                  a.  If a customer believes their stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the stormwater utility manager and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. 
                  b.  Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information to the stormwater utility manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater utility manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request. 
                  c.  Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater utility manager, the stormwater utility manager shall have 30 calendar days within which to render a written decision. Concurrent payment of any charges allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to this request for review. 
                  d.  In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater utility manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater utility user fee charge for the property is correct. 
                  e.  The stormwater utility manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
                  f.  If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater bill.

                  Sec. 40-201. - Appeals, hearings. 
                  (a)  Appeals. An appeal to the mayor and city council may be taken by any property owner or customer aggrieved by any decision of the stormwater utility manager. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days of the decision of the stormwater utility manager by filing with the mayor and city council a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the stormwater utility manager shall forthwith transmit to the mayor and city council all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken. 
                  (b)  Hearing. The mayor and city council shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall indicate the place, date and time of the hearing. The mayor and city council shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the stormwater utility manager after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the stormwater utility manager is reversed in whole or in part, resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal. 
                  (c)  Decision final. The decision of the mayor and city council shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the mayor and city council may appeal that decision to the Superior Court of Peach County by writ of certiorari.

                  These articles apply to all incorporated areas in the City of Byron. 
                  Section 2. - Enactment and authority.

Upon determination of a violation, the zoning enforcement officer shall issue a "notice of violation" stating the nature of the violation and giving ten days to correct the violation or notify the zoning office of intent to appeal to the zoning board of appeals or giving adequate steps for correction and a time limit for the proposed corrections. If the violation continues more than ten days without notice of appeal or correction proposed, the zoning officer shall issue a citation to recorder's[municipal] court. If the violator does not appear at the time and place cited, the judge of recorder's[municipal] court shall send the police after that person responsible for the violation and place him or her under bond to appear at the next session of court.

As used in this ordinance, a variance is authorized only for height, area, and size of structure, and size of yards and open spaces; establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited shall not be allowed by variance, nor shall a variance be granted because of the presence of nonconformities in the zoning district of use(s), in adjoining zoning district. 
                  Yard. A yard is that portion of a lot extending open and unobstructed, except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, along the entire length of a lot line, and from the lot line for a depth or width set forth in the applicable district regulations.

                  1.  The applicant shall complete and submit to the building official the building permit application. The application will contain two copies of a scale drawing, signed by the property owner, or his/her agent, and illustrating all of the following:

All establishments planning to serve food or cook food to be consumed by humans must have a food service permit from the Peach County Health Department. Any mercantile building of 25,000 square feet or more must have approval by the planning commission and city council before a permit can be issued. 
                  2.  The zoning enforcement officer will review the application materials for compliance with the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations. 
                  3.  If the zoning enforcement officer or the building official finds the application not in compliance with the codes, administrative procedures and the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations, the building official shall not issue a permit, but shall return the documents to the applicant with his refusal to issue such permit. Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. The applicant must correct the deficiency, or may appeal to the construction board of adjustment and appeals. 
                  4.  If the zoning enforcement officer and the building official find the application in compliance with the codes, administrative procedures, and the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations, then the building permit will be issued to the applicant. 
                  5.  An application for a permit for any proposed work shall be deemed to have been abandoned six months after the date of filing for the permit, unless before then a permit has been issued. One or more extensions of time for periods of not more than 90 days each may be allowed by the building official for the application, provided the extension is requested in writing and justifiable cause is demonstrated. Should the applicant fail to commence work on the project for which the permit was issued within six months of the issuance date, or if work on the respective project is suspended for any reason for a period of six months, the respective building permit will become void and of no force or effect. 
                  6.  The building official, or his designee, will inspect all completed work for compliance with all applicable codes and the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations. 
                  7.  If the building official, or his designee, finds the completed work satisfactory, then a certificate of occupancy will be issued.

If more time for study or for requesting more information [is needed], the council shall decide no later than the next regularly scheduled meeting. 
                  7.  If the final action by the city council denies an application for amending the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations, regardless of the initial source of such application, the city council shall not: 
                  a.  Reconsider the same amendment proposal application if resubmitted by the original initiating person(s), or 
                  b.  Consider another amendment proposal application which pertains to that same portion(s) of the zoning ordinance or articles of subdivision regulation as the original amendment proposal application pertained to, 
                  within a calendar period of not less than six months from the date of the city council's final action of denying the original amendment proposal application. 
                  8.  If the final action by the city council denies an amendment application, the city council will provide in writing to the applicant a reasonable explanation of the reason(s) for denial of the application.

                  The written application must prove that: 
                  a.  Special conditions and/or circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structures, or required subdivision improvements involved, and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or required subdivision improvements; and 
                  b.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of these regulations would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties with similar conditions; and 
                  c.  The special conditions and/or circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; and 
                  d.  The granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by these regulations to other lands, structures, or required subdivision improvements under similar conditions. No preexisting conditions on neighboring lands which are contrary to these regulations shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
                  2.  The zoning enforcement officer will review the variance application for completeness, and compliance with the rules and regulations of the zoning and subdivision regulations ordinances. 
                  3.  The zoning enforcement officer and the chairman of the planning and zoning commission will schedule a public hearing to consider the proposed variance. 
                  4.  At the direction of the chairman of the planning and zoning commission, the city clerk will, at least 15 days prior to the public hearing, (a) post, in city hall, a notice containing the time, place, and proposed variance action to be considered at the public hearing, and (b) post, in plain view of the public, a similar notice upon the affected property. The clerk shall send notices to every landowner of adjacent property with respect to the subject property, stating the request and the reason for the request and the time and place of the public hearing at least ten days in advance of the public hearing. 
                  The cost of these two notification methods shall be included within the required administrative fee paid by the applicant, and shall be the same for any and all similar applications. 
                  5.  The public hearing for the proposed variance will be held, and minutes of the meeting will be kept. Minutes of the public hearing will become part of the variance application. 
                  6.  The zoning enforcement officer will submit his written review and recommendations, with the minutes of the public hearing, to the mayor and city council within 30 calendar days following the public hearing. 
                  7.  The zoning review board will decide whether to grant the variance within 30 calendar days following its submission to the mayor and city council, and may grant a variance if the mayor and city council find that: 
                  a.  The reasons set forth in the application, and the recommendations of the zoning enforcement officer, justify the granting of a variance that would enable the reasonable use of the land, buildings, or other improvements, and 
                  b.  The variance granted is the minimum variance reasonably possible, and 
                  c.  The granting of the variance would be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of these regulations, and will not be injurious to the surrounding territory or detrimental to the public health, welfare, and safety. 
                  The mayor and city council, at the time of granting the variance, may prescribe reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with these regulations, which will become a part of the variance. 
                  Under no circumstances shall the zoning review board grant a variance to allow a use in the district involved which is expressly, or by implication, prohibited by the terms of this ordinance. 
                  8.  If granted, the applicant must exercise the variance within a period of one calendar year from the date of decision by the zoning review board. After one year's elapsed time, the variance is void, and of no further force and effect. 
                  9.  If the final action by the zoning review board denies the variance application, the zoning review board will provide in writing to the applicant a reasonable explanation of the reason(s) for denial of the application. A copy of such explanation will become part of the minutes of the meeting at which such application denial was decided by the zoning review board. 
                  ARTICLE V - PROCEDURE FOR APPLYING FOR A SPECIAL EXCEPTION 
                  1.  Applicant will submit to the zoning enforcement officer the completed "special exception request application," and must pay the required administrative fee to the city clerk before the application will be considered.

                  b.  The location, nature, duration, and extent of the proposed land use; and 
                  c.  The existing land use, or uses, on the respective property and all adjoining properties. 
                  2.  The zoning enforcement officer will review the application for completeness, and compliance with the rules and regulations of the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations. 
                  3.  The zoning enforcement officer and the chairman of the planning and zoning commission will schedule a public hearing to consider the proposed special exception. 
                  4.  At the direction of the chairman of the planning and zoning commission, the zoning enforcement officer will, at least 15 days prior to the public hearing, notify the public by: 
                  a.  Posting a notice containing the time, place, and proposed action to be considered at the public hearing, in city hall; and 
                  b.  Publishing a similar notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Byron; and

                  a.  Reapply for the same change of zoning after not less than six months; or

                  APPENDIX II - THE PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION[4] 
                  Qualifications of Members; Terms of Office 
                  There is hereby established a planning and zoning commission which shall consist of five members appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council. All members shall be both residents and freeholders of the City of Byron. All members shall serve without pay. 
                  The members of such commission shall in the first instance be appointed so that three of the appointed members of said planning and zoning commission shall be appointed for a term of two years and two members for a term of one year. Thereafter, all appointed members shall be appointed for a term of two years from and after their respective first appointments. 
                  Members shall be appointed from among persons in a position to represent the public interest, and no person shall be appointed with private or personal interests likely to conflict with the general public interest. If any person appointed shall find that his or her private or personal interests are involved in any matter coming before the planning and zoning commission, he or she shall disqualify themselves from taking part in any action on the matter by the commission. 
                  Removal of Members and Filling Vacancies 
                  Members of the planning and zoning commission may be removed for cause by a majority vote of the city council. Vacancies in the planning and zoning commission shall be filled by persons appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council for the unexpired term only. 
                  Officers and Rules 
                  The commission shall annually select a chairman and vice-chairman from among its members. The zoning enforcement official for the city shall serve as secretary to this commission. The secretary shall not be entitled to a vote. 
                  The commission shall adopt rules for the governance of its proceedings and shall keep a record of attendance of its members at meetings, records of resolutions, transactions, findings, and determinations showing the vote of each member on each question or matter requiring a vote, or if absent or abstaining from voting on said question or matter. The records of the commission shall be a public record, and shall be retained in the office of the city clerk. 
                  The commission shall hold at least one regular meeting every month, on a day established by the commission, and may hold such additional regular or special meetings as may be designated by the commission. The chairman or the vice-chairman, in the chairman's absence, may call a special meeting upon request of the zoning enforcement officer when the chairman or vice-chairman determines, in his discretion, that such a meeting is necessary and proper. A special meeting shall not be called if the application of the proposed zoning action is not verified by the zoning enforcement officer as complete. The chairman shall call a special meeting of the commission when so requested by the mayor and council for consideration of amendments to the text or map of this zoning ordinance. Notice of regular and special meetings shall be posted for public information in the city hall. 
                  The commission shall not transact any business at any regular or special meeting until and unless a quorum of three members is present, and every action taken and every decision rendered by the commission shall be approved by at least three members. 
                  Should any commission member be absent from more than three consecutive regular commission meetings, or more than six total regular or special meetings annually, the mayor shall remove said member and appoint a new individual for the unexpired term only. 
                  Members of the commission shall receive no salaries or fees for their services on the commission.

                  PART IV - ZONING REGULATION 
                  ARTICLE I -   

                  Section I - Zoning ordinance: general provisions. 
                  Land and Building Uses—General Provision 
                  It is intended that all buildings hereafter erected, reconstructed, altered, enlarged, moved, or maintained, as well as any existing building, and the underlying land, shall be used only for the purpose permitted in the zone in which such building or land is located, and then only after applying for and securing all permits and licenses required. If for any reason any use is omitted from the list of those specified as permissible in each of the various districts designated in this ordinance, or if ambiguity arises concerning the appropriate classification of a particular use within the meaning and intent of this ordinance, a person may file a request for inclusion of a particular use within a particular district, or for an interpretation, if any ambiguity arises with the zoning enforcement officer. It shall be the duty of the planning and zoning commission to ascertain all pertinent facts concerning such use(s), and by officially recorded resolution set forth its findings and reasons for designating a specific classification for such use(s). Such resolution of findings and reasons shall be referred to the city council, and if approved by the city council, such designated classifications shall thereafter govern. 
                  Suitability of Buildings 
                  Any proposed building shall be considered as to its suitability of design and type of construction in relation to the district and to the immediate neighborhood site, and if such design or construction is so markedly incongruous with the character of that neighborhood as to be detrimental to the value of adjacent or nearby properties, then the zoning enforcement official shall refuse the application. 
                  Grading of Building Site 
                  No lot owner shall grade his lot in such a manner as to interfere with the natural drainage of adjoining lots, or to divert the drainage of his lot onto adjoining lots, not [nor] to interfere with the natural drainage of any lot so that the drainage of such lot is diverted upon any public street or thoroughfare in such a manner, or in such amounts, as to flood a public street(s) or thoroughfare(s). 
                  Every lot which is used for a building site shall be so graded that it will be dry and free from standing water, and the grade around the walls of every new building, at the point where the sill meets these walls, shall slope away from such walls into adequate means of drainage as may be approved by the city engineer at the request of the zoning enforcement officer. 
                  Large Buildings 
                  Commercial structures proposed to be constructed within the City of Byron which exceed 15,000 square feet in gross floor area, even though they meet all other requirements set forth in this ordinance, or any other ordinance, must receive separate approval of the city council after the proposed plans have been reviewed by, and recommendations received from, the planning and zoning commission, and the zoning enforcement official (either separately or in a joint communication). The planning and zoning commission, and the zoning enforcement official, shall review the proposed plans to insure that adequate provisions are made for traffic circulation, fire protection, sewage disposal, and, in general, the health and safety of the city's residents. The planning and zoning commission, and/or the zoning enforcement official, may recommend to the city council to impose certain restrictions or conditions prior to its approval and the granting of a building permit. 
                  Parking of Commercial Vehicles 
                  The regular or constant parking of commercial vehicles, which description shall include trucks and other vehicles, having a rated capacity of three-quarters ton or more, truck tractors having an overall length of more than 12 feet, or the storing, keeping, or maintenance of any machinery, equipment, building materials, or other material(s) is permitted only within specified districts. 
                  Mobile Homes 
                  No mobile home, as defined in this ordinance, shall be parked within a residential district, except where expressly permitted in the regulations for the residential type zoning districts. 
                  Boats, Travel Trailers, and Recreational Vehicles 
                  Boats, travel trailers, and recreational vehicles may be parked or stored entirely within a carport, garage, or other enclosed structure within a residential district. Where a partially or entirely enclosed storage structure does not exist on the residential lot, the vehicle may be parked on the rearmost portion of the lot away from streetside frontage. Boats, travel trailers, and recreational vehicles shall not be parked in a private driveway, or in the front or side yards of a residential lot for more than a period of 30 consecutive days. Under no circumstances shall any boat, travel trailer, or recreational vehicle be slept in or otherwise used for lodging or habitation purpose while parked or stored within a residential district. 
                  Corner Lots, Through Lots, Lots of Unusual Shapes: Residential Setbacks 
                  "Front of Lot" 
                  For corner lots, the side having the least street frontage shall be considered the "front" for setback purposes. 
                  Corner Lot (Other Than Reverse) 
                  In the case of corner lots which do not have reversed frontage, the side yard toward the street shall be 15 feet or greater in depth. Accessory buildings and pools located in the rear yard of such a corner lot shall be set back 15 feet or more from the street right-of-way line. 
                  Reverse Corner Lots 
                  When the rear lot line of a corner lot is common with the sideline of an adjoining interior lot, the minimum rear setback for the corner lot shall be 20 feet, or a distance at least equal to the depth of the front yard setback of the abutting interior lot (measured from the street right-of-way line along the common property line). Accessory buildings and pools located in the required rear setback area of a reverse corner lot shall be set back from the street right-of-way a distance equal to the front yard depth of the adjoining interior lot. The minimum side yard setback shall be 15 feet on the remaining street side of a reverse corner lot. 
                  Through Lots 
                  In the case of "through lots," setbacks on all street frontages shall be at least the distance required for front yard setbacks in the particular residential district in which it is located. Where one of the front yards that would normally be required on a through lot is not in keeping with the prevailing yard pattern, the zoning enforcement official may waive the requirement for the normal front yard setback, and substitute a special yard requirement which shall not exceed the average of the yards provided on adjacent lots. 
                  Lots of Unusual Shape 
                  For corner lots of unusual shape, not forming part of a general rectangular lot pattern, the zoning enforcement official shall prescribe front and side yard setbacks on a case-by-case basis, subject to the following limitations: 
                  1.  No front yard shall be required to have a greater depth than is required generally within the district. 
                  2.  No side yard shall be required to have a greater width than the depth required generally for front yards within the same district; except the zoning enforcement officer may reduce side yards by one-half foot for each additional foot of front yard setback, but in no case shall the reduction be less than one-half of the required side yards for existing nonconforming lots of record. 
                  Accessory Buildings in Residential Zones 
                  No detached accessory use or structure shall be permitted in the required front yard, or the required side yards of the front half of the lot depth. On double-frontage lots (i.e., through lots), or corner lots, no detached accessory structures shall be permitted in the required yards fronting on streets. 
                  When an accessory building is attached to a principal structure by a breezeway, roofed passage, or otherwise connected to the principal structure, the accessory structure shall comply with the dimensional requirements of the principal building. 
                  Accessory structures for the housing of persons, such as guesthouses and garage apartments, shall not be located in any of the required yard areas of the principal residence. Other accessory structures shall not be built closer than five feet from any rear or side property line in the rear half of the lot depth. 
                  No separate accessory building or structure shall be located within five feet of any other accessory building or structure. 
                  The elevation of the highest point of any accessory building shall not exceed the elevation of the highest point of the main building. 
                  The combined total ground area covered by the primary residential structure and all accessory buildings on a given lot shall not exceed 35 percent of the lot area in R-1 districts, 40 percent in R-2 districts, 55 percent of the lot area in R-3 districts. These percentages shall apply to townhouses. 
                  No guesthouse or garage apartment shall be constructed upon a lot for occupancy before the completion of the main building(s). This shall not prohibit the erection of other accessory buildings prior to the construction of the principal building, when the accessory buildings are neither constructed nor used for dwelling purposes. 
                  Walls and Fences 
                  Requests for permits for the construction of walls, or erection of fences, must be accompanied by a site plan and drawings clearly showing the locations and heights for which approval is requested. 
                  Height 
                  In front yards, and in side yards with street frontage, walls and fences shall not exceed three feet in height above the street curb elevation or underlying ground level, whichever is lower. In the rear yard of a corner lot, fences in excess of three feet in height shall be set back from the street right-of-way the same distance as is prescribed for accessory buildings in the rear yard of corner lots, five feet. In all other side and rear yard areas, walls and fences may be a maximum of six feet in height above the ground level. Where compliance with these height limits would cause a hardship due to the natural topography of a particular lot, the zoning enforcement officer may permit portions of a fence or wall to be up to eight feet in height in areas where the normal maximum height would be six feet. 
                  However, no wall or fence of any type (natural or manmade) shall be permitted which would in any way obstruct the visibility of automobiles at intersections and points of entry and exit to the public right-of-way. 
                  Materials Permitted In Residential Districts 
                  In any single-family residential district, fences in the front yard or in a side yard with street frontage shall be generally decorative in design and materials utilized. Chicken wire, barbed wire, electrically charged fences, or similar type fences shall not be erected in any residential district. Neither shall any wall, fence, or similar structure erected in any residential district contain any material(s) or substance(s) such as broken glass, spikes, nails, barbs, or any similar materials designed to inflict pain or injury upon any person or animal. 
                  Designs and Materials Permitted in Nonresidential Districts 
                  In any nonresidential district, barbed wire may be incorporated in or used as a fence above the level of six feet from ground level. Any utilization of barbed wire shall be placed so that it does not project outward over any street, sidewalk, public way, or adjacent property. Fences and walls within office (O-1), commercial (C-1 thru C-4), or industrial (I-1 and I-2) shall be designed and constructed so that adequate access to buildings is maintained for firefighting purposes. 
                  Violations Affecting Public Safety 
                  Should any person violate the part of this ordinance which prohibits hedges or plantings from obstructing visibility at intersections, and points of entry and exit to the public right-of-way (hedges and plantings in excess of 2½ feet in height), then the city may, after serving written notice upon the property owner responsible for such violation and a subsequent period of ten calendar days have elapsed, enter upon the property, where such violation is taking place, and cut and trim the hedges or plantings causing such violation to a height to conform with the provisions of this ordinance; and upon performing such labor, shall bill said property owner for the actual cost of such labor; it being determined by the city council that such hedges or plantings are in violation of this ordinance, and constitute a direct danger to vehicular traffic on streets of the city, and it being within the police power of the city to abate such danger or hazard to the public's safety. 
                  Swimming Pool—Location, Walls and Fences 
                  1.  All swimming pools, whether above or in ground, shall be completely enclosed by a fence or wall. Swimming pool fences and walls shall be subject to this subsection and shall not be subject to paragraph one of the subsection under walls and fences entitled "Height." The following requirements for swimming pool fences shall be as follows: 
                  a.  Fences or walls around all swimming pools shall be not less than five feet nor more than six feet in height and have at least one access gate. All access gates shall open outwards away from the pool and shall be self-closing and have a self-latching device. 
                  b.  Fences or rails constructed along the deck of an aboveground pool will not qualify as meeting the requirements of this subsection. A separate fence or wall meeting the requirements of this subsection will be required. 
                  c.  Openings in fences shall not allow passage of a four-inch diameter sphere. 
                  d.  A swimming pool enclosed within a screened structure shall not qualify as meeting the requirements of this subsection. A separate fence or wall meeting the requirements of this subsection will be required. 
                  2.  Swimming pools shall be located a minimum of ten feet from all property lines. 
                  Building(s) to Have Access 
                  Every building hereafter erected or moved shall be on a lot adjacent to a public street, and all structures shall be so located on lots as to provide safe and convenient access for servicing, fire protection, other emergency vehicles, and required off-street parking. 
                  Solid Waste Containers 
                  Prior to the issuance of a building permit, plans for the construction of any and all commercial, office, or industrial buildings, and multiple-family residential complexes containing a total of more than ten residential units, must show the location of container(s) for solid waste disposal. The number of containers, their location, and access to them for unloading purposes, are subject to the approval of the director of public works. 
                  Relocation or Moving a Building 
                  Any building moved into or relocated to a new site within the city shall comply with all applicable City of Byron ordinances. 
                  (Ord. No. 2001-15, § 1, 11-12-2001; Ord. No. 2003-8, § 1, 8-11-2003)

                  The mayor and city council of Byron have divided the City of Byron into the following zoning districts: 

                   
                  These districts are shown on the official map for the City of Byron. This map is open for public inspection in the city clerk's office. 
                  In addition to the above listed zoning districts, the City of Byron has approved a residential planned unit development district zoning category which will permit residential planned unit development districts. Whenever such a district is approved, it will be shown on the official map for the City of Byron.

                  Section 2 - Determining district boundaries. 
                  The following rules shall apply when determining the exact boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the official map: 
                  1.  Boundaries shown as following the centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys shall follow such centerlines; 
                  2.  Boundaries shown as following platted lot lines shall follow such lines; 
                  3.  Boundaries shown as following the city limits shall follow such limits; 
                  4.  Boundaries shown as following railroad lines shall be midway between the main track lines; 
                  5.  Boundaries shown as following the banks of streams shall follow the centerlines of such streams, and in the event of a course change of such stream the centerline shall be construed as moving with the actual stream. 
                  6.  Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map; 
                  7.  Where physical features are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or not covered by subsections 1 through 6 above, the zoning review board shall interpret the district boundaries; 
                  8.  When any street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applying to each lot and/or parcel of abutting property shall apply to that portion of such street or alley added to the property. 
                  Section 3 - Application of district regulations. 
                  The regulations established by this ordinance within each district apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land.

                  No building or structure shall hereafter be erected, moved or altered which does not comply with the following height requirements: 
                  1.  Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the construction of objects which, because of their height, illumination or reflectivity, electrical emissions, and/or air emissions, represent an obstruction or safety hazard to air traffic operating in and out of Robins Air Force Base. 
                  2.  Definitions. The following definitions shall be used to interpret the requirements of this section: 
                  a.  Conical surface. This inclined surface extends outward and upward from the outer periphery of the inner horizontal surface for a horizontal distance of 7,000 feet. The slope of the conical surface is 20:1 (one foot change in elevation for each 20 feet in distance from the starting point), with an inner elevation of 150 feet above the established airfield elevation and an outer elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. 
                  b.  Established airfield elevation. The altitude, measured in feet above mean sea level (MSL), of the Robins Air Force Base main runway surface. This elevation is hereby declared to be 295 feet MSL. 
                  c.  Height. The true highest altitude of a structure or natural feature (including trees, protruding rocks, or natural ground surface) as measured in feet above mean sea level. 
                  d.  Inner horizontal surface. This surface is a plane, oval in shape, that extends 7,500 feet from the RAFB airfield runway centerline at a height of 150 feet above the established airfield elevation. 
                  e.  Obstruction. Any structure or natural feature (including trees, protruding rocks, or natural ground surface) which exceeds the height limitation defined by the outer horizontal surface established for Robins Air Force Base. 
                  f.  Outer horizontal surface. This surface is a horizontal plane that begins at the outer edge of the conical surface and extends for 30,000 feet at a height of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. 
                  g.  Structure. Any stationary or mobile object constructed or installed by man, including without limitation, buildings, towers, cranes, smokestacks, earth formations, and overhead transmission lines. 
                  3.  Application. These regulations shall apply to all lands within the City of Byron that are overlaid by the outer horizontal surface established for Robins Air Force Base. These boundaries of these surfaces are shown on the City of Byron, Robins Air Force Base Environs, Protected Height Surfaces Map which by this reference is incorporated herein and which Map is kept on file in the office of the Zoning Enforcement Officer. All development activity within these areas shall comply with the performance standards in subsection 4 of this section in addition to the requirements of the underlying zoning district. Where conflicting standards and requirements exist, the more stringent standards and requirements shall apply. 
                  4.  Performance standards. All development within the areas governed by these height requirements shall comply with the following performance standards: 
                  a.  Height limitation. No structure shall be built which, by virtue of its finished height, would constitute an obstruction within the meaning of these regulations. Where the development or redevelopment of land within the areas affected by these regulations will involve substantial grading and/or site preparation, the zoning enforcement officer may require the applicant to remove any existing obstructions (either natural or manmade) on the site as a condition of development plan approval. 
                  b.  Use restrictions. No use may be made of land or water located within the RAFB approach-departure surfaces that would: 
                  Create or result in electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between Robins Air Force Base and aircraft operating within the affected areas; 
                  Produce or reflect light in a sufficient intensity or manner that would make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other light sources, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the base airport, or otherwise impair visibility in the vicinity of the base. All proposed light sources that could conflict with this requirement (except structure lighting required under FAR part 77) shall be properly shielded or directed away from a pilot's field of vision; 
                  Emit smoke or particulate matter which, in sufficient quantities or concentrations, would impair pilot visibility in the vicinity of the base or clog aircraft engines; or 
                  Attract large flocks of birds, which would constitute a hazard to air navigation in the vicinity of the base. No solid waste disposal facility or landfill may be sited within the areas affected by these regulations. 
                  5.  Review procedures. The standard zoning compliance process for the City of Byron shall apply to the areas affected by these regulations. However, any applicant proposing to construct a structure that is located within the Robins Air Force Base outer horizontal surface and that would exceed 200 feet in height as measured from its tallest point to the finished ground level shall comply with the following review procedures, in addition to the normal zoning compliance process. 
                  a.  FAA Review. The applicant shall submit a copy of the application for FAA review under FAR Part 77, if applicable. A copy of the FAR Part 77 review transmittal letter and application shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission to document compliance with this requirement. The planning and zoning commission may condition any approval upon FAA approval under FAR Part 77 review. 
                  b.  Robins Air Force Base Civil Engineers Office Review. The City of Byron shall provide a copy of an application for building and zoning compliance within the affected areas, including the development plan and a copy of the FAR Part 77 review transmittal letter and application as required, to the staff of the Middle Georgia Regional Development Center (MGRDC), within five business days of submittal by applicant. The staff of the MGRDC will forward such information to the Robins Air Force Base Civil Engineers Office and any other affected parties for review. The MGRDC will review all comments and provide written recommendations to the zoning enforcement officer and to the planning and zoning commission within ten business days of receipt. The planning and zoning commission may condition any approval upon Robins Air Force Base recommendations. 
                  6.  Submission requirements. An applicant shall submit a preliminary plan in accordance with the applicable requirements of these regulations for any development application that satisfies the special review requirements in subsection 5 of this section. The zoning enforcement officer may require the applicant to submit any or all of the items specified below, if the additional information is necessary to ensure compliance with the performance standards in subsection 4 of this section. 
                  a.  Imaginary surface boundaries. The applicant may be required to delineate on the preliminary plan the boundaries of any primary surface, clear zone surface, approach-departure clearance surfaces, inner horizontal surface, or transitional surfaces, if the location of the aforementioned surface boundaries with respect to the proposed development site or proposed structure locations is in question. All maps prepared to show the location of these boundaries shall be drawn to a scale designated by the zoning enforcement officer. 
                  b.  Location of structures. The applicant may be required to delineate the placement of all existing and proposed buildings and structures, including any existing or proposed tree stands. 
                  c.  Specification of uses. The applicant may be required to specify the proposed uses to occur within each structure or activity area on the development site. 
                  d.  Surface elevation benchmarks. The applicant may be required to show the surface elevation of all structures (above mean sea level) and the maximum height in feet of any structure. For residential subdivisions, the zoning enforcement officer may require the applicant to show surface elevations for the property in five-foot contours with sufficient benchmarks to verify contour elevations. 
                  e.  Narrative description. The applicant may be required to prepare a narrative describing the location of the site, its total acreage, existing character and use; the concept of the proposed development or use, such as proposed residential density; and the relation of the proposed development plan to the comprehensive plan. 
                  7.  Variances. Any applicant wishing to erect a new structure, increase the height of an existing structure, permit the growth of any tree, or commit the property to a use that is not in compliance with the regulations prescribed in these regulations may apply to the zoning review board for a variance. The application for variance must be submitted in the form and manner specified in these regulations, and it must be accompanied by a written determination from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Robins Air Force Base Civil Engineer's Office stating that the proposed structure will not be located within a normal aircraft flight track, that the requested height variance will not be excessive, and that all appropriate measures will be taken by the applicant to prevent any negative impacts on safe navigation within the protected airspace surrounding Robins Air Force Base. Such variances shall be issued only where it is duly determined that a literal application or enforcement of these regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and the relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit and intent of these regulations. In addition, the zoning review board may solicit the testimony of a qualified professional, at the expense of the applicant, to evaluate the proposed development plans and issue any professional findings or opinions that would assist the board in reaching a decision regarding the variance request. The selection of a qualified professional shall be done by the zoning review board.

                  Section 5 - Nonconforming use. 
                  Intent 
                  Within the districts established by this ordinance, or amendments that may later be adopted, there exists: 
                  a.  Lots, 
                  b.  Structures, 
                  c.  Uses of land and structures, and 
                  d.  Characteristics of use, 
                  which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this ordinance, or future amendment(s). It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
                  Nonconforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination, shall not be extended or enlarged upon in any manner after passage of this ordinance. 
                  To avoid hardship, this ordinance shall not require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption, or amendment of, this ordinance. 
                  Nonconforming Lots of Record 
                  Any residential lot of record may be used to construct thereon any structure in compliance with the zone in which said lot is located. Such lots shall have a minimum width at the street of 30 feet and must be on city sewerage or have a minimum area of 10,000 square feet if on septic tank and meet all setback, side yard, and lot coverage limitations and off-street parking requirements for the district in which it is located. 
                  Nonconforming Use of Land (or Land with Minor Structures Only) 
                  Where at the time of adoption of this ordinance, lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Ordinance, the use may be continued [so long] as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
                  a.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended, to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. 
                  b.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the date of adoption of this ordinance. 
                  c.  No such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 30 days (except when governmental action(s) impede(s) access to the premises); any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the district in which the specified land is located. 
                  d.  No additional structure that does not conform to the requirements of this ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
                  Nonconforming Structures 
                  Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
                  a.  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in any way, but any structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity; 
                  b.  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance; 
                  c.  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
                  Nonconforming Uses of Structures or of Structures and Premises in Combination 
                  If lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful and subject to the following provisions: 
                  a.  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located; 
                  b.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building; 
                  c.  If a use is superseded by a permitted use, for the district, the nonconforming use may not then be resumed; 
                  d.  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, the removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of that land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction; 
                  e.  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18 months during any three-year period (except when government action(s) impede(s) access to the premises), in [the] structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
                  Repairs and Maintenance 
                  On any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or repair and/or replacement of nonloadbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming portion of the structure, as the case may be, provided that the cubic area content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
                  If a nonconforming structure, or portion of a structure, containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.

No permit shall be issued for the construction of any building or structure including railroads, streets, bridges, and utility lines or for any use within the flood hazard district until the plans for such construction or use have been submitted to the zoning review board and approval is given in writing for such construction or use. In its review of plans submitted, the zoning review board shall be guided by the following standards, keeping in mind that the purpose of this district is to prevent encroachment into the floodway which will unduly increase flood heights and endanger life and property. 
                  1.  Any structure or the filling of land permitted shall be of a type not appreciably damaged by floodwaters, provided no structures for human habitation shall be permitted.

                  6.  Where in the opinion of the said board topographic data, engineering, and other studies are needed to determine the effects of flooding on a proposed structure or fill and/or the effect of the structure or fill on the flow of water, the said board may require the applicant to submit such data or other studies prepared by competent engineers and other technical people. 
                  7.  The granting of approval of any structure or use shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind or nature by the governing body or the board of zoning appeals or by any officer or employee thereof, or the practicality or safety of any structure or use proposed and shall create no liability upon or cause action against such public body, officer, or employee for any damage that may result pursuant thereto. 
                  3.  [E] Warning of [and] disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as bridge openings restricted by debris. These regulations do not imply that areas outside the flood district boundaries or land uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the government or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

                  [Section] 2. - Establishment of water resource overlay districts. 
                  The City of Byron's water resource overlay districts shall include the following: 
                  Groundwater Recharge Area Overlay District 
                  Wetlands Protection Overlay District 
                  The boundaries of these water resource overlay districts are shown on a set of maps designated as "Water Resource Overlay Districts" and are included as part of the City of Byron's official zoning map, which is on file in the zoning enforcement officer's office located in the Municipal Complex, Moseley Road, Byron, Georgia. 
                  [Section] 3. - Definitions. 
                  In addition to the general definitions provided in this ordinance, the following definitions shall apply to this section [article]: 
                  A.  Aquifer. Any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  B.  Drastic. The standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Document EPA-600-87-035 (Note: The drastic methodology is most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility). 
                  C.  Generalized wetlands map. The current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for the City of Byron, Georgia. 
                  D.  Jurisdictional wetland. An area that needs the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  E.  Jurisdictional wetland determination. A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended. 
                  F.  Pollution susceptibility. The relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  G.  Pollution susceptibility map. The relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources using the drastic methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.) 
                  H.  Recharge area. Any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  I.  Regulated activity. Any activity which will or which may reasonably be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  J.  Significant recharge areas. Those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). 
                  K.  Water resource districts. A water resource district is a map overlay which imposes a set of requirements in addition to those of the underlying zoning district. 
                  L.  Wetlands. Those areas inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation and hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
                  [Section] 4. - Groundwater recharge area overlay district. 
                  4.1.  Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides, sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  4.2.  Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. 
                  4.3.  District delineation. The groundwater recharge area overlay district is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition)." Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the "Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 edition." Said maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance. 
                  4.4.  Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the groundwater recharge area protection overlay district. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
                  (A)  New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  (B)  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within: 
                  (1)  A high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  (2)  A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet in size; and 
                  (3)  A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in size. 
                  As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 × 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the national resource and conservation service. 
                  (C)  New homes served by septic tank/drainfield systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on table MT1 of the department of human resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter "DHR table MT-1"). The minimum set forth in table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A—F) of the DHR manual. The minimum lot size specified by this section shall not be less than the minimum lot size specified in part IV, art. III of the ordinance [this appendix A]. 
                  (1)  One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  (2)  One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
                  (3)  One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  (D)  New manufactured home parks served by septic tank/drainfield systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on table MT-2 of the department of human resources' (DHR) Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter "DHR table MT-2"). The minimums set forth in table MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A—F) of the DHR manual. 
                  (1)  One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area;

                  Notes to tables 

                   
                  [Section] 5. - Wetlands protection overlay district. 
                  5.1.  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the City of Byron are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study; and recreational opportunities. 
                  5.2.  Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas. 
                  5.3.  District delineation. The wetlands protection overlay district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Byron, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the "generalized wetlands map" and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto. 
                  The generalized wetlands map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City of Byron and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  5.4.  Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use except those identified in section 5.5 shall be allowed within the wetlands protection district without a development permit from the City of Byron. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued. 
                  5.5.  Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the wetland protection overlay district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging as provided herein. (These activities listed in this section are exempted from section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.)

                  (Ord. No. 2001-17, 12-10-2001) 
                  APPENDIX Z-1 - REGULATIONS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING AND OFF-STREET LOADING 
                  The off-street parking, loading, and unloading requirements shall apply to all new structures or buildings, or any existing buildings that may be substantially altered after the date of adoption of this ordinance. 
                  1.  Change in intensity of use. Whenever a building or structure erected prior to or after the date of adoption of this ordinance undergoes any increase in number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, number of employees, or other unit of measure specified in this ordinance for required parking or loading facilities, and when such increase would result in a requirement for additional parking or loading facilities as specified in this ordinance, such additional facilities shall be provided accordingly; except, that no building or structure erected prior to the date of adoption of this ordinance shall be required to provide parking or loading facilities unless the additional facilities amount to an increase of 25 percent, in which case, parking or loading spaces shall be provided on the basis of the additional units of measurement (as mentioned in this subsection) of the new use of the altered or expanded existing use. 
                  When a building or structure shall undergo any decrease in the number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of measurement specified in this ordinance for required parking or loading facilities, and when it would result in a requirement for fewer total parking or loading spaces as specified in this ordinance, parking or loading facilities may be reduced accordingly, provided that the remaining parking and loading facilities shall at least equal or exceed the parking or loading requirements of this ordinance as applied to the modified building or structure. 
                  2.  Minimum distance and setbacks. Parking spaces shall not be located within the area prescribed for front yard setbacks. The zoning enforcement officer may waive this requirement, on a case-by-case basis, if the property owner, or his representative, presents a site plan showing a landscaped strip, a minimum of five feet in width, along the front property line when applying for a permit for the construction of the building and/or parking lot, and then installs the planted landscaped strip as illustrated on the site plan. The zoning enforcement officer shall withhold final inspection approval of all the improvements on the property until the landscaping is installed and complete. Such landscaping shall be continually maintained by a property owner. Any wall or fence erected in place of a landscaping strip shall observe the minimum setbacks for that zoning district. 
                  3.  Design of parking lots. A parking lot for five or more vehicles must meet the following criteria prior to issuance of a permit for the construction of the lot: 
                  a.  A minimum of ten percent of the parking lot area shall be landscaped; a landscaped strip, a minimum of five feet wide, must be provided on each side which is adjacent to streets. All lots shall also be effectively screened by landscaping on each side which adjoins or fronts property situated in any residential district. Such landscaped strip shall be dense enough to shield the cars. The landscaping shall be maintained in good condition by the property owner. Required setback areas shall not be paved except for those areas specifically necessary for entrance and exitways. The zoning review board may waive or reduce the landscaping requirements in cases of extreme hardship. In lieu of the landscaping requirement, a fence or wall must be provided, which must be approved by the zoning review board. 
                  b.  No application for a building permit for a new, enlarged, or altered, structure, or improvement of use, shall be approved unless accompanied by a plot plan drawn to scale, showing the required off-street automobile parking facilities and improvements as specified in this section nor shall a permit be issued for the improvement of a parking area to serve as an accessory use to an existing building or buildings until a plot plan drawn to scale has been submitted in accordance with this section. Prior to approval, the plot plan will be reviewed and approved by a certified civil engineer for sufficient drainage, as well as entry and exit points, and by the zoning enforcement officer for landscaping and to insure compliance with all the requirements of this ordinance, including the adequacy of the parking lot to accomplish its purpose. 
                  c.  Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking lot shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining properties. The parking lot must be graveled or paved with asphalt, concrete, brick, or other hard surface material approved by the city's agent or zoning enforcement officer. 
                  d.  Landscaping, including trees, shall be required within the interior of parking lots (in addition to the perimeter landscaping) when the parking lot area exceeds 20,000 square feet. Periodic maintenance shall be required. 
                  e.  Landscaping shall not obstruct the visibility of automobiles at intersections, or entry and exit points. 
                  f.  All parking lots shall have appropriate entrance and exit signs. No advertising signs for uses conducted on the premises shall be permitted on or in conjunction with these entrance and exit signs. 
                  4.  Certificate of occupancy or use permits. No certificate of occupancy or use permit will be issued upon completion of any building, or addition, which would require an increase in parking space or off-street loading and unloading space, unless and until all off-street parking and load space requirements, as shown on the approved plans, or which are made a part of the building permit, shall be completed and determined by the zoning enforcement official to be ready for use. 
                  5.  Loading space. As required in this ordinance, the space supplied for such off-street loading and unloading purposes shall not be construed as supplying required off-street parking space. 
                  6.  Location of parking space. Parking spaces provided pursuant to this section must be graveled or hard surfaced, and properly drained. The spaces shall be located on the same property as the principal building, or on a properly zoned lot within 300 feet of the building. Such distance measured from the nearest point of the parking lot to the nearest boundary of the property on which the building is located that said parking lot is required to serve. In determining automobile parking spaces, if not shown by actual site plan and count, 300 sq. ft. of gross area per parking space will be utilized in computing the number of spaces necessary. 
                  7.  Joint, use of off-street parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent the joint use of off-street parking or off-street loading space for two or more buildings or uses if the total of such spaces, when used together, is not less than the sum of the requirements for the various individual uses computed separately in accordance with this section. 
                  8.  Use of required off-street parking by another building. No part of an off-street parking lot required for any building or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this ordinance shall be included as a part of an off-street parking area similarly required for another building or use, unless the type of structure indicates that the periods of usage of such structures will not be simultaneous, or, unless the size of said off-street parking lot is sufficient to comply with the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  9.  Remote parking lots—incumbered. Where the provisions of off-street parking for a building or other use established after the adoption of this ordinance involves one or more parcels, or tracts, or lots of land that are not a part of the plot on which the principal use is situated, the applicant for a permit for the principal use shall include these tracts or lots of land as meeting their parking requirements of the principal use. 
                  When a principal use has specified a remote parking lot in accordance with these regulations outlined herein to provide the required minimum parking spaces, the occupational license for the principal use will not be renewed by the city until the owner, and/or operator, of the principal use presents sufficient evidence to the city that the required parking spaces will be provided for the same period as the license. 
                  The applicant shall deposit the necessary recording fee, and upon the issuance of a building permit, the zoning enforcement official shall cause said legal instrument of incumbrance to be recorded in the office of the city clerk. 
                  10.  Accessory parking in residential areas. A lot, or lots, separated by a common boundary from an office or commercial district, but located in an R-2 or R-3 district, may be used as a free parking lot, or lots, to service the contiguous and adjoining commercial use, or uses, or as otherwise permitted by this ordinance, provided that: 
                  a.  No advertising signs of any type are erected in the area; 
                  b.  The setback from the front property line shall be the same as for the district in which the lot, or lots, are located; 
                  c.  All automobile parking lots shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins or fronts property situated in any residential or multiple-family dwelling district by a wall, fence, or densely planted hedge. Such wall, fence, or hedge shall be not less than four feet in height, and shall be maintained in good condition; 
                  d.  No structure shall be erected in such area. 
                  11.  Waiving of paving requirements. Where light or infrequent use of the parking lot may make it desirable to waive the paving requirement, the city council may, upon appeal of the lot owner, waive this requirement. 
                  Should the use of this lot change appreciably such that an unpaved lot is no longer adequate, the city council may require the lot to conform with the requirements in this section. 
                  12.  Off-street loading and unloading regulations. On the same premises with every building, structure, or part thereof, erected and occupied for the uses of manufacturing, warehouse storage, food processing or wholesale distribution plant, department store, wholesale store, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary, laundry, dry cleaning, or other uses similarly involving the receipt or distribution by vehicles, of materials or merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained on the lot adequate space for the standing, loading, and unloading services, in order to avoid undue interference with public use of the streets or alleys. Such space, unless adequately provided elsewhere on the lot, shall include a minimum of 12 by 55 feet load space, with a 14-foot minimum height clearance, for every 20,000 square feet or fraction thereof in excess of 3,000 sq. ft. of building space used for the above-mentioned purposes, or for 20,000 sq. ft., or fraction thereof, in excess of 3,000 sq. ft. of land used for the above-mentioned purposes, 
                  APPENDIX Z-II - REGULATIONS FOR SIGNS AND ADVERTISING 
                  The provisions of this section govern the location, size, setback, and height of signs in each of the zoning districts established in these regulations so as to insure safe construction, light, air, and open space; to reduce hazards at intersections; to prevent the accumulation of trash; and to protect property values of the entire community. The building code adopted by the governing body is also a part of these regulations. 
                  1.  General provisions. 
                  a.  All outdoor advertising signs shall require a permit and will be permitted in only certain zoning districts.

                  i.  Any established outdoor advertising signs which are nonconforming at the date of adoption of this ordinance shall either be altered to conform with these regulations or shall cease to be displayed after a period of three years from the date of adoption of this ordinance. 
                  2.  Signs other than outdoor advertising signs as permitted uses. Signs for the purpose of conveying information, knowledge, or ideas to the public about a subject directly relating to the premises on which it is located shall be permitted in the following zoning districts provided the specified requirements are adhered to: 
                  a.  A-1, R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-MH residential districts.

                  PART V - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 
                  ARTICLE I -   

                  Section 1 - General principles of design. 
                  Suitability of Land 
                  Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, and erosion, as determined by the city's engineer and land determined by the planning commission to be unsuitable for development shall not be platted for any uses as may continue such conditions or increase the danger to health, safety, life, or property unless steps are taken to eliminate these existing hazards. 
                  Access 
                  a.  Every subdivision and every lot within the subdivision shall be served by a publicly dedicated street, except as otherwise stated in these regulations. 
                  b.  When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets. 
                  c.  No subdivision shall be designed so as to completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land. 
                  Conformance to the Master Comprehensive Plan 
                  a.  All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the master comprehensive plan, zoning and subdivision regulations, and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the planning commission. 
                  b.  In subdivisions related to or affecting any state or federally numbered highway, the approval of the state department of transportation is required by the planning commission. 
                  c.  Where features of the comprehensive plan (other than minor streets and collector streets) such as school sites, parks, arterial streets, major thoroughfares, and other public spaces are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, or when these features have not been anticipated by the comprehensive plan and planning policy, but are considered essential by the planning commission, such features shall be reserved by the subdivider. Whenever such reserved land, or any portion thereof, is not acquired, optioned or condemned by the appropriate public agency within a one-year period from the date of recording the subdivision, the subdivider may claim the original reservation, or portion thereof, and subdivide it in a manner suitable to the provisions of these rules and regulations. 
                  d.  The planning commission may waive the above-mentioned reservation requirements whenever the public body responsible for land acquisition executes a written release stating that such a planned feature is not being acquired. 
                  e.  Whenever the plat proposes the dedication of land to public use and the planning commission or the appropriate agency finds that such land is not required or suitable for public use, the planning commission may either refuse to approve said plat or it may require the rearrangements of lots to include such land. 
                  Zoning and Other Regulations 
                  Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions as contained in these regulations and those contained in other official regulations or resolutions, the most restrictive regulations shall apply. 
                  Modifications to Subdivision Principles and Standards of Design 
                  a.  Modifications of the provisions contained in these rules and regulations may be recommended by the planning commission. The city council shall be the granting authority for such modifications. These modifications may be granted in specific cases when it is determined that undue hardship will result from strict compliance. This determination shall be based on the fact that unusual topographical or other exceptional conditions require such modifications. Furthermore, the granting of such modifications by the city council will not adversely affect the general public, create any public liability, or nullify the intent of these regulations; provided further that any such modifications shall not be made in instances where the hardship is a result of the actions of the subdivider. 
                  b.  Application for any modifications must be filed in writing with necessary supporting documents with the planning commission by the subdivider and shall explain in detail the reasons and facts supporting the application. Should any modification be granted by the city, the subdivider shall be notified in writing and such notice and modification shall be made part of the subdivision plats and plans and also the records of the planning commission. 
                  Name of Subdivision 
                  The name of the subdivision shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision, except where the subdivision is a section or part of a larger contiguous subdivision being developed by the same subdivider in phases, sections, or stages. In this case, the name of the overall subdivision can be used for each phase, stage, or section, but the phase or section number must also be included as part of the same. 
                  ARTICLE II -   

                  Section 1 - Design standards. 
                  Required Design Standards 
                  The design standards set forth in this article shall be observed in all plats which are presented before the planning commission for approval. In addition, those standards required for the installation of subdivision improvements as stated in section 2 of this article are required when applicable. 
                  Streets 
                  a.  The arrangements, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the city's major thoroughfare plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. 
                  b.  Where such is not shown in the city's major thoroughfare plan the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either: 
                  (1)  Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets in surrounding areas at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width. 
                  (2)  Conform to a plan for neighborhood streets that shall be approved or adopted by the planning commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other existing streets make it impracticable. 
                  c.  Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
                  d.  Where a subdivision contains a dead-end street other than a cul-de-sac, the planning commission may require the subdivider to provide a temporary vehicle turnaround within the right-of-way, when the planning commission considers such to be necessary for effective traffic circulation. 
                  e.  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the planning commission may require marginal access streets, double frontage lots with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property lines, deep lots with rear service drives, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through traffic and local traffic. 
                  f.  Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or limited access highway right-of-way, the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or industrial purpose in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
                  g.  Minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as follows: 

                   
                  h.  A proposed subdivision that includes a platted street that does not conform to the minimum right-of-way requirements of these regulations shall provide for the dedication of additional right-of-way along either one or both sides of said street so that a minimum right-of-way required by these regulations can be established. If the proposed subdivision abuts only one side of said street, then a minimum of one-half of the required extra right-of-way shall be dedicated or reserved by such subdivision. 
                  i.  Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle less than 75 degrees. Detailed designs of intersections may be required. 
                  j.  Curbline radius at street intersections shall be at least 20 feet and where the angle of street intersection is less than 90 degrees, the planning commission may require a greater radius. 
                  k.  Right-of-way radius at street intersections shall parallel the curbline radius.

In blocks over 1,000 feet long, the planning commission may, when existing or proposed public gathering places so justify, require public crosswalks across the block. 
                  c.  Residential blocks shall be wide enough to provide two tiers of lots, except where fronting on expressways and arterials or prevented by topographical conditions or size of the property, in which case the planning commission may require and/or approve a single tier of lots. 
                  Lots 
                  a.  Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines. Each lot shall abut upon a public street, except as otherwise provided. 
                  b.  The size, shape, and orientation of every lot shall be subject to approval of the planning commission for the type of development and use contemplated. No lot shall be more than four times as deep as it is wide at the building setback line, unless excepted by the planning commission. 
                  c.  Every residential lot shall conform to the minimum dimension and area requirements of the zoning regulations, provided that every lot not served by a public sewer or community sanitary sewage system and/or public water shall meet the dimension and area requirements of the health department. 
                  d.  Building setback lines shall conform to front, rear, and side yard building setback requirements of the zoning regulations. 
                  e.  Double-frontage lots, unless required by the planning commission, shall be prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography, orientation, and property size. A planting screen reservation of at least ten feet wide and across which there shall be no right of access may be required along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use. 
                  f.  Corner lots shall have extra width to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets. 
                  g.  Lot remnants (lots below minimum area or width left over after subdividing tracts of land) shall be prohibited. Such remnant areas shall be added to adjacent lots, rather than remain as unusable parcels. 
                  h.  The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide each lot with direct abutting access to an existing public street or to a street contained within the proposed subdivision. 
                  Section 2 - Required subdivision improvements. 
                  Monuments

The top of the monument shall have an indented cross to identify properly the location and shall be set flush with the finished grade. 
                  b.  Property line monument. An iron pin imbedded at least two feet into the ground shall be required at each lot corner and each point where the property line changes direction. Such iron pin shall be at least one-half inch in diameter. The top surface of such iron pin shall be approximately level with the ground surface. 
                  Construction Plan Requirements 
                  Construction plans for the construction of new roads, storm drainage systems and utilities and for the improvement of existing roads, storm drainage systems and utilities shall be submitted to the city for review and approval, prior to the beginning of any construction activity. A professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia shall prepare the construction plans. Plan and profile drawings shall be provided for roads, storm drainage systems and sanitary sewer systems. Design calculations shall be provided for storm drainage and sanitary sewer systems. Size of water mains to be installed shall be determined by the city engineer. 
                  Special Classification of Streets for Construction 
                  All streets except expressways, arterials, and collectors shall be classified for construction purposes only as follows: 
                  a.  Class I street. A class I street shall be paved in accordance with the specifications required herein. A class I street shall be required for all streets in all zoning districts except A-1 agricultural districts, but may be so located if the subdivider so desires. Minimum right-of-way width requirements shall be as required in these regulations (chart I). 
                  b.  Class I primary street. A class I primary street is a main street through or around a subdivision which functions as a collector for subdivision traffic and provides access to arterial/collector thoroughfares and other subdivisions. 
                  c.  Class I secondary street. All streets within a subdivision not classified as primary streets shall be classified secondary streets. 
                  d.  Class II street. A class II street shall be paved in accordance with the specifications required herein, but no curbs and gutters shall be required. A class II street shall be required as a minimum for all streets in A-1 agricultural districts. Minimum right-of-way width requirements for a class II street shall be as required in chart I of these regulations. 
                  Additional Street Design Requirements 
                  a.  Grades, horizontal curves, tangents, and sight distances. The following street design requirements shall be adhered to in addition to other requirements stated herein: 

                   
                  b.  Vertical curves. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of minimum length in feet equal to 15 times the algebraic difference in percent of grades for expressways, freeways, arterial, and collector streets, and one-half this minimum length for other streets. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals 100 feet horizontally and one inch equals ten feet vertically may be required by the planning commission. 
                  Basic Construction Requirements for All Classes of Streets 
                  a.  Grading. All streets, roads, and alleys shall be graded to provide the necessary paving, roadway, drainage, and safety requirements. The preparation of the right-of-way before grading is started and the construction of cuts and fills shall be accomplished in accordance with the requirements herein and other specifications such as the soil erosion and sedimentation act of the planning commission and the governing body. 
                  b.  Storm drainage. A stormwater management plan shall be prepared and submitted to the city for review and approval in accordance with the City of Byron stormwater management ordinance. 
                  An adequate storm drainage system shall be provided. Storm drainage systems include curb and gutter, storm drainage inlets, pipes, culverts, driveway pipes, headwalls and ditches. Design of the storm drainage system shall be based on the 25-year storm frequency except as otherwise noted herein, and shall have adequate capacity for stormwater generated on site by the proposed subdivision and for stormwater generated off site upstream of the proposed subdivision. Individual segments of storm drainage systems shall be designed to perform as integral parts of the overall system in conformance with the stormwater management plan. 
                  Roadway culverts shall be designed to pass the 100-year storm event such that the maximum headwater at the culvert inlet will not exceed the elevation of the bottom of the road subgrade at the low point. Driveway culverts shall be sized to pass the 50-year storm event without overtopping the driveway at the low point. 
                  On roads constructed with curb and gutter, a sufficient number of inlets shall be provided to remove stormwater from the roadway such that the spread of stormwater in the street does not extend further than the middle of the first travel lane during the 25-year storm event. 
                  c.  Installation of utilities. After grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied, all of the underground utilities—water mains, sewer mains, gas mains, and all service connections related thereto—shall be installed completely and approved throughout the length of the street. All driveways for houses to be built by the subdivider shall be cut and drained. Where the utility mains are off the pavements, the subdivider may elect to omit the installation of service connections providing that at such time as these service connections are needed, they may be jacked across the street without breaking or weakening the existing pavement. 
                  d.  Slopes and shoulder improvements. The minimum ratio for all fill and cut slopes (including drainage ditches) shall be two to one and the minimum width for all shoulders from back edge to the curb, if installed, shall be eight feet. All shoulders shall slope one-half inch to the foot. When all construction is completed, all slopes and shoulders shall be cleared of all rubbish and shall have a stand of perennial grass to prevent undue erosion, either by sprigging or seeding. 
                  Roadway Surfacing and Paving 
                  a.  Minimum pavement width. All minor residential streets paved after the adoption of these regulations shall have a minimum pavement width of 23 feet from inside of curb and gutter to inside of curb and gutter, or 24 feet from edge of pavement to edge of pavement if no curb and gutters are installed. The outside pavement for a cul-de-sac turnaround shall be a minimum diameter of 80 feet. All other street width pavements shall be determined by the planning commission as required by the intended or desired street function. Minimum standards are provided in charts I and II of article II. 
                  b.  Pavement breaks for utility connections. When it is necessary for a subdivider, or any utility company, to break existing pavement for the installation of utilities, for drainage facilities, or for any other purpose, the subdivider, or utility company, shall be financially responsible for the repair of the pavement. The pavement shall be repaired in accordance with the specifications stated in these regulations for construction of streets. 
                  c.  Curbs and gutters. Either the regular six-inch or four-inch roll-over concrete curbs and gutters with a minimum overall width of 24 inches shall be constructed on all residential class I streets. Commercial and industrial class I streets shall require the regular six-inch curb. Cement concrete valley gutter shall be permitted across minor residential streets at street intersections only when no storm sewers are available as determined by the zoning enforcement officer. Valley gutters shall be at least six feet in width. Whenever driveway openings are provided for lots abutting the street, the driveway shall be six inches thick and a minimum of ten feet in width at the sidewalk or at the street right-of-way line. The driveway shall have a five-foot radius at the curbline for low density residential uses, and a ten- to 20-foot radius for all other uses. 
                  d.  Curb markings for utility connections. Where utilities are enter under the street pavement, a letter identifying the particular utility (W-water, S-sewer, G-gas) shall be etched into the curb. Such letter shall be approximately three inches in height. 
                  e.  Grassed medians. No curb shall be required for a grassed median on residential streets providing such medians are designed to slope towards the outside curb of a street or contain an adequate drainage system within the median. 
                  Installation of Utilities 
                  a.  Water. Water mains for both domestic use and fire protection (six-inch minimum) shall be properly connected with the public water system, or with an alternate water supply approved by the county health department. The lines shall be constructed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots shown on the subdivision plat. 
                  b.  Sewer. A publicly connected sanitary sewer system shall be installed when any portion of the subdivision is within 500 feet of an existing trunk or collector sewer line. Where lots are not connected with a sanitary sewer system, they must contain adequate area for the installation of approved septic tank and disposal fields approved by the county health department. All sewer facilities shall be installed in accordance with the standards of the environmental protection division of the State of Georgia department of natural resources. 
                  c.  Gas. When gas mains are connected with a gas distribution system, the lines shall be installed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots shown on the subdivision plats. The gas lines shall be constructed in conformance with the technical standards as established by the planning commission which shall be in accordance with the utility owner. 
                  Sidewalks and Street Signs 
                  a.  Sidewalks. When provided or at the requirement of the commission and unless otherwise specified, sidewalks shall be four inches thick with a minimum width of four feet. A ten-foot grass planting strip shall be provided between the back of the curb and the sidewalk along collector and arterial streets, and a three-foot strip along minor streets. For class II streets, the sidewalk shall be located on the right-of-way line side of the drainage ditch located parallel to the street. No planting strip shall be required between marginal access roads and sidewalks. All sidewalks shall slope one-fourth inch to the foot toward the pavement. 
                  b.  Sidewalks in subdivisions. Sidewalks shall be provided in the following types of subdivisions: 
                  (1)  In all commercial zones; 
                  (2)  In all subdivisions within one-half mile of a school or other facilities likely to attract pedestrian traffic at such volume that the welfare of the public requires the installation of sidewalks. 
                  c.  Location of street signs. All streets shall be designed by name on a metal street signpost approved by the planning commission with such metal post having nameplates of metal set one above the other with a clearance of seven feet. The post shall be so located as to be visible for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. At cross-street intersections, two signposts shall be located diagonally across the intersection from each other. Only one street signpost shall be required at T-street intersections. 
                  Administrative Procedures 
                  The administrative procedures for installing the subdivision improvements required herein shall be as follows: 
                  a.  When construction may begin. Construction and installation of any required public improvements as described in these regulations shall not begin until the planning commission has given preliminary plat approval for the new subdivision. 
                  b.  Inspections and approval. During the construction and installation of the required public improvements, the zoning enforcement officer shall from time to time make field inspections and supervise the work as predetermined and agreed upon by the zoning enforcement officer and the subdivider. After completion of all the construction and installation of the required public improvements, and if the work has met the specifications as described herein, the zoning enforcement officer shall notify the subdivider in writing of the approval of said work. 
                  c.  Official acceptance by the city. The city shall officially accept the completed work on the construction and installation of required public improvements not less than one year from the date of the written acceptance by the zoning enforcement officer, but not before approval by the planning commission of the final plat and/or any "as-built" plans which may be required. 
                  d.  Cashier's checks. If the subdivider does not wish to construct and install any or all of the required public improvements as described herein prior to submitting the subdivision plat to the planning commission for final approval, a cashier's check shall be required, such check being equal to the estimated cost of construction. When the work has been completed satisfactorily, the city shall release 90 percent of the funds with a letter of approval to the subdivider. The remaining ten percent shall apply toward the subdivider's required maintenance bond. The cost of any corrective work required shall be deducted from the funds. 
                  e.  Maintenance of completed work. The subdivider shall maintain his completed work until the official acceptance by the city as described above. The subdivider shall then be required to sign a maintenance agreement with the city for one year. A maintenance bond is to be posted by the subdivider in an amount equal to ten percent of the construction cost. During the maintenance period the zoning enforcement officer shall make periodic inspections and notify the subdivider of necessary corrections. At the end of the maintenance period, the zoning enforcement officer shall make a final inspection and report his findings to the city. Necessary corrections not made by the subdivider will be completed by the city. The cost of making such corrections shall be deducted from the maintenance funds and/or collected from the subdivider and the bonding company. If the work is acceptable at the end of the maintenance period, the maintenance bond shall expire and/or any remaining funds shall be released to the subdivider. 
                  f.  Subdivider's responsibility. The subdivider shall incur the cost of construction and installation of all required public improvements based on the following: 
                  (1)  Streets. Incur the cost for the construction of all required pavement and curbs/gutters. 
                  (2)  Water and sewer systems. Incur the cost for the installation of all water and sewer systems which are required to serve the new subdivision and tie in with existing water and sewer systems, based on the specifications set forth herein. 
                  (3)  Sidewalks. Entire cost if approved. 
                  (4)  Monuments. Entire cost. 
                  (5)  Street name signs. Entire cost. 
                  g.  City responsibility. The city shall partially participate in sharing the cost of construction and installation of required public improvements for the following conditions: 
                  (1)  Streets. Incur cost for any additional pavement which may be required in excess of the minimum requirements [for] any related additional grading and paving. 
                  (2)  Water and sewer systems. Incur the cost for any difference in the cost of oversized pipe and outfall systems which may be needed in excess of the required water and sewer facilities needed to exclusively serve the new subdivision as determined by the planning commission. 
                  h.  Estimated costs for construction and installation. The current unit prices in effect at the time of submission of plans plus ten percent shall be used in determining the total estimated cost for construction and installation of required public improvements in new subdivisions.

                  This ordinance is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the City of Byron, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the City of Byron so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the City of Byron as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this ordinance shall: 
                  (1)  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the City of Byron; 
                  (2)  Protect the City of Byron's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities; 
                  (3)  Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
                  (4)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennae; 
                  (5)  Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; 
                  (6)  Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and 
                  (7)  Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.

                  Section VI. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities. 
                  (1)  General requirements for all telecommunications facilities: The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance unless the governing authority reduces the standards if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby: 
                  (a)  Building codes and safety standards: To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The result of such inspection shall be provided to the zoning official. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia. 
                  (b)  Regulatory compliance: 
                  1.  All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 
                  2.  Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  3.  An applicant or owner must comply with all applicable provisions of Part IV, Article II, section 4, special structure height requirements of the Byron Zoning Ordinance and must provide to the zoning official certification from Robins Air Force Base that the telecommunications tower will not interfere with the operations of the Base, and shall comply with all other applicable sections of the Byron Zoning Ordinance. 
                  4.  Failure to bring towers and antenna into compliance with such standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for removal of the tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia. 
                  (c)  Security: All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. A black or nonobtrusive vinyl clad chain-link fence or wall not less than eight feet in height from finished grade shall be provided around each communication tower or antenna. Barbed wire shall not be used along the top of the fence or wall. Access to the tower or antenna shall be through a locked gate. 
                  (d)  Lighting: Illumination of the telecommunications facilities shall be provided as required by the FCC and FAA, or other federal or state agencies having jurisdiction regarding air traffic control or other illumination requirements. Security lighting or other lighting not required by the aforementioned agencies, but acceptable to them, may require approval by the zoning enforcement officer to ensure the least disturbance possible to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  (e)  Advertising: No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this ordinance are met. 
                  (f)  Visual impact: 
                  1.  Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  2.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background. 
                  3.  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. 
                  4.  Telecommunications facilities shall not be sited where they negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter. 
                  5.  Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
                  (g)  Landscaping: 
                  1.  Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property. 
                  2.  Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. 
                  3.  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  4.  Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the governing authority to assure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this section. 
                  5.  The governing authority may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes; for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms; or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the governing authority. 
                  (h)  Maintenance impacts: Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street. 
                  (i)  Principal, accessory and joint uses: 
                  1.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility. 
                  2.  Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 
                  (j)  Lot size and setbacks: 
                  1.  The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities. 
                  i.  Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any residential property line and all public rights-of-way. 
                  2.  For antennas attached to the roof of a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot-high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact. 
                  (k)  Change of ownership: Upon the transfer of ownership of an interest in any tower, antenna or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the governing authority of the transaction in writing within 30 days. 
                  (l)  Time limit of project completion: Once a communication tower or antenna is approved, a permit shall be obtained within one year and the project shall be completed within one year of approval by the city.

                  2.  If the applicant does not know specific future tower and antenna site locations but does know of areas where telecommunications facilities will be needed within the next five years to provide service, the applicant shall list the assessor's blocks contained within the anticipated geographic service area and identify each geographic service area with a number that will correspond to the future telecommunication facility site. 
                  (c)  Additional information requirements for towers: 
                  1.  If the proposed site is zoned I-1 or A-1 and applicant has requested an alternative site in a different zoning district, applicant must justify why sites in I-1 or A-1 have not been proposed. The governing authority will review with special care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The governing authority shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site. 
                  2.  Applicants must identify all existing towers and all towers for which there are applications currently on file with the governing authority. Applicants must provide evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna. If collocation on any such towers would result in less visual impact than the visual impact of the proposed tower, applicants must justify why such collocation is not being proposed. If collocation on any such tower would increase negative visual impact, then the applicant must so state and demonstrate. The governing authority will review with special care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The governing authority shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site. 
                  3.  In all zones, applicants must demonstrate that they cannot provide personal wireless communication service without the use of a telecommunications tower. 
                  4.  The applicant must provide a utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power lines impacting the proposed tower site. 
                  5.  An application fee shall be charged in the amount set forth by the schedule determined by the city council. 
                  (d)  The applicant must provide any other information which may be requested by the governing authority to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed telecommunications facility. 
                  (e)  The governing authority may share any information submitted by an applicant under this ordinance with other applicants, organizations and persons, provided, however, that the governing authority is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such information is accurate or that the sites identified are available or suitable for a telecommunications facility. 
                  (2)  Special exception permit. Application for a special exception permit shall be required for the construction of any proposed tower or antenna to be located within any site zoned I-1 or A-1 that is not a permitted use under part IV, article III of the Byron Land Development, Zoning Ordinance [this appendix A]. 
                  (a)  All requirements set forth in section VI shall be met. 
                  (b)  Additionally, the following factors may be taken into consideration in acting upon an application for special exception use: 
                  1.  The proximity of the tower or antenna(s) to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
                  2.  The nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  3.  The surrounding topography; 
                  4.  The surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
                  5.  The design of the tower or antenna(s), with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
                  6.  The proposed ingress and egress; 
                  7.  The availability of suitable existing towers or other structures for antenna collocation; 
                  8.  The impact of the proposed tower or antenna(s) upon scenic views and visual quality of the surrounding area; 
                  9.  The needs of the applicant as balanced against the detrimental effects on surrounding properties; and 
                  10.  The impact of the proposed tower or antenna(s) on adjacent and nearby properties. 
                  (c)  In granting a special exception permit, the governing authority may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties. 
                  (d)  Any denial of a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications facility located within a special exception zoning district shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.

                  (Ord. of 10-9-2000(1)) 
                  Section XI. - Preexisting towers/nonconforming uses. 
                  (1)  All telecommunications facilities approved or operating on the effective day of this ordinance shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a nonconforming use and shall be treated as a nonconforming use in accordance with [part IV,] article II, section 5 of the Byron Land Development, Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulation [this appendix A]. Routine maintenance shall be permitted on such existing telecommunications facilities. New construction other than routine maintenance shall comply with the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  (2)  Placement of an antenna on a nonconforming structure shall not be considered an expansion of the nonconforming structure.

The court shall have the power and authority to place any person guilty of violation of this ordinance on probation and to suspend or modify any fine or sentence. As a condition of such suspension, the court may require payment of restitution or impose other punishment allowed by law. 
                  (2)  If any structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained in violation of this ordinance or without obtaining the required permits, or if any building, structure or land is used in violation of this article [part], the city's attorney, in addition to any other remedies, may institute proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use or to correct or abate such violations.
