PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACEThis Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Ty Ty, Georgia.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the City Council, through
August 2, 2010. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end
thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the
adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate
any ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within
each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and
which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their
location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local
government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash
refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.
Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this
system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their
proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one
section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would
be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles,
may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the
end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or
division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that
the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an
abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents
the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon
indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of
the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may
or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several
headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language
generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the
indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is
interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the
publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be
properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders
of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete
pages.
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised
pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted
according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be
inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and
filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Mary McEwen, Code Attorney, Jim Jenkins, Sr. Code
Attorney, and Colleen Dalton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is
gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance
throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Sherry J. Boyett, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the
progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a
Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City of Ty Ty readily accessible to all citizens and
which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  An ordinance may be introduced by any councilmember and be read at a regular or special meeting of the city
                  council. Ordinances shall be considered and adopted or rejected by the city council in accordance with the rules

                  emergency exists and describing the emergency in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be
                  adopted, with or without amendment, or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote
                  of at least three councilmembers shall be required for adoption. It shall become effective upon adoption or at
                  such later time as it may specify. Every emergency ordinance shall automatically stand repealed 30 days
                  following the date upon which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the
                  manner specified in this section if the emergency continues to exist. An emergency ordinance shall also be
                  repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of
                  emergency ordinances.

                  distribution and filing of copies of the ordinance shall be construed to include copies of any code of technical
                  regulations, as well as the adopting ordinance; and (2) a copy of each adopted code of technical regulations, as
                  well as the adopting ordinance, shall be authenticated and recorded by the clerk pursuant to Section 3.20 of this
                  Charter.
                  (b)

                  council shall make such further arrangements as deemed desirable with reproduction and distribution of any

                  these taxes by installments or in one lump sum, as well as authorize the voluntary payment of taxes prior to the
                  time when due.
                  Section 6.12. - Occupation taxes and business license fees.
                  The city council by ordinance shall have the power to levy such occupation or business taxes as are not denied
                  by law. Such taxes may be levied on both individuals and corporations who transact business in this city or who
                  practice or offer to practice any profession or calling within the city to the extent such persons have a
                  constitutionally sufficient nexus to this city to be so taxed. The city council may classify businesses, occupations,
                  professions, or callings for the purpose of such taxation in any way which may be lawful and may compel the
                  payment of such taxes as provided in Section 6.18 of this Charter.
                  Section 6.13. - Licenses.

                  business in this city or who practices or offers to practice any profession or calling within the city to obtain a
                  license or permit for such activity from the city and pay a reasonable fee for such license or permit where such
                  activities are not now regulated by general law in such a way as to preclude city regulations. Such fees may
                  reflect the total cost to the city of regulating the activity and, if unpaid, shall be collected as provided in Section
                  6.18 of this Charter. The city council by ordinance may establish reasonable requirements for obtaining or
                  keeping such licenses as the public health, safety, and welfare necessitate.
                  Section 6.14. - Franchises.

                  purposes of railroads, street railways, telephone companies, electric companies, cable television companies, gas
                  companies, transportation companies, and other similar organizations. The city council shall determine the
                  duration, terms, whether the same shall be exclusive or nonexclusive, and the consideration for such franchises;
                  provided, however, that no franchise shall be granted for a period in excess of 35 years and no franchise shall be
                  granted unless the city receives just and adequate compensation therefor. The city council shall provide for the
                  registration of all franchises with the city clerk in a registration book kept by him. The city council may provide
                  by ordinance for the registration within a reasonable time of all franchises previously granted; provided,
                  however, that this provision shall not affect any contract in effect on the effective date of this Act.

                  This city shall be empowered to levy any other tax allowed now or hereafter by law, and the specific mention of
                  any right, power, or authority in this article shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers of
                  this city to govern its local affairs.
                  Section 6.18. - Collection of delinquent taxes.

                  of the persons required to pay the taxes or fees imposed, revoking city licenses for failure to pay any city taxes or

                  exercised in accordance with the laws governing bond issuance by municipalities in effect at the time said issue
                  is undertaken.
                  Section 6.20. - Revenue bonds.
                  Revenue bonds may be issued by the city council as state law now or hereafter provides. Such bonds are to be

                  to the scope, content, and form of such budgets and programs.
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  28/321
                  Section 6.24. - Operating budget.
                  On or before a date fixed by the city council but not later than 60 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year,
                  the mayor shall submit to the city council a proposed operating budget for the ensuing fiscal year. The budget
                  shall be accompanied by a message from the mayor containing a statement of the general fiscal policies of the
                  city, the important features of the budget, explanations of major changes recommended for the next fiscal year, a
                  general summary of the budget, and such other comments and information as he may deem pertinent. The

                  (a)
                  The city council may amend the operating budget proposed by the mayor, except that the budget as finally
                  amended and adopted must provide for all expenditures required by state law or by other provisions of this
                  Charter and for all debt service requirements for the ensuing fiscal year. The total appropriations from any fund
                  shall not exceed the estimated fund balance, reserves, and revenues.
                  (b)
                  After the conducting of a budget hearing, the city council shall adopt the final operating budget for the ensuing
                  fiscal year not later than December 31 of each year. If the city council fails to adopt the budget by said date, the
                  amounts appropriated for operation for the then current fiscal year shall be deemed adopted for the ensuing fiscal
                  year on a month-to-month basis, with all items prorated accordingly, until such time as the city council adopts a
                  budget for the ensuing fiscal year. Adoption of the budget shall take the form of an appropriations ordinance
                  setting out the estimated revenues in detail by sources and making appropriations according to fund and by
                  organizational unit, purpose, or activity as set out in the budget preparation ordinance adopted pursuant to
                  Section 6.23 of this Charter.
                  (c)
                  The amount set out in the adopted operating budget for each organizational unit shall constitute the annual
                  appropriation for such, and no expenditure shall be made or encumbrance created in excess of the otherwise
                  unencumbered balance of the appropriations or allotments thereof to which it is chargeable.
                  Section 6.26. - Levy of taxes.
                  Following adoption of the operating budget, the city council shall levy by ordinance such taxes as are necessary.
                  The taxes and tax rates set by such ordinance shall be such that reasonable estimates of revenues from such levy
                  shall at least be sufficient, together with other anticipated revenues, fund balances, and applicable reserves, to
                  equal the total amount appropriated for each of the several funds set forth in the annual operating budget for
                  defraying the expense of the general government of this city.
                  Section 6.27. - Changes in budget.
                  The city council by majority vote may make changes in the appropriations contained in the current operating

                  year, the mayor shall submit to the city council a proposed capital improvements budget with his
                  recommendations as to the means of financing the improvements proposed for the ensuing year. The city council
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  29/321
                  shall have the power to accept, with or without amendments, or reject the proposed program and proposed means
                  of financing. The city council shall not authorize an expenditure for the construction of any building, structure,
                  work, or improvement, unless the appropriations for such project are included in the capital improvements
                  budget, except to meet a public emergency as provided in Section 3.17 of this Charter.
                  (b)
                  After the conducting of a public hearing, the city council shall adopt by ordinance the final capital improvements
                  budget for the ensuing fiscal year not later than December 31 of each year. No appropriations provided for in a
                  prior capital improvements budget shall lapse until the purpose for which the appropriations were made shall
                  have been accomplished or abandoned; provided, however, the mayor may submit amendments to the capital
                  improvements budget at any time during the fiscal year, accompanied by his recommendations. Any such
                  amendments to the capital improvements budget shall become effective only upon adoption by majority vote of
                  the city council.
                  Section 6.29. - Audits.
                  There shall be an annual independent audit of all city accounts, funds, and financial transactions by a certified
                  public accountant selected by the city council. The audit shall be conducted according to generally accepted
                  accounting principles. Any audit of any funds by the state or federal government may be accepted as satisfying
                  the requirements of this Charter. Copies of all audit reports shall be available at printing costs to the public.
                  Section 6.30. - Procurement and property management.
                  No contract with the city shall be binding on the city unless:

                  It is in writing;
                  (2)
                  It is drawn or submitted and reviewed by the city attorney and, as a matter of course, is signed by him to indicate
                  such drafting or review; and
                  (3)
                  It is made or authorized by the city council and such approval is entered in the city council journal of
                  proceedings pursuant to Section 3.14 of this Charter.

                  or other purposes as now or hereafter provided by law.
                  (b)
                  The city council may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon request
                  by the mayor and adoption of a resolution, both finding that the property is not needed for public or other
                  purposes and that the interest of the city has no readily ascertainable monetary value.
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  30/321
                  (c)

                  or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the city, the
                  city council may authorize the mayor to execute and deliver in the name of the city a deed conveying said cut-off
                  or separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining property owner or owners in exchange for rights of
                  way of said street, avenue, alley, or public place when such exchange is deemed to be in the best interest of the
                  city. All deeds and conveyances heretofore and hereafter so executed and delivered shall convey all title and
                  interest the city has in such property, notwithstanding the fact that no public sale after advertisement was or is
                  hereafter made.

                  In the construction of this Code and of all ordinances, the following rules shall be observed unless such
                  construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the mayor and city council or unless the context
                  clearly requires otherwise:
                  (1)
                  General rule. All words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common and approved
                  usage of the language; but technical words and phrases and such others as may have acquired a peculiar and
                  appropriate meaning in the law shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate
                  meaning. In all interpretations, the courts shall look diligently for the intention of the city council, keeping in
                  view, at all times, the old law, the evil, and the remedy. Grammatical errors shall not vitiate, and a transposition
                  of words and clauses may be resorted to when the sentence or clause is without meaning as it stands.
                  (2)
                  Liberal construction; minimum requirements; overlapping provisions. All general provisions, terms, phrases and
                  expressions contained in this Code shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of the
                  city council may be fully carried out. In the interpretation and application of any provision of this Code, they
                  shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort,
                  convenience and general welfare. Where any provision of this Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject
                  matter than the other provisions of this Code, the provision imposing the greater restriction or regulation shall be
                  deemed to be controlling. The specific controls over the general.

                  Joint authority. All words purporting to give a joint authority to three or more city officers or other persons shall
                  be construed as giving such authority to a majority of such officers or other persons unless it shall be otherwise
                  expressly declared in the law giving the authority.
                  (7)
                  Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision requires the head of a department or other officer of the city to do
                  some act or perform some duty, it shall be construed to authorize such department head or officer to designate,
                  delegate and authorize subordinates to do the required act or perform the required duty unless the terms of the
                  provision designate otherwise.

                  injunctive or other equitable relief and by such other means as are provided by law. The imposition of a penalty
                  does not prevent equitable relief.

                  violations by requiring labor, O.C.G.A. § 36-30-8.

                  jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent portion. Such declaration shall not
                  affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof, which other portions shall continue in full force and effect,
                  unless the portion declared invalid would clearly and unequivocally cause the remainder of the ordinance to have
                  a meaning contrary to its original meaning before a portion of the ordinance was declared invalid. Any portion
                  that is declared invalid will be stricken from the ordinance; and the remaining portion of the ordinance shall
                  continue and remain valid and enforceable unless the ordinance as it remains would clearly be contrary to the
                  intent of the council when it was enacted.

                  pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they

                  38/321

                  the supplement.
                  (b)
                  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded
                  from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.
                  (c)
                  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier, meaning the person authorized to prepare the
                  supplement, may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the
                  supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier
                  may:
                  (1)
                  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions.
                  (2)
                  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the
                  supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles.
                  (3)
                  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to
                  accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers.
                  (4)
                  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division,"
                  etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________," inserting section numbers to indicate
                  the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code.
                  (5)
                  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted
                  into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material
                  included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.
                  Sec. 1-11. - Rates, charges, or fees established.
                  (a)
                  Unless otherwise provided for, all rates, charges, or fees necessary for the administration and enforcement of the
                  provisions of this Code shall be as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution or ordinance of the
                  city council from time to time. Any rates, charges, or fees established by the city pursuant to the regulations or
                  requirements established herein may be changed from time to time by the city council, and such changes shall
                  both be considered an amendment to this Code.
                  (b)
                  Whenever any provision of this Code provides that a rate, charge, or fee shall be established by the city council
                  from time to time, and the amount of such rate, charge, or fee is not expressed in this Code in any dollar amount,
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  39/321
                  then the amount of such rate, charge, or fee shall be the most recent and latest amount established, set or fixed by
                  the city council by ordinance, resolution or motion.
                  Sec. 1-12. - Ordinances not affected by Code.
                  (a)
                  Nothing in this Code or the ordinance adopting this Code shall be construed to repeal or otherwise affect the

                  These regulations and restrictions shall be known and may be cited as the City of Ty Ty, Georgia "Liability for
                  Injuries and Damages Ordinance."

                  Sec. 2-20. - Jurisdiction.
                  These regulations and restrictions shall govern any injuries and/or damages to any person or property caused by
                  the City of Ty Ty, its employees, agents, or property.

                  Sec. 2-21. - Purpose.
                  These regulations and restrictions on the liability of the City of Ty Ty are imposed and designed to limit the
                  liability of the City of Ty Ty and to protect public funds held by the City of Ty Ty from paying for the private
                  claims of any party who contends that they were injured or damaged by the actions or failure to act by the City of
                  Ty Ty.
                  (Ord. No. 1997-2, § 3, 5-5-1997)
                  Sec. 2-22. - Regulations and restrictions.
                  Except to the extent provided by federal or state law, the city shall not be liable to any person or entity for any
                  injuries, damages, claims, costs, or expenses caused by the city, its property, its employees, or its agents
                  concerning any actions or failure to act by anyone connected with the city except as is otherwise set out in this
                  article. It is the intention of this article that except where limited herein the city will claim its right to sovereign
                  immunity so as to prevent it from being held responsible for any claims for injuries or damages alleged to be
                  caused by the negligence or tortuous conduct of the city. The following regulations and restrictions shall apply
                  and control:
                  (1)
                  The city council may at its discretion hear any complaint by any citizen for reimbursement of any damages or
                  injuries for which they feel the city is responsible. To the extent that the city actually pays to such citizen a
                  certain sum of money, then the sovereign immunity of the city shall be waived as to the amount actually paid and
                  only to that amount. Any payment received by a citizen shall be payment in full satisfaction of any and all such
                  claims against the city.
                  (2)
                  The city will not consider reimbursing any person for any damages or injuries unless the city council considers
                  the matter and pays for the damages prior to any repairs being completed. This provision may be waived by the
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  42/321
                  city council only in the event that emergency repairs are required to prevent any further damages to such person's
                  property.
                  (3)
                  The city shall not be liable to any citizen for any water or sewer damage that is done to the property of any
                  person located in the city and caused by the water or sewer system of the city.
                  (4)
                  The city shall not be required under any circumstances to go onto the private property of any person located in
                  the city to make any type of repairs, including but not limited to the digging out of any ditches or debris caused
                  by water drainage.
                  (5)
                  To the extent that the city has insurance to cover any loss, damages, or injuries sustained by any person, said
                  person may proceed against the insurance company to obtain compensation for its injuries or damages. In no
                  event, however, shall the city be required to pay any amount and sovereign immunity shall only be waived to the
                  extent that any person may be entitled to receive benefits from said insurance company and only to the extent
                  that said insurance company pays for such damages or injuries. Nothing contained herein shall require the city to
                  keep or maintain any insurance.
                  (6)
                  Nothing contained herein shall prevent any citizen from making any claim against any independent contractor
                  that damages a citizen's property who was hired by the city.
                  (7)
                  The city shall not be liable to any person who is injured while upon the property of the city regardless of the
                  cause of such injury.
                  (8)
                  In the event that the city has insurance to cover a particular situation or in the event that a third party with whom
                  the city contracts damages an individual citizen's property, then the city at the city council's discretion may elect
                  to assist the citizen in trying to collect either from the insurance company or from said independent contractor.
                  However, nothing herein shall require the city to take any such action.

                  ARTICLE III. - LEGISLATIVE BODY
                  Sec. 2-48. - Ordinance defined.
                  An ordinance is hereby defined as being any law, statute, or enactment passed by the city council of a general
                  nature which would apply to or could affect a substantial number of citizens in the city. Provided, however, that
                  any enactment by the city no matter how specific and no matter how limited in application which is entitled an
                  ordinance and which is passed with the same formality of an ordinance shall also be considered an ordinance and
                  shall be deemed a specific ordinance regardless of whether or not said ordinance is labeled a specific ordinance.

                  43/321
                  All other actions taken by the city council which are not ordinances shall be deemed resolutions of the city.
                  Resolutions shall have the effect and force of laws and shall be binding on the city and its residents, invitees, and
                  guests unless and until repealed by the city council.
                  (Ord. No. 95-1, § H, 5-1-1995)
                  Sec. 2-50. - Enactment of resolutions.
                  Any resolution may be enacted by the city council upon such resolution being presented either in writing or
                  verbally at any meeting of the city council, and said resolutions shall become effective immediately upon a
                  majority of the councilmembers being present if a quorum exists voting in favor of said resolution. Provided,
                  however, that the mayor of the city may veto any resolution within three days of the council meeting in which
                  said resolution was passed if the mayor was actually present at said meeting. In the event that the mayor is not
                  present at said meeting, then he may veto said legislation within three days after he receives written notice of the
                  enactment or passage of said resolution. Provided, further, that if any two councilmembers or the mayor standing
                  alone wish to bring any resolution up for another vote, they may do so either at the next regular meeting or at a
                  special called meeting called for that purpose unless the city council has already taken actions which cannot be
                  easily undone which would materially affect the city or any inhabitant of the city relying on such resolution. If
                  upon a new vote the resolution is voted down, then the resolution shall be stricken from the record if the
                  resolution has been in existence for a period of less than 40 days. Any resolution may be repealed by a majority
                  vote of the city council if said resolution has been in existence for over 40 days.

                  Any expenditure by the city in the ordinary course of business shall be carried out by the city employees under
                  other rules and regulations established by the council or the mayor. Any matters not in the ordinary course of
                  business concerning expenditures of less than $7,500.00 shall be handled by a resolution of the city council. Any
                  expenditure not in the ordinary course of business for a sum in excess of $7,500.00 shall be handled as an
                  ordinance by the city.

                  time by the appropriate vote of the city council.

                  regulations:
                  (1)
                  The clerk shall prepare an agenda for the regular monthly meetings of the city council. In the event that a regular
                  monthly meeting is continued to a later date, the council shall take up the remainder of the agenda in the order
                  prepared unless there is good cause to deviate from the order of the agenda.
                  (2)
                  Before any special called meeting of the city council may be held, the city council members shall be given at
                  least 48 hours' notice of such meeting. Only the matters presented in the notice shall be heard at any special
                  called meeting. Any member may waive his lack of sufficient notice, and any member attending any special
                  called meeting shall automatically waive his lack of sufficient notice unless he objects at the beginning of the
                  meeting to such lack of notice.

                  shall govern the conduct of the meeting.
                  (4)
                  The clerk will prepare an agenda and provide a copy of the same to the mayor and each member of the council
                  by the Saturday prior to the regular monthly meeting of the council. Any councilmember failing to receive such
                  agenda may waive his lack of timely receipt of a notice of the agenda, and the same shall be considered waived
                  automatically if said councilmember does not object immediately upon the opening of the regular meeting by the
                  person conducting the meeting.
                  (5)
                  Any person or group of persons desiring to be heard on any matter by the city council shall follow the following
                  rules and procedures:
                  a.
                  The city clerk must be notified prior to 12:00 noon on the Friday before the regular scheduled monthly meeting
                  of each person who desires to speak to the council and the matter about which the person wishes to speak.
                  b.
                  Any person who later discovers that he will not be able to attend the meeting must notify the clerk before 12:00
                  noon on the day of said meeting that they wish to have their name withdrawn from speaking at said meeting.
                  c.
                  Any person who notifies the clerk that they wish to speak at the next regular monthly meeting of the city council
                  and who fails to attend said meeting without notifying the clerk prior to 12:00 noon on the day of said meeting

                  45/321
                  shall not be allowed to speak on the issue requested at any subsequent meeting of the city council for a period of
                  one year from the date that said person was scheduled to speak. The mayor and city council can waive this
                  restriction only if the reason for failing to notify the clerk within the required time was due to a dire emergency
                  or if in the opinion of the mayor and city council there would be a manifest abuse of justice not to hear the
                  person on the issue involved.
                  d.
                  Any person or group of persons desiring to be heard by the council who fails to notify the clerk by 12:00 noon
                  on the Friday before the regular scheduled meeting shall not be heard by the council at that meeting but may be
                  heard by the council at the next regular monthly meeting if said person or group requests to be heard at that next
                  meeting.
                  e.
                  Any person speaking on an issue at a city council meeting shall not be allowed to speak for longer than five
                  minutes on the issue in question. Provided, however, that any person speaking on an issue may continue to
                  answer any questions by any city council member or the mayor.
                  f.
                  Any group of persons who wishes to be heard by the council on any particular issue shall collectively be limited
                  to a speaking period of not more than 20 minutes regardless of the number of individuals wishing to speak on
                  that issue. Provided, however, that if a group of people wishes to speak for and another group of people wishes to
                  speak against a certain issue, then each side shall be allowed to speak for no more than 20 minutes. Provided,
                  further, that no one individual shall be allowed to speak for more than five minutes on any given issue unless said
                  individual is giving an answer to a question presented by the mayor of a member of the city council.
                  (6)
                  The mayor, or the mayor pro tem in the mayor's absence, shall be allowed to deviate from the order of the agenda
                  established by the clerk due to the concerns of citizens who wish to speak on an issue and may further change the
                  order of the agenda for any other reason at his discretion.

                  Sec. 2-57. - Rules for enaction of ordinances.
                  (a)
                  All ordinances shall be introduced at a first reading at an official council meeting. Each ordinance shall be in
                  writing and in the form required for final adoption, except as otherwise provided herein.
                  (b)
                  The enacting clause on each ordinance shall be "The Council of the City of Ty Ty hereby ordains …," or such
                  similar enacting language which shall be in every ordinance.
                  (c)
                  Any councilmember may introduce any ordinance and said ordinance shall be read at a regular or special
                  meeting of the city council. The reading may be silent by each member of the council if so approved by the
                  council or waived by unanimous vote if the ordinance has been received and read by all members prior to the
                  meeting.

                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  46/321
                  Each ordinance shall be adopted or rejected by the city council in accordance with these rules.
                  (e)
                  No ordinance may be adopted on the same day that it is introduced, except for emergency ordinances, which
                  procedures must be complied with according to section 3.18 of the official Charter.
                  (f)
                  Even though the writing is required to be in the form for final adoption when presented at the meeting, the
                  following shall apply to any changes to the written form of the ordinance presented at the meeting for the first
                  reading:
                  (1)
                  Any clerical errors, any obvious errors in construction, and any corrections that are not material changes to the
                  ordinance may be made by having the same retyped before the final adoption of the ordinance without further
                  vote or approval by the council.
                  (2)
                  Material changes may be made to the ordinance at the first reading only by the council voting to change the
                  ordinance by a specific vote setting out the changes to the ordinance. Even though the writing itself will not be
                  officially changed until later, upon an affirmative vote by the council to approve the ordinance as amended at its
                  first reading, the ordinance will be deemed to meet the requirement of being in writing and in the form required
                  for the final adoption. Subsequent thereto, the city clerk and/or the city attorney may draft the exact language to
                  conform the writing to the amendments that were duly adopted by the council even though the same may not
                  have been reduced to writing at that time.
                  (3)
                  Regardless of the foregoing rules and procedures, any ordinance that is presented for a second and final reading
                  and is duly adopted and approved by the city council shall thereafter be considered a valid ordinance even
                  though the ordinance contains written modifications thereto if the ideas and concept of those modifications were
                  discussed at the first or a subsequent meeting and duly approved by the council. It is the intention of this section
                  that the adoption of any ordinance in its final form at a second reading shall cure any procedural or other
                  inadequacies related to said ordinance unless there is a manifest injustice created by the enaction of said
                  ordinance related to those changes since it is the intention of the council that any ordinance adopted on its final
                  reading should be presumed to be valid and should not be changed except in very rare and unusual
                  circumstances.

                  The purpose of sections 2-58 through 2-64 is to amend all previous ordinances and to establish the date and time
                  for the official regular city council monthly meetings of the city. In addition, these sections are to carry out the
                  purposes and intents of section 3.13 of the City Charter which requires the city council to hold regular scheduled
                  meetings at such times and places as prescribed by ordinance.

                  Since the first Monday of September each year is Labor Day and a national holiday, the regularly scheduled city
                  council meeting for the month of September shall be held on the Tuesday following the first Monday in
                  September.

                  In the event that any other national holiday, state holiday, or official observance occurs on the first Monday in a
                  month, the mayor at his discretion shall have the authority to move the city council meeting to the Tuesday
                  following the first Monday in that month; or if the mayor deems it inappropriate, then the meeting shall be
                  moved to the second Monday in the month to ensure that a quorum will be present at said meeting.

                  scheduled monthly city council meeting, then the mayor shall have the authority in advance to schedule the
                  regular monthly city council meeting for the day following the regularly scheduled meeting; or if it appears that
                  the circumstances are such that the meeting cannot be held at that time, then the meeting can be rescheduled for
                  the second Monday in the month at the discretion of the mayor, or in his absence the mayor pro tem.
                  (b)
                  In the event that a quorum does not appear for any regular monthly city council meeting, then the meeting shall
                  automatically be rescheduled for the day following the regular monthly city council meeting unless it appears
                  that a quorum will not be present at that time, in which event the presiding officer present at the meeting shall
                  reschedule the meeting for the next following Monday or at such other time as the presiding officer deems is the
                  most appropriate time for the meeting to be held if it does not appear that the next Monday is an appropriate time

                  those present at the meeting in which said meeting was continued.

                  shall have the authority to change the time of the meeting; but in no event shall any regular scheduled meeting
                  begin after 8:30 p.m. on any given night.

                  said meeting. In such event, the city clerk shall notify the councilmembers that the meeting has been cancelled.
                  Should the mayor or any councilmember decide that there is an issue that needs to be handled before the next
                  regularly scheduled monthly meeting, then and in that event, the mayor shall schedule a special called meeting at
                  a time when it appears that there would be a quorum at said meeting. Otherwise, there will be no need to make
                  up the regularly scheduled meeting that was cancelled.

                  within the fourth degree of civil reckoning to an existing city councilmember run for office and be elected to said
                  office by the citizens of the city, then said individual shall be permitted to serve on the city council with the other

                  Advertisements must be delivered personally or by mail. It shall be unlawful for any merchant or other person,
                  entity, or business by himself or his employees to place or deposit in the streets of the city or in any of the yards

                  Exception for property owners' subscriptions. Provided, however, that this chapter shall not apply to any
                  advertising matter or printed materials for which a resident, business, or landowner subscribes for the
                  distribution of said literature and if the owner or person entitled to possession of the property requests that said
                  material be delivered to that residence, then the material shall not be classified as litter. Any person, entity, or
                  business distributing such material upon request of the city shall provide a current list of subscribers in the city.
                  Any such distributor must update its list at least every six months. If false information is given to the city by
                  such distributor or should the distributor fail to maintain a current subscriber list, then it shall be considered a

                  of notice continues to distribute its materials, then each picture, bill, advertising matter, or printed material of any
                  kind that is distributed even to subscribers shall be considered litter and shall be a violation of this chapter. In
                  addition, any distributor shall be responsible for removal of unwanted material distributed, and failure to do so
                  shall be a violation of this chapter.

                  This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Alcoholic Beverage Ordinance."

                  this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
                  Alcoholic beverage means all alcohol meant for consumption, distilled spirits, beer, malt beverages, wine, or
                  fortified wine.
                  Distilled spirits, beer, malt beverages, wine, and fortified wine shall have the definitions as established by

                  This chapter and the restrictions contained herein are imposed and designed for the protection of the public
                  health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. It is the further purpose of this chapter to establish the
                  policy related to alcoholic beverages and their sale, use, and possession within the jurisdiction of the city. The
                  city council, after reviewing various articles and studies which the council deems to be sufficient, finds that there
                  is a great likelihood that the sale and use of alcoholic beverages in the city would cause an increase in crime,
                  destruction of property, and endangering the lives of its citizens.

                  Sec. 6-4. - Jurisdiction.

                  It is hereby deemed to be against the public policy of the citizens and government of the city for any person or
                  entity to sell alcoholic beverages in the city.
                  (Ord. No. 1998-1, § 5, 5-4-1998)

                  (2)
                  The city shall not issue any license nor shall it ever set any standard for issuing a license to sell any type of
                  alcoholic beverages in the city. Should any business that has a business license violate any provisions of this
                  chapter, then said business license to practice business in the city shall, upon a proper finding of such by any
                  court, be revoked, and said business shall not be reissued an occupation license or business license for a period
                  of at least one year thereafter.
                  (3)
                  It shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter for any minor who is under the legal age to possess or have
                  under his control any alcoholic beverage within the city limits, except for small amounts (less than one ounce in

                  (4)
                  It shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter for alcoholic beverages to be given to, turned over to,

                  container that is not sealed (i.e., that is in an open container) while said person is on a street, in any other public
                  place, or in any business establishment that is open to the public within the city limits.

                  assigned to it under the system of numbering in the city shall display such number in compliance with the
                  requirements of this article. Mobile home parks and apartment complexes, including duplex dwelling structures,
                  shall also be required to have each individual lot number or apartment number displayed in a readily visible
                  manner and in compliance with this article. All numbers for a lot in a mobile home park, apartments, and
                  buildings located along a street shall be in sequence unless approved otherwise in writing by the city council.

                  Sec. 10-73. - Method.
                  Street address numbers shall be prominently displayed as follows:
                  (1)
                  In cooperation with the county and at the request of the 911 emergency services, the city has obtained metal
                  stakes with reflecting numbers for each building and lot wherein lot numbers have been established under the
                  city's uniform house numbering plan as shown on the official chart and records of the city as of the end of
                  March, 2004. The city will install said house numbers on each lot in such place, either on the road right of way
                  or on the property of an owner, as the city deems most appropriate. In general the city will, but is not required to,
                  place the metal stake containing the number on the right of way generally centered in front of any house located
                  on the property. Each mobile home park shall have a number for the park located next to the road, but each lot
                  shall have a separate number generally located next to the water meter.
                  (2)
                  After the initial placement of the metal stakes containing the numbers on each lot in the city, any additional lots
                  that are created that shall have a structure located thereon shall require a metal stake with a number as set out for
                  other lots on that same street or area. Any lot that has the metal stake removed or severely damaged shall be
                  replaced within ten days. The owner and occupant of each building required to have a number shall pay for a
                  new stake with the appropriate number located thereon, the same to be obtained through the city, and shall pay to
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  60/321
                  the city an installation fee plus the cost of the materials. Such fee shall be established from time to time by the
                  city council and made available for examination at city hall. The city personnel shall thereafter install such new
                  number in the appropriate location as established by the city. Any new stakes may be metal or of such other
                  material as selected by the city.
                  (3)
                  The numbers shall be posted in English using Arabic (not Roman) numerals. The numbers shall be a minimum
                  of three inches in height and shall be metal or such other material as approved by the city. Only the official stakes
                  supplied by the city may be used unless another is approved or authorized by either the mayor or the
                  maintenance superintendent of the city.

                  No person, unless properly authorized by the city, shall remove or otherwise disturb any house number. All
                  numbers, even those subsequently paid for by a property owner, shall be the property of the city. The property
                  owner and occupant shall be held responsible for and shall reimburse the city for the loss or theft of any stake or
                  house number.

                  No person shall place upon or about any house number any object, material, debris, or structure of any kind, nor
                  shall the occupant allow any vegetation to grow up around any house number that shall prevent the number from
                  being readily visible from the public street if the lot is located on a street or the roadway if the lot is located in a
                  mobile home park. Shrubs, bushes, and flower beds must be trimmed to allow the house number to be easily seen
                  by any emergency vehicle attempting to locate said property.

                  Sec. 10-76. - Record of numbers.
                  The city shall keep a chart showing proper street numbers and shall assign to every lot the proper number by
                  which a building is to be designated. The failure of the city to keep such a chart current, however, shall not
                  prevent any lot owner from making sure that his house number is in place and visible at all times.

                  Sec. 10-77. - Obligation of owner.
                  The obligation of complying with all of the provisions of this article shall be upon the owner of the property. The
                  owner may designate an occupier of the property to take care of the requirements, but it is the property owner
                  that is ultimately responsible and who will be prosecuted by the city if a violation occurs. Upon such violation,
                  notice shall be given to the owner of the property or his agent specifying the particulars of the violation and
                  requiring that such violation be brought into compliance with this article within ten calendar days upon receipt of
                  such notice. Any adult occupying the property shall be considered an agent of the owner. Failure to comply
                  within the ten calendar days shall be punishable, upon conviction, as hereinafter provided.

                  practitioner in accordance with the terms of a contract or agreement with another business which recruits such
                  individual is an employee of the business or practitioner which issues to such individual for purposes of

                  (1)
                  The term "flea market" means any event:
                  a.
                  At which two or more persons offer personal property for sale or exchange; and
                  b.
                  At which a fee is charged for the privilege of offering or displaying personal property for sale or exchange; or
                  c.
                  At which a fee is charged to prospective buyers for admission to the area where personal property is offered or
                  displayed for sale or exchange; or
                  d.

                  62/321
                  Regardless of the number of persons offering or displaying personal property or the absence of fees, at which
                  used personal property is offered or displayed for sale or exchange if the event is held more than six times in any
                  12-month period.
                  (2)
                  The term "flea market" is interchangeable with and applicable to "swap meet," "indoor swap meet," or other
                  similar terms regardless of whether these events are held inside a building or outside in the open. The primary
                  characteristic is that these activities involve a series of sales sufficient in number, scope, and character to
                  constitute a regular course of business.
                  (3)

                  admission fee or parking fee charged vendors or prospective purchasers or the gross receipts or net earnings from
                  the sale or exchange of personal property, whether in the form of a percentage of the receipts or earnings, as
                  salary, or otherwise, inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or person participating in the organization or
                  conduct of the event; or
                  b.
                  Any event at which all of the personal property offered for sale or displayed is new, and all persons selling,
                  exchanging, or offering or displaying personal property for sale or exchange are manufacturers or licensed retail
                  or wholesale merchants.

                  Occupation tax means a tax levied on persons, partnerships, corporations, or other entities for engaging in an
                  occupation, profession, or business for revenue-raising purposes.
                  Person shall be held to include all sole proprietors, corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, or any
                  other form of business organization. However, for purposes of the occupation tax, any charitable nonprofit
                  organization which utilizes at least 50 percent of its gross income for charitable or religious purposes shall not
                  have to pay occupational taxes. The charitable nonprofit organization has the burden of proof of convincing the
                  city that it utilizes at least 50 percent of its gross income for religious or charitable purposes.
                  Practitioner of profession or occupation means one who by state law requires state licensure regulating such
                  profession or occupation and shall not include a practitioner who is an employee of a business, if the business
                  pays an occupation tax.

                  for the initial start-up, renewal, or reopening of those accounts. The amount of the administrative fee shall be as

                  An occupation tax shall be levied upon those businesses and practitioners of professions and occupations within
                  the city limits based upon the number of employees of the business or practitioner. The tax rate determined by

                  every calendar month of the preceding calendar year, and the occupation tax shall be based upon that number of
                  employees. For example, if a business has only 50 employees from January through November but employs 101
                  employees during December, then the business must pay an occupation tax at the rate required for 101
                  employees.

                  Each business shall pay to the city the occupation tax provided herein unless otherwise specifically provided
                  herein. Said occupation tax shall be payable on January 1 of each year, and if not paid by January 31 of that year,
                  each business shall incur interest on delinquent occupation taxes and administrative fees at a rate of 1.5 percent
                  per month. Should any occupation tax or license fee remain due and unpaid for 90 days from the due date, the
                  person liable for the tax or fee shall be subject to and shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the tax or fee due, said
                  penalty to be in addition to the occupation tax.
                  (b)
                  Should any person or business covered hereunder fail to file the registration as required by section 12-23 by
                  January 31 of any calendar year, then the occupation tax for that business shall conclusively be presumed to be
                  for the highest rate listed in the schedule of rates, regardless of the number of employees employed by said
                  business.

                  On any new profession, trade, or business the administrative fee required by section 12-21 and the occupation
                  tax shall be delinquent if not obtained and paid within 30 days following the commencement of the business.
                  Any new business commenced on or after July 1 in any year shall pay an occupation tax for the remaining
                  portion of the year at a rate of 50 percent of the tax imposed for the entire year. Failure of any new business to
                  register or pay the administrative fee or pay the occupation tax within 30 days following the commencement of
                  the business shall result in said business being in a delinquent status.
                  (d)
                  Any business that was in existence prior to January 1 of any calendar year and which fails to register or pay any
                  fees required by this article by January 31 of that year shall result in said business being in a delinquent status.
                  (e)
                  The registration required in section 12-23 shall be accepted by the city clerk if the registration is in proper form
                  and filed appropriately. If any person whose duty it is to file a registration or pay any fees required herein shall,
                  after becoming delinquent, transact or offer to transact business in the city, then said person shall incur an
                  additional penalty that has been set previously by city council per day for each day that said person is delinquent.
                  Each calendar day of such violation shall constitute a separate violation of this article. The maximum penalty
                  shall not exceed the last amount set by city council prior to such violation (if no amount has been set, then the
                  maximum penalty shall not exceed $1,000.00). The penalty shall automatically be assessed for each day that the
                  registration has not been filed and/or any portion of the fees and penalties are not paid after becoming delinquent.
                  (f)
                  The city may proceed to collect any amounts owed under this article in the same manner as provided by law for
                  tax executions. In addition, the city may place a lien in the superior court clerk's office of the county against any
                  and all property of the owner of said business in the county in the full amount of any administrative fee,
                  occupation tax, penalty assessed herein, as well as a reasonable fee for obtaining said lien, including any actual
                  attorney's fees charged by the city attorney, plus the cost for obtaining and filing said lien.
                  (g)
                  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require an attorney to pay the occupation tax or otherwise register
                  with the city as a precondition to the practice of law.

                  Sec. 12-111. - Purpose.
                  The city council finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to
                  enact regulations to reduce the possible adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. However, the city
                  council also finds that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon protected
                  forms of expression. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to reasonably regulate adult entertainment
                  establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate governmental interest of reducing criminal activity and
                  protecting property values without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of adult entertainment
                  establishments and their patrons.

                  Sec. 12-112. - License required.
                  It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in, conduct or carry on, in or upon any premises within the city, an
                  adult entertainment establishment without a valid adult entertainment license to do so. The issuance of such
                  license shall not be deemed to authorize, condone, or make legal any activity or conduct that is illegal or
                  unlawful under the laws of the state or the United States. The annual license fee for an adult entertainment
                  establishment shall be established from time to time by resolution of the city council.

                  Sec. 12-113. - On-premises operator required.
                  An adult entertainment establishment shall have a designated person to serve as an on-premises operator. The
                  operator shall be principally in charge of the establishment and shall be located on the premises during operating
                  hours.

                  (1)
                  A licensee gave false or misleading information in the application or renewal process.
                  (2)
                  A licensee knowingly allowed possession, use, or sale of controlled substances on the premises, or the licensee
                  did not make a reasonable effort to prevent such occurrence.
                  (3)
                  A licensee violated or knowingly allowed violation of this adult entertainment establishment article, any
                  ordinance of the city, or any criminal law of the state to occur on the premises, or the licensee did not make a
                  reasonable effort to prevent such violation.
                  (4)
                  A licensee has been convicted of any drug-related, alcohol-related, or sex-related crime by the state or city
                  regarding any offense which was committed on the premises, or which would otherwise violate the provisions of
                  this article.
                  (5)
                  A licensee failed to pay any fee, license fee, fine or other amount of money due to the city under this article or
                  any ordinance of the city.
                  (c)
                  In the event that the mayor determines that a license violation has occurred, such license shall be suspended for

                  all subsequent violation, the license shall be suspended for 90 days. Any license that has been suspended three or

                  the licensee upon appeal to the city council. The mayor's decision shall be final unless an appeal is timely filed.
                  An appeal shall stay the mayor's decision until the appeal is heard or withdrawn. The mayor shall place the
                  appeal on the agenda of the next regular city council meeting occurring not less than five, nor more than 30 days

                  Set a hearing date before the city council and instruct the mayor to give such notice of hearing as may be
                  required by law; or
                  (2)
                  Appoint a hearing officer and fix the time and place for hearing. The hearing officer may or may not be a city
                  employee, and may be appointed for an extended period of time. The mayor shall assume responsibility for such
                  publication of notice of the hearing as may be required by law. If a hearing officer is appointed, the hearing shall
                  be conducted in accordance with the procedures set out in this article.
                  (f)
                  In either event, the hearing shall be held within 30 days of the city council's action, unless a continuance of such
                  date is agreed to by the licensee and the mayor.
                  (g)
                  At any hearing, the hearing officer (or the city council if a hearing officer is not appointed) shall receive oral and
                  written testimony regarding the appeal. Hearings shall be conducted under rules issued by the hearing officer or
                  city council, which shall be consistent with rules applied in administrative proceedings, and shall ensure that
                  each party may present evidence, cross examine witnesses, and be represented by legal counsel.
                  (h)
                  If the hearing is held before the city council, the council may sustain, overrule, or modify the action of the
                  mayor. Appeals from the decision of the city council shall be to the county superior court, and filed within 30
                  days of the city council's decision. The decision of the city council shall otherwise be final.
                  (i)
                  If the hearing is held before a hearing officer, the hearing officer shall, within a reasonable time not exceeding 15
                  days from the termination date of such hearing, submit a written report to the city council. Such report shall
                  contain a brief summary of the evidence considered, and state the findings, conclusions and recommendation.

                  shall be filed with the mayor, and shall be considered public record. A copy of such report shall be forwarded by
                  certified mail to the appellant on the same day it is filed with the mayor. An additional copy shall be furnished to
                  the county sheriff. The mayor shall place the hearing officer's report on the agenda of the next regular city
                  council meeting occurring not less than ten days after the report is filed. The mayor shall also notify the appellant
                  of the date of such meeting at least ten days prior to the meeting unless the appellant stipulates a shorter notice
                  period.
                  (j)
                  The city council may adopt or reject the hearing officer's decision in its entirety or may modify the proposed
                  recommendation. The city council shall base its determination on the hearing officer's report and other evidence
                  in the record. No additional evidence or arguments shall be permitted at the council meeting. If the council does
                  not adopt the hearing officer's recommendation, it may:
                  (1)
                  Refer the matter to the same or another hearing officer for a de novo hearing, or for the taking of additional
                  evidence on specific points, and in either of such cases the hearing officer shall proceed as provided in this
                  section; or
                  (2)
                  Decide the case upon a review of the entire record before the hearing officer, with or without taking additional
                  evidence.

                  The city council finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, and safety of the community to enact

                  structural erosion and sediment control practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or
                  outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures and sediment traps, etc. Such practices can be found in the
                  publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia.
                  Trout streams: All streams or portions of streams within the watershed as designated by the Wildlife Resources
                  Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources under the provisions of the Georgia Water Quality
                  Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20, in the rules and regulations for Water Quality Control, Chapter 391-3-6 at
                  www.gaepd.org. Streams designated as primary trout waters are defined as water supporting a self-sustaining
                  population of rainbow, brown or brook trout. Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which
                  there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction, but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First
                  order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs.

                  87/321
                  (1)
                  Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover; or
                  (2)
                  Temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or
                  (3)
                  Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass.
                  Such measures can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia.
                  Watercourse: Any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert,
                  drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has
                  a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of
                  overflow or floodwater.
                  Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration
                  sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically
                  adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar
                  areas.

                  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance
                  work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion;
                  (4)
                  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part
                  of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre
                  and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence
                  shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this subsection. For singlefamily residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between
                  the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia
                  Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the
                  residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks
                  of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance
                  to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal

                  use in the production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and
                  rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys; producing
                  plants, trees, fowl or animals, the production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock poultry, eggs and
                  apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds;
                  (6)
                  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry
                  practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in
                  subsection 12-22(c)(15) and (16), no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management
                  practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period
                  of three years after completion of such forestry practices;
                  (7)
                  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
                  of the United States Department of Agriculture;
                  (8)
                  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not
                  apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned
                  disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for
                  purposes of this paragraph, "state waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them only
                  during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them yearround; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which
                  involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way,
                  must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and
                  provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such
                  project which is not specifically exempted by subsection (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) or (10) of this section;
                  (9)
                  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the
                  department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road
                  construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that

                  (Ord. No. 2012-03, § III, 8-6-2012)
                  Sec. 14-22. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management
                  practices.
                  (a)
                  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing
                  activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those
                  land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into
                  the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control
                  measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
                  The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility
                  installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to
                  prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in
                  accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
                  (b)
                  Minimum requirements/BMPs.
                  (1)
                  Best management practices, as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, shall be required for all landdisturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a
                  complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2)
                  or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to
                  O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper
                  design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained
                  in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
                  (2)
                  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly
                  designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  90/321
                  local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f),
                  the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of
                  receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm
                  water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The
                  turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director.
                  This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes
                  which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such
                  construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
                  (3)
                  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any landdisturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division
                  pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure
                  occurs.
                  (4)
                  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent
                  monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
                  (5)
                  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of
                  O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
                  (c)
                  [Erosion and sedimentation prevention.] The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant
                  to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum,
                  protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound
                  conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are
                  consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment
                  Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the
                  year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
                  (1)
                  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to
                  minimize erosion;
                  (2)
                  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)
                  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion
                  potential;
                  (4)
                  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  91/321
                  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
                  (6)
                  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)
                  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
                  (8)
                  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
                  (9)
                  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins,
                  silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is
                  stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-
                  1 et seq.;
                  (10)
                  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or
                  the sloping of fills;
                  (11)
                  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  (12)
                  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect
                  other property owners;
                  (13)
                  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are
                  not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
                  (14)
                  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for
                  treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments
                  on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 14-22(b)(2) of this
                  article;
                  (15)
                  Except as provided in subsection (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of
                  all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream
                  flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of
                  natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8,
                  where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion
                  control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any
                  ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  92/321
                  circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the
                  channel located above the ground-ater table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for
                  which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral
                  stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the
                  "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as
                  provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
                  a.
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the
                  final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective
                  vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient
                  quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family
                  residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy,
                  may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water
                  quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
                  b.
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as
                  measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of
                  disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated
                  into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream
                  crossings for sewer lines; and
                  (16)
                  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested
                  by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant
                  to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage
                  structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams
                  which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may
                  be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance
                  promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the
                  landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a
                  variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are
                  incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply
                  to such buffer:
                  a.
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once
                  the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a
                  protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in
                  sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a singlefamily residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own
                  occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to
                  protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the
                  stream bed; and
                  b.

                  93/321
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as
                  measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream cause a width of
                  disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated
                  into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream
                  crossings for sewer lines.
                  (d)
                  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and
                  regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum
                  requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
                  (e)
                  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of
                  another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in
                  this article or the terms of the permit.

                  94/321
                  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided
                  that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and
                  paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity
                  included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to
                  issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of
                  such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is
                  required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) and (10) shall be submitted in full to the division,
                  regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
                  (4)
                  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the
                  application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days
                  of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The
                  results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the
                  plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 14-22(c)(15) and (16) have
                  been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 14-23(b)(6), have been
                  obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an
                  agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without
                  referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall
                  approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority
                  with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.

                  Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration,
                  the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
                  (6)
                  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security,
                  cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or
                  fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not
                  comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call
                  the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of
                  the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect
                  an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the
                  local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.

                  local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where
                  necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions
                  under which the activity may be undertaken.
                  (2)
                  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control
                  plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is
                  in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 14-22(c)(15) and (16) are obtained,
                  bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 14-23(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and
                  regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is
                  denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
                  (3)
                  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this
                  article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division
                  shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority.
                  (4)
                  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.
                  (5)
                  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the
                  land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the
                  approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this
                  article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected
                  by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit.
                  (6)

                  (a)
                  The Tifton Tift County Development Support Services will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing
                  activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance
                  with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation.
                  Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are
                  defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of
                  best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary
                  permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the
                  secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for
                  installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through
                  inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply
                  with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply
                  shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and
                  shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing
                  activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.
                  (b)
                  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any
                  amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
                  (c)
                  The Tifton Tift County Development Support Services shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it
                  may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at
                  reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of
                  land-disturbing activities.
                  (d)
                  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the
                  commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents
                  appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in
                  the process of carrying out his official duties.
                  (e)
                  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities
                  which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the
                  commission, or both, may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of
                  improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control
                  program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any
                  deficient or ineffective local program is found.
                  (f)
                  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as
                  local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to,
                  review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance
                  with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the
                  governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not
                  administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement

                  municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days
                  within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the
                  county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division,
                  the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is
                  not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring
                  that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided,
                  however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the landdisturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing
                  authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning.
                  (2)
                  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate
                  stop-work order.
                  (3)
                  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary
                  corrective action or mitigation has occurred.
                  (4)
                  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant
                  amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have
                  been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly
                  designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the
                  director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall
                  be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to
                  all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or
                  permanent erosion and sediment controls.
                  (c)
                  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has
                  failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  98/321
                  shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which
                  such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within
                  the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be
                  deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 14-
                  23(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the
                  proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
                  (d)
                  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation
                  established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or
                  emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed
                  $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article notwithstanding any provisions in
                  any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00
                  for each violation, Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of

                  violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose
                  penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or
                  failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing
                  activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational
                  requirements specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational

                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the
                  construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a
                  minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final side grading or pouring of concrete
                  pads) is completed before January 7, 1985.
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the
                  construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the

                  facilities, structures and their contents.
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
                  order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
                  designated height.
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the purposes of floodplain
                  management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
                  greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge
                  openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent

                  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or floodresistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a
                  basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the
                  structure in violation of other provisions of this code.
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and
                  designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term

                  establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a
                  community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for
                  establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of
                  construction commenced after the FIRM date and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
                  floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start construction
                  commenced after January 7, 1985, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the
                  construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a
                  minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
                  concrete pads) is completed after the FIRM date.
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing
                  and future FEMA flood modernization maps.
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is:

                  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
                  (4)
                  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational,
                  camping, travel, or seasonal use.
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of
                  construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
                  means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footing,
                  installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the
                  placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land
                  preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways;
                  nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
                  nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as
                  garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not
                  exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means
                  the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration
                  affects the external dimensions of the building.
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or
                  liquid storage tank.
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development.
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
                  structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
                  before the damage occurred.
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure,
                  taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market
                  value of the structure prior the start of construction of the improvement. (Note: The market value of the structure
                  should be (i) the appraised value ot the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (ii) in
                  the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which
                  have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of
                  this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
                  ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the
                  external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (i) those improvements of a structure
                  required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which
                  are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement
                  official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (ii) any alteration of a historic structure
                  provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction,
                  rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the
                  streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner
                  otherwise prohibited by this chapter.
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's
                  floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other
                  certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such
                  time as that documentation is provided.

                  Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or with any of its requirements, including conditions and
                  safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a violation.
                  Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction
                  thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than 90 days, or both, but this punishment
                  section shall automatically be amended when the current codification of the city ordinances is completed and

                  Sec. 16-21. - Purpose.
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public
                  and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
                  (1)
                  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood
                  damage at the time of initial construction;
                  (2)
                  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or
                  which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
                  (3)
                  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
                  (4)
                  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
                  increase flood hazards to other lands; and
                  (5)
                  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved
                  in the accommodation of floodwaters.
                  (Ord. of 8-3-1998, art. 1, § C; Ord. No. 2010-01, art. 1, § C, 8-2-2010)
                  Sec. 16-22. - Statutory authorization.
                  Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units
                  to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore,
                  the city council does ordain the findings and objectives which follow.
                  (Ord. of 8-3-1998, art. 1, § A; Ord. No. 2010-01, art. 1, § A, 8-2-2010)

                  108/321
                  (a)
                  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
                  health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures
                  for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
                  safety and general welfare.
                  (b)
                  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are
                  inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect
                  of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
                  (Ord. of 8-3-1998, art. 1, § B; Ord. No. 2010-01, art. 1, § B, 8-2-2010)

                  (1)
                  To protect human life and health;
                  (2)
                  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer
                  lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
                  (3)
                  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a
                  manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
                  (4)
                  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
                  (5)
                  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the
                  expense of the general public;
                  (6)
                  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and

                  insurance study (FIS), dated September 29, 2010, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any
                  revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this chapter.
                  (b)
                  For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS dated September
                  29, 2010, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, for Tift County is hereby
                  adopted by reference.
                  (c)
                  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through
                  standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS.
                  (d)
                  The repository for public inspection of the flood insurance study (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting
                  data is located in the city offices.

                  113/321
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
                  (1)
                  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
                  collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
                  (2)
                  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and
                  utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
                  (3)
                  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and
                  practices that minimize flood damage;
                  (4)
                  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully
                  enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so
                  as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood
                  forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
                  a.
                  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or
                  meet the following minimum criteria:
                  1.
                  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot
                  of enclosed area subject to flooding;
                  2.
                  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  3.
                  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the
                  automatic flow of floodwater in both direction;
                  b.
                  So as not to violate the lowest-floor criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only
                  be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises,
                  or entry to the elevated area; and
                  c.
                  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.

                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
                  plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
                  accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
                  (6)
                  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring
                  may include, but are not limited to use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
                  addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces.
                  (7)
                  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
                  into the system;
                  (8)
                  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
                  floodwaters into the system and discharges from the systems into floodwaters;
                  (9)
                  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination
                  from them during flooding; and
                  (10)
                  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions
                  of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  115/321
                  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A
                  1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility
                  and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls
                  substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting
                  hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
                  shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice
                  for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in
                  section 16-53(6).
                  (3)
                  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
                  a.
                  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on (i) individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new and/or
                  substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured
                  home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a
                  manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including
                  basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
                  b.
                  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
                  may be elevated so that either:
                  1.
                  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood
                  elevation; or
                  2.
                  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at

                  (4)
                  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-26 are areas designated as
                  floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion
                  potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base
                  flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
                  a.
                  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other
                  development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is
                  demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering
                  practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base
                  flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification
                  thereof.
                  b.
                  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall
                  comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

                  Sec. 16-82. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (Azones).
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-26, where streams exist but no base
                  flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not
                  been delineated, the following provisions apply:
                  (1)
                  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have been provided in accordance with section 16-26, then the
                  administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and
                  floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this
                  division. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions in subsections (2) and
                  (3) of this section shall apply:
                  (2)
                  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the
                  stream or twenty feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a
                  registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result n more than a
                  one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
                  (3)
                  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements
                  of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no
                  less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be
                  elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been
                  completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
                  accordance with standards of section 16-80(4), elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment

                  without designated floodways.
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-26 where streams with base flood
                  elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated (zone AE), the following provisions apply:
                  (1)
                  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within
                  areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstration
                  that the cumulative effects of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
                  development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point
                  within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms the
                  standard hydraulic engineering principals.
                  (2)
                  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations
                  established in accordance with section 16-81

                  Sec. 16-84. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones).
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-26 may include designated AO shallow flooding areas.
                  These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The
                  following provisions apply:
                  (1)
                  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the
                  lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map
                  (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including
                  basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate
                  the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-80(4),
                  elevated buildings. The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a
                  permanent part of the permit file.
                  (2)
                  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of
                  elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight
                  to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially
                  impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic
                  and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
                  that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standard of practice for meeting the

                  (a)
                  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
                  (b)
                  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
                  electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
                  (c)

                  119/321
                  The board appointed for the purpose of hearing variance appeals as established by Tift County (hereafter referred
                  to as the "board") shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variances from the requirements of this chapter so
                  long as a cooperative agreement exists with Tift County.
                  (b)
                  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or
                  determination is made by the administrator or administrator's agents in the enforcement or administration of this
                  chapter.
                  (c)
                  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Tift, as
                  provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
                  (d)
                  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the
                  proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
                  the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
                  (e)
                  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided
                  the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods
                  that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
                  (f)
                  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
                  discharge would result.
                  (g)
                  In reviewing such requests, the board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards
                  specified in this and other sections of this chapter.

                  Conditions for variances.
                  (1)
                  A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  a.
                  A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.
                  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
                  c.
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  120/321
                  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
                  public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
                  conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
                  (2)
                  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the
                  standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
                  minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a
                  determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of
                  the building.
                  (3)
                  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the
                  base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance
                  will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor
                  elevation.
                  (4)
                  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal
                  Emergency Management Agency upon request.
                  (i)
                  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board may attach such
                  conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  (a)
                  Upon any complaint by any occupant of a building that is furnished water by the city concerning the quality of
                  water being furnished to said building, the city will at its own expense take a sample of the water and have it
                  tested to ensure that the quality of the water is fit for drinking purposes as required by state and federal law. The
                  city must be given permission by the owner or resident of the building to take its own sample. No sample will be
                  tested unless the sample is obtained by an employee or agent of the city.
                  (b)
                  Once the city tests the water going to a particular location, if the test shows that the water is fit for human
                  consumption within the parameters set by state and federal law, the city will not pay for any additional tests at
                  said location for a period of 12 consecutive months thereafter.
                  (c)
                  Provided, however, that any occupier of property in the city who is supplied water may request a second testing
                  during the period stated in subsection (b) of this section during which the city will not pay for such testing,
                  provided that the occupant pays in advance to the city any anticipated charges by the testing service as well as a
                  fee to the city for obtaining the water sample and sending it off to the testing service. The fee shall be as
                  established from time to time by the city council and made available for examination at city hall. Once this
                  nonrefundable fee is paid to the city, the city will then have the water tested on behalf of the occupant.
                  (d)
                  The city will take any and all steps necessary to correct any water problem as required by state and federal law
                  should the test show up positive for bacteria and other substances which are not acceptable by state or federal
                  law. Provided, however, that should the cost of repairing the water system be prohibitive, the city at its option
                  may terminate water services to its citizens in the affected area. Nothing contained in this article shall require the
                  city to correct any problem with the water supply that is caused by some condition from the meter to the
                  complaining occupant's building.
                  (e)
                  The city shall at all times have the right to shut down the supply of water to any building in which a
                  contamination exists during the entire period of contamination until the problem is corrected.

                  are not limited to the following activities:
                  (1)
                  Placing, keeping, maintaining, or otherwise allowing old cars, appliances, furniture, or other types of material or
                  debris on any parcel of land located within the city.
                  (2)
                  Playing loud music.
                  (3)
                  Public fighting.
                  (4)
                  Public yelling or screaming.
                  (5)
                  Loud gatherings in public which disturb neighbors.
                  (6)
                  Shouting obscenities.
                  (7)
                  Constantly honking horns or other devices that cause loud noises.
                  The fact that an act done may otherwise be lawful shall not keep it from being a nuisance. The inconvenience
                  complained of shall not be fanciful, or such as would affect only one of fastidious taste, but it shall be such as
                  would affect an ordinary, reasonable person.
                  (b)
                  Failure to abate a nuisance upon notice. Any person maintaining or causing to be maintained a nuisance on their
                  property or elsewhere in the city shall, upon notice being given by the mayor and/or the city council,
                  immediately abate such nuisance, and in no event shall the nuisance be allowed to continue in excess of 30 days
                  from the date of the receipt of notice by the violator. Upon failure to abate the nuisance, the violator shall be
                  cited to appear at the municipal court, which shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the question of the
                  existence of such nuisance and, if found to exist, to order its abatement. Upon the municipal court finding that a
                  nuisance exists and ordering its abatement, any person failing and refusing to abate such nuisance within 30 days
                  from the date of the order issued by the municipal court shall be guilty of a violation of this section.

                  Abatement of nuisance. The city shall have the right, upon the failure and refusal of any person to abate a
                  nuisance after that person has been ordered to do so by the municipal court, to abate the nuisance, and should
                  there be expenses attending such abatement, the city shall have the right to assess the expenses against the person
                  so offending. The city shall have the right to issue an execution against such person for said expenses, which
                  execution shall constitute a lien against the property of such person. The levy and sale of said property shall be
                  had in accordance with the law governing execution sales for cities in the state. If any property is removed by the
                  city pursuant to this section, the owner of said property shall automatically forfeit his rights to said property and
                  title and ownership shall thereafter be vested in the city.

                  (4)

                  It shall be unlawful to:

                  It shall be unlawful to cause or allow charred or burned debris of any kind including, but not limited to, charred
                  or burned household furnishings, furniture, mobile homes, burned buildings, or other structures to remain on any
                  property located within the city for an unreasonable length of time. It shall be conclusively presumed that burned
                  debris located on the property after 30 days from the date that it was burned is an unreasonable length of time.
                  Provided, however, that when any buildings or structures have been burned and the state fire marshal or other
                  investigators are making inspections concerning the fire, the owner or the occupant of the property shall have 30
                  days from the date that the fire marshal or other investigators terminate their investigation to clean up said
                  burned debris. Upon receipt of a notice from an employee of the city to clean up any burned debris, the owner or
                  occupant of the property shall have 30 days to either clean up the debris or obtain a written statement from the
                  state fire marshal or other investigator that the investigation is still pending in and to the fire that was the cause of

                  having made claim thereto; or
                  (5)

                  presented to the city council in a timely manner so that the decision can be made prior to 30 days before the
                  event is to occur.

                  liability herein, and if so, a copy of such insurance shall name the city as a loss payee; and a copy of such policy
                  shall be presented to the clerk prior to the event occurring. It shall be the responsibility of the sponsor to collect

                  termination of such event.

                  from which this chapter is derived, unless such street corresponds to the street location shown on an approved
                  subdivision plat or the major thoroughfare plan; provided that the mayor and council may accept, lay out, open,
                  and improve any street not so platted if it first submits such proposed action to the planning commission for its
                  review and comment and approves the same as an amendment to the major thoroughfare plan. Developers of
                  subdivisions will be solely responsible for acquiring all rights-of-way so that in the event that the city needs to
                  perform maintenance, rights-of-way will be in place.

                  property owner may petition the planning commission for a variance, and where the planning commission
                  concurs, it will prepare and send to the mayor and council a recommendation for a variance when considered
                  necessary and equitable. In case the planning commission fails to concur, the property owner may appeal to the
                  mayor and council for relief. All variance requests will require a public hearing in the same manner as an
                  amendment to the city's zoning ordinance. None of the items listed in article V of this chapter shall be subject to
                  variance.

                  Purpose. The purpose of the preliminary plat is to safeguard the subdivider from unnecessary loss of time and
                  expense in preparation of a subdivision plat which does not conform with the specifications of the subdivision
                  ordinance. The preliminary plat requires only approximate accuracy of scale and dimension. Public agencies
                  having jurisdiction will review preliminary plats regarding matters within their jurisdiction. During the review
                  process, the subdivider or his agent may be called upon for consultation.
                  (b)
                  Subdivisions requiring no new street, water, or sewer facilities. All subdivisions which do not involve the

                  preliminary plat accompanied by a letter of application. The letter of application will describe the proposed
                  subdivision at length and will also state for what purposes easements may be utilized for such as water, streets,
                  power or telecommunications maintenance. There will not be any restrictions on the use of easements. The letter
                  of application shall contain the name and address of the developer and his agent, the zoning of the property to be
                  subdivided, whether or not the subdivision will be developed in phases, plans for annexation, and plans for
                  serving the proposed subdivision with sewer and water facilities. The plat shall be prepared in accordance with
                  this chapter and with applicable city specifications by a registered land surveyor, who is licensed under the laws
                  of the state. The preliminary plat shall be deemed filed with the planning commission when it is filed with the
                  city zoning administrator. At the time of filing, a certificate of filing shall be provided to the subdivider and shall
                  include the time and date of filing. The zoning administrator shall have authority to reject the preliminary plat if
                  they find it does not comply with this chapter. If rejected, the zoning administrator shall provide the subdivider
                  with a written statement specifying all the respects in which the plat fails to comply. The subdivider may appeal
                  to the planning commission from such rejection. Filing of the preliminary plat shall be accomplished at least 30
                  days prior to the regular planning commission meeting at which it is to be considered. The preliminary plat shall
                  include:

                  Future tract plan. In cases where a subdivision is to be developed in stages with additional plats being filed with
                  the planning commission at a later date, the filing of the initial plat will be accompanied by future tract plan, a
                  reasonably accurate plat in sketch form of the entire tract which will show the future street system and
                  topography (quad sheets) for the entire tract. Once the required tract plan has been given approval by the
                  planning commission, five copies of the approved future tract plan must be provided for distribution to the
                  various reviewing agencies and the inspections office.
                  (8)
                  Wetlands. Approximate location of wetlands boundaries shall be delineated on the preliminary plat. All
                  preliminary plats delineating wetlands shall have on the face of said preliminary plat the note "No fill or work

                  wetlands boundaries within or contiguous to the project.
                  (d)
                  Completeness. If any of the information required in subsection (c) of this section is omitted or misrepresented on
                  the plat, the city zoning administrator may refuse to review the plat, and shall return the plat to the subdivider to
                  be completed or revised.
                  (e)
                  Approval by individual agencies. No preliminary plat shall be approved by the planning commission unless it is
                  approved by the staff development review committee. Said agencies shall, with or without modification, approve
                  or disapprove the preliminary plat to the extent that each has jurisdiction. If the plat is rejected, the respective
                  reviewing agency shall provide the planning commission with a written statement specifying all aspects where
                  the plat fails to comply.

                  164/321
                  review committee shall review the preliminary plat for technical compliance with the land subdivision ordinance,
                  zoning ordinance, comprehensive plan, and other city ordinances that might impact the proposed land
                  subdivision. The staff development review committee shall recommend in writing approval, conditional
                  approval, postponement or disapproval within 30 days of submission unless delayed for some justifiable reason.
                  (g)
                  Coordination. It shall be the zoning administrator's responsibility to ensure that the respective reviews of the

                  Review by planning commission. The planning commission shall review the preliminary plat, giving due
                  consideration to the review of the staff development review committee. The planning commission shall then

                  Preliminary approval means that the developer is now authorized to proceed with the preparation of the required
                  improvement plans, outlined in detail under section 28-80. No developer shall proceed with any construction or
                  any other work in the proposed subdivision before obtaining preliminary approval of these improvement plans in
                  writing. Lots shall not be sold nor shall building construction begin at this time. Preliminary approval grants the
                  developer a maximum time of 18 months within which he shall submit his improvements plan and final plat for
                  approval unless a time extension is granted by the planning commission before the expiration of the 18-month
                  period. If such time extension is granted, it shall be for not more than 12 additional months. Failure to submit
                  improvement plans and final plat within this time period, including extension if any, shall invalidate preliminary
                  plat approval, and require resubmission of preliminary plat. Additionally, if, in the opinion of the staff
                  development review committee, substantial changes have been made to the approved preliminary plat, the
                  revised plat shall be resubmitted as a new preliminary plat.
                  (2)
                  Conditional approval means the developer may proceed after written notice from the zoning administrator, as
                  outlined under preliminary approval but only after he has submitted at least five copies of the corrected
                  preliminary plan to the zoning administrator, noting thereon the condition or changes required by the approval of
                  the planning commission.
                  (3)
                  Postponement means action is delayed for specific reasons which shall be noted and transmitted in writing to the
                  developer by the zoning administrator. Postponed preliminary plans may be reconsidered by the planning
                  commission without resubmittal to the staff development review committee and the county health department.
                  (4)
                  Disapproval means denial of the application for subdivision because the developer's plans are not in compliance
                  with this chapter. For further consideration, the developer must rework and resubmit his plans as though they
                  were a completely new preliminary plan. The specific reasons for disapproval shall be stated to allow for
                  correction.
                  (Ord. No. 2000-2, § 4-1, 6-5-2000)

                  (a)
                  General requirements. Subdivision plats receive their second official consideration as improvement plans. These
                  plans shall be approved by the city engineer who shall certify that the improvement plans are in conformance
                  with this chapter, official city specifications, and with the requirements of the approved preliminary plan. No
                  developer shall proceed with any construction work in the proposed subdivision before obtaining this approval.
                  This process of improvement plans approval is between the city engineer and the developer, and is not subject to
                  planning commission review and approval.
                  (b)
                  Professional engineer consultant (if applicable) required. Should certain design calculations be required to
                  resolve flow problems, possible erosion or drainage problems, or other detailed design problems which might be
                  encountered in the process of preparing the required improvement plan, the city engineer shall be authorized to
                  require the services of a professional engineer or consultant in the improvement plan design process. Should
                  such services be required, such plans shall reflect the engineer or consultant's state registration. All professional
                  surveying, engineering or consultant service costs shall be the sole responsibility of the applicant.
                  (c)
                  Filing. To secure formal review of his improvement plans, the developer shall file with the zoning administrator
                  three certified white background prints of the improvement plans (signed and sealed by the developer's registered
                  consultant) white background prints of the improvement plans. The zoning administrator will then distribute the
                  improvements plan to the staff development review committee which shall jointly review the proposed
                  improvement plans and shall approve or deny the proposed improvement plans, The zoning administrator shall
                  notify the planning commission of the committee's action, in writing.
                  (1)
                  Approval. Approval means the developer is now authorized to proceed with the physical improvements in the
                  subdivision, after securing any required construction permits, and may proceed with the preparation of the final
                  subdivision plat.
                  (2)
                  Conditional approval. Conditional approval means the developer may proceed as outlined in the preceding
                  subsection, but only after he submits three certified copies of the corrected improvement plans to the city
                  engineer for his review and approval.
                  (3)
                  Denial. Denial means disapproval of the improvement plans. For further consideration, the developer must
                  rework his plans to conform to the requirements of this article, and then submit the reworked plans to the zoning
                  administrator as though they were a completely new set of plans.
                  (d)
                  Plans and data required for improvement plan submission.
                  (1)
                  Requirements. The plans for the required public improvements shall be prepared for the approval by the staff
                  development review committee prior to the construction and only after approval of the preliminary plat. Such
                  improvement plans shall show the proposed locations, sizes, types, grades and general design features of each
                  facility, and shall be based on reliable field data. Improvement plan approvals are good for 24 months. If the
                  subdivision is sold prior to completion and final platting, a mandatory review by the staff development review
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  166/321
                  committee shall be required. Failure to comply may result in revocation of construction permit after notice and
                  hearing before the planning commission. The developer shall receive a minimum of ten days' written notice of
                  said hearing.
                  (2)
                  Drawing. The improvement construction drawing shall be submitted on white background prints. The sheet size
                  shall be 24 inches by 36 inches unless another size is approved by the city engineer. The drawing shall include
                  the following information:

                  drainage shall be consistent with applicable city ordinances and other applicable governmental agencies. Water
                  and sewer systems shall be approved by the staff development review committee and all relevant state agencies.
                  The plat shall not be recorded until the developer submits to the zoning administrator all final permits required
                  for the construction of all improvements from other state, local or federal agencies.
                  d.
                  Utility service agreement. A developer's agreement for utilities service shall be required before the final
                  improvement plan approval is granted.
                  e.
                  Other public improvements. A plan shall be prepared for parks, recreation or other public use areas and
                  improvements if included in the approved preliminary plat.

                  and completed, including paving, and all utilities are in place and installed so that any individual lot owner can
                  hook on to such utility services immediately thereafter. All such improvements must be inspected and approval
                  given by the city engineer before any construction on a lot may begin.

                  Nonresidential. Blocks for other than residential use shall be of such length and width as may be suitable for
                  their prospective use including adequate provisions for off-street parking and maneuvering space.
                  (b)
                  Residential. The length of residential blocks shall not exceed 1,200 feet nor be less than 400 feet. Blocks of more
                  than 1,200 feet will be permitted if natural or manmade barriers such as streams and railroads require blocks of
                  greater size. The depth of residential blocks shall be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots, unless prohibited by
                  natural or manmade barriers, or unless one tier backs onto a line of another person's property, except as provided
                  for in section 28-117(d). The foregoing shall not prevent the inclusion of blocks of greater width and length,
                  when public use areas such as parks and playgrounds are included in the project design. These areas shall be
                  covered by adequate maintenance agreements if not dedicated and accepted for public maintenance.

                  Utility. Utility locations, where feasible, shall be located within the platted street right-of-way and if easements
                  are required, they shall be a minimum width of 20 feet. Where possible, as determined by the city engineer,
                  water lines shall be located on one side of the street and sewer lines shall be on the other side.
                  Telecommunications and electric lines may be located on the same side or opposite sides of the streets. Wherever
                  public utility easements are planned adjacent to the subdivision tract boundary or phase, they shall be platted
                  within said subdivision or phase thereof.
                  (b)
                  Drainage. No subdivision plat shall be accepted or approved unless it includes a hydrology plan and
                  sedimentation and soil erosion control plan certified by a professional engineer or registered land surveyor. The
                  plan shall provide a means of detaining storm and face water runoff on site, up to and including a 25-year flood
                  event, with such runoff to be released from the property at the same rate of flow that existed prior to the
                  development of property. The engineer or surveyor shall certify that the designed stormwater detention system
                  for the development will fully satisfy these provisions. The city engineer will verify the accuracy of the drainage
                  plans and may call upon the services of other design professionals for review at the expense of the developer
                  should onsite conditions warrant more detailed review. The developer is solely responsible for the accuracy of all
                  the submitted plans.

                  Minimum lot elevation. The lot area contained within and contiguous to the building walls and for minimum
                  distance of ten feet measured from all sides of said building shall have a minimum elevation of three feet above
                  the 100-year flood stage of streams or canals in particular area being developed based on acceptable engineering
                  procedure and approved by the city engineer. Said minimum elevation shall be subject to approval by the county
                  health department. A change in elevation necessary to meet this requirement will be permitted by filling within a
                  designated flood hazard zone, only if all other applicable permits are obtained prior to any fill work being done.
                  (1)

                  (c)
                  Corner lots. Corner lots shall be of such size and dimensions that will permit the location of buildings so as to
                  conform with the building setback lines as prescribed in the zoning appendix. Corner property lines at street
                  intersections shall have a minimum of a 30-foot deeded radius or a 30-foot permanent miter.
                  (d)
                  Double and reverse frontage. Lots having street frontage both to the front and rear shall be prohibited (unless
                  allowed by variance) except to provide for separation of residential development from railroad right-of-way or
                  arterial or collector street right-of-way. Where the aforementioned abuts or runs through any portion of the
                  subdivision, the subdivision plan shall provide for lots backing on said railroad or right-of-way, or arterial or
                  collector street right-of-way. All lots shall have a minimum depth adequate to provide for the rear yard setback
                  required by the respective zoning district, plus an additional 30 feet, ten feet of which shall be a planted,
                  nonencroachable buffer strip separating the lots from the right-of-way. The buffer zone shall be landscaped with
                  hedges or closely planted small trees to provide a visual screen and shall be planted at the time of development.
                  Said planted, nonencroachable buffer strip shall be clearly indicated on the final plat.

                  commercial and/or industrial area adjoins residential lots, or when a portion of a proposed subdivision adjoins an
                  area zoned for commercial or industrial use, a buffer zone not less than 20 feet in width shall be provided. Said
                  buffer strip shall be landscaped with hedges or closely planted small trees so as to provide visual screening. No
                  building or portion thereof may be constructed in said buffer zone. Said buffer zone shall be labeled as such on
                  the subdivision plat and shall be planted at the time of development and screening installed at the time of the
                  installation of the required minimum improvements.

                  right-of-way will not be accepted that is determined to be limiting the growth or traffic flow of an area.
                  (1)
                  Access. Every lot of every subdivision shall abut a public or an approved private street a minimum of 60 feet
                  which is or shall be maintained by the appropriate governing body. Where the subdivision does not immediately
                  adjoin a public street, the subdivider shall provide a public street from the subdivision to a public or private
                  street.

                  and continuation of or projection of existing public or private streets.
                  (3)
                  Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a right-of-way of not less than 160 feet
                  in diameter. Paving within the turnaround shall have an outside radius of not less than 70 feet. Temporary cul-desacs, approved by the planning commission, may be surfaced with gravel.
                  (4)
                  Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets and dead-end alleys shall be prohibited unless terminated with a cul-de-sac.

                  (9)
                  Right-of-way extension. Where the proposed subdivision abuts undeveloped properties, it is essential that
                  appropriate extensions of streets be left available to provide for future growth and development. Such street
                  rights-of-way to facilitate future development shall be extended by dedication and improved to the boundary of
                  the proposed subdivision.

                  or rights it has at law or in equity including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance, taking possession of the
                  facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way, prosecuting the violator, and/or any other remedy provided
                  by this Code or otherwise at law or in equity.

                  The registration statement shall remain in place for one year and renew each subsequent year automatically
                  unless the utility is in default. The director shall give written notice of default to a utility if it is determined that a
                  utility has:
                  (1)
                  Violated any provision or requirement of the issuance or acceptance of a registration application or any law of
                  the city, state, or federal government;
                  (2)
                  Attempted to evade any provision or requirement of this article;
                  (3)
                  Practiced any fraud or deceit upon the city; or
                  (4)
                  Made a material misrepresentation of fact in its application for registration.
                  (b)
                  If a utility fails to cure a default within 20 working days after such notice is provided to the utility by the city,
                  then such default shall be a material breach and the city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
                  equity to terminate the approval of the registration. If the director decides there is cause or reason to terminate,
                  the following procedure shall be followed:
                  (1)
                  The city shall serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow
                  a utility a minimum of 15 calendar days to cure its breach.
                  (2)
                  If the utility fails to cure within 15 calendar days, the city may declare the registration terminated.

                  The city, by issuing a written approval of registration under this article, does not surrender or to any extent lose,
                  waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or which may be hereafter vested in the
                  city under the Constitution and Laws of the United States, State of Georgia, and under the provisions of the city's
                  codified ordinances to regulate the use of the rights-of-way. The utility by applying for and being issued a written
                  approval of registration, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police
                  power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full
                  force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A utility is deemed to acknowledge
                  that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances
                  necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general
                  laws enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. In particular, all utilities shall comply with city zoning and
                  other land use requirements pertaining to the placement and specifications of facilities.

                  No utility shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this article by reason of any
                  failure of the city to enforce prompt compliance.

                  (1)
                  The rate schedule contemplates a single user, such as a one-family dwelling, one-farm dwelling with
                  appurtenances, or one commercial operation.
                  (2)
                  Extraordinary circumstances, such as subdivision extensions, multiple dwelling units, industrial users, and fire
                  protection shall be governed by special contract agreements made by the mayor and city council on
                  recommendation of the city engineer.

                  make a cash security deposit for water service and an additional deposit for sewer service if they are the owners
                  of the property. Upon request of water service to be provided by the city outside the city limits, the mayor and
                  city council shall have the right to decide if water service can be made available, at which time the consumer
                  shall make application for water service, in person, at the city hall, and at the same time make a cash security
                  deposit if the consumer is the property owner. Such deposits shall be as established from time to time by the city
                  council and set forth in the schedule of fees and charges, available for examination at city hall.

                  Each consumer subscribing to use the water and sewer service of the city shall pay a meter installation and
                  connection fee times the number of water connections desired for water service and a sewer tap fee times the
                  number of connections desired for sewer service. A reconnection fee shall be paid when connecting to any
                  existing sewer lines that are available. If the sewer service is disconnected for any reason an additional reconnect fee shall be paid. Such fees shall be as established from time to time by the city council and set forth in
                  the schedule of fees and charges, available for examination at city hall. Before water and sewer service is made
                  available to the consumer an inspection by a duly authorized agent for the city must be made.

                  The minimum charge, as provided in the rate schedule, shall be made for such connection subscribed for. Water
                  furnished for a given lot shall be used on that lot only and, except for fire protection, the city shall not under any
                  condition furnish water free of charge to anyone.

                  Sec. 32-245. - City's responsibility and liability.
                  The city shall run a service line from its distribution line to the property line where the distribution line exists or
                  is to be constructed, and runs immediately adjacent and parallel to the property to be served. No service charge,
                  other than the connection fee referred to in section 32-243, will be made for a five-eighths-inch by three-fourthsinch meter. A proportionately greater charge than the connection fee in section 32-243 will be made for a meter
                  of larger dimensions.
                  (1)
                  The city may make connections to service other properties not adjacent to its lines upon payment of reasonable
                  cost for the extensions of its distribution lines as may be required to render such service.

                  The city may install its meter at or near the property line or, at the city's option, on the consumer's property
                  within three feet of the property line.
                  (3)
                  The city reserves the right to refuse service unless the consumer's lines or pipings are installed in such a manner
                  as to prevent cross connections or backflow.
                  (4)

                  employees only. The consumer shall not sell water to any other person or permit any other person to use said
                  water. Water shall not be used for irrigation, fire protection, or other purposes, except when water is available in
                  sufficient quantity without interfering with the regular domestic consumption in the area served. Disregard for
                  this rule shall be sufficient cause for refusal and/or discontinuance of service.

                  (b)
                  Extensions to the system shall be made only when the consumer shall grant or convey, or shall cause to be
                  granted or conveyed, to the city a permanent easement of right-of-way across any property traversed by the water
                  and sewer lines.

                  departure or the time specified for departure, whichever period is longer. The new occupant shall apply for water
                  service within 48 hours after occupying the premises and failure to do so will make him liable for paying for the

                  Bills to customers for water and sewer service shall be mailed out on such days of each month as may be
                  determined by the city. Failure of the water and/or sewer users to pay charges duly imposed shall result in the
                  automatic imposition of the following penalties:

                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  199/321
                  Nonpayment within 20 days of the due date (the 20th day of the month) will be subject to a penalty of ten
                  percent of the delinquent account.
                  (2)
                  Nonpayment within 31 days of the due date or by the first day of the following month (for months with less than
                  31 days) will result in the water being shut off from the water user's property.
                  (3)
                  Nonpayment within 31 days will allow the city, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to terminate the
                  agreement, and in such event, the water user shall not be entitled to receive, nor the city obligated to supply, any
                  water under the agreement.
                  (4)
                  Water and sewer services shall not be reconnected until the customer's delinquent bill, including penalty, has
                  been paid in full. Should such customer or another customer at that same address thereafter desire to be
                  reconnected to the water and sewer system, the customer must pay a reconnection charge for water per meter or
                  per unit in addition to the entire past due bill, including penalty, before service will be reconnected. The
                  reconnection charge shall be as established from time to time by the city council and set forth in the schedule of
                  fees and charges, available for examination at city hall. Service will be reconnected only during regular business
                  hours which, for the purposes of this article, are from 9:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. on Monday and 9:00 a.m. until
                  5:00 p.m. on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. Any reconnection made other than during regular business hours
                  shall not be performed except as is provided in subsection (5) of this section.
                  (5)
                  No customer shall have the right to have services connected or reconnected other than during regular business
                  hours. Any connection or reconnection of services at any other time shall be performed solely at the discretion of
                  the city maintenance supervisor and only at such times as the city maintenance supervisor is willing and able to
                  perform such services. Before the city maintenance supervisor will connect or reconnect water after hours, the
                  customer must first pay any past due bill, including any penalty, pay the increased security deposit required in
                  section 32-250(1), pay the normal water reconnection charge, and in addition shall pay a after-hours reconnect
                  fee. The reconnection fees and charges shall be as established from time to time by the city council and set forth
                  in the schedule of fees and charges, available for examination at city hall. The customer shall take said funds to
                  city hall and drop said funds through the slot available for after-hours payment at city hall. The customer shall
                  then verbally inform the city maintenance supervisor that he has paid all such fees prior to the city maintenance
                  supervisor taking any steps to reconnect the water system. In the event that any part or all of the penalties, fees,
                  and past due bill are not paid by the customer prior to the city maintenance supervisor reconnecting the system,
                  then the city maintenance supervisor shall as soon as possible thereafter again disconnect the water system to
                  said customer; and an additional penalty as set by the city council shall be incurred for this action, and the
                  additional reconnect fees and all other penalties and charges shall be charged again before the system can be
                  reconnected.

                  When water and sewer service are discontinued and all bills paid, the security deposit shall be refunded to the
                  consumer by the city.

                  200/321
                  If service is disconnected for nonpayment of bills, then a security deposit in double the amount previously
                  required shall be paid to the city in order to have services reconnected. In the event that the security deposit has
                  not been applied to the past due bill as hereinafter provided, then a security deposit equal to that already held by
                  the city must be paid by the customer to have its services reconnected. This must be paid in addition to all other
                  service charges and penalties before service can be reconnected.
                  (2)
                  Upon discontinuance of service for nonpayment of bills, the security deposit will be applied first towards the
                  payment of any penalty and other fees as provided for herein; and the balance, if any, shall be applied towards
                  the past due account. Any balance will be refunded to the consumer. If the security deposit is insufficient to
                  cover the bill, the city may proceed to collect the balance in the usual way provided by law for the collection of
                  debts.
                  (3)
                  The city reserves the right to discontinue its service without notice for the following additional reasons:
                  a.
                  To prevent fraud or abuse.
                  b.
                  Consumer's willful disregard of the city's rules.
                  c.
                  Emergency repairs.
                  d.
                  Insufficiency of water supply due to circumstances beyond the city's control.

                  Any individual who pays a water meter deposit to obtain water services to a location and if on said system the
                  lock is cut off any water meter that has been placed thereon by the city or in any other way service is restored to
                  said location without the same being performed by the city maintenance supervisor or some other person
                  working for the city and the effect is that said location receive waters and said individual fails to report the same
                  to the city within 24 hours shall also be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall additionally be responsible for all
                  damages.
                  (6)
                  The city shall have the right to remove any water meter from any location that has had the city's lock removed or
                  in any other way said location has had water services restored to a system that has been cut off by the city. Such
                  action shall not affect or relieve any misdemeanor violations that may have occurred related to such water
                  service. Once a water meter is removed, before water services shall be restored to such a system, the applicant
                  will be required to pay a reinstatement fee, or the then-required fee as set by the city, whichever amount is
                  greater, as well as all unpaid balances owed at that location.

                  Should the city shut off services to a particular location, or should any person develop any scheme to obtain
                  water from the city's system without paying the city for such services, then before service may be reinstated to
                  that location, the applicant must pay a fee equal to double the amount that would have been charged by the city
                  had said water been obtained legally. such estimate shall be determined in any reasonable way by the city clerk
                  including, but not limited to, using the amount of water that was used in previous bills prior to service being
                  discontinued by the city, determining a per day rate, and then multiplying said rate times the number of days for
                  which the city believes that water was obtained illegally.

                  If the consumer believes his bill to be in error, he shall present his claim, in person, at the city hall before the bill
                  becomes delinquent. Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be effective in
                  preventing discontinuance of service as heretofore provided. The consumer may pay such bill under protest and
                  said payment shall not prejudice his claim.
                  (1)
                  The city will make a special water meter reading at the request of a consumer for a fee amounting to the actual
                  expenses incurred in making such a special meter reading, provided, however, that if such special reading
                  discloses that the meter was over-read, no charge will be made.
                  (2)
                  Water meters will be tested at the request of the consumer upon payment to the city of the actual costs of making
                  the test, provided, however, that if the meter is found to over-register beyond three percent of the correct volume,
                  no charge will be made.
                  (3)
                  If the seal of a meter is broken by other than the city's authorized representative or if the meter fails to register
                  correctly or is stopped for any cause, the consumer shall pay an amount estimated from the record of his previous
                  bills and/or from other proper data.

                  In interpreting and applying this ordinance, the requirements contained herein are declared to be the minimum
                  requirements necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance. Except as hereinafter provided, this ordinance
                  shall not be deemed to interfere with, abrogate, annul, or otherwise affect in any manner whatsoever any
                  easements, covenants, or otherwise agreements between parties. Whenever the provisions of this ordinance
                  impose greater restrictions upon the use of land or buildings, or upon the height of buildings, or require a larger
                  percentage of a lot to be left unoccupied than the provisions of other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, or
                  any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties, then the provisions of this ordinance shall
                  govern.
                  3-2. - Zoning affects all land and buildings.

                  regulations of this ordinance.
                  3-3. - Every use must be upon a lot.
                  No building or structure may be erected or use established unless upon a lot as defined by this ordinance except

                  3-4. - Only one principal building per lot.
                  Except as herein provided (see section 9-3, section 9-4, and section 9-5), there shall be no more than one
                  principal building or structure upon any lot in any residential district.
                  3-5. - Open space not to be encroached upon.
                  No open space shall be encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity to the yard, setback, offstreet parking space requirements, and such other regulations required by this ordinance for the district in which
                  such building is located. Shrubbery, driveways, retaining walls, fences, curbs, and planted buffer strips shall be
                  interpreted not to be encroachments of yards. (See section 3-24)
                  3-6. - Required open space may not be used by another building.
                  No part of any yard, other open space, or off-street parking or loading space required in connection with any
                  building, structure, or use by this ordinance shall be considered to be part of a required yard, or other open space,
                  or off-street parking or loading space for any other building, structure, or use except as provided in section 7-3.
                  3-7. - Reduction of yards or lot area.
                  Except as provided in section 3-22, no lot existing at the time of passage of this ordinance shall be reduced,

                  requirements of this ordinance for the district in which it is located unless said reduction or division is necessary
                  to provide land that is needed and accepted for public use.
                  3-8. - Encroachment on public rights-of-way.
                  No building, structure, service area, or required off-street parking and loading facility, except driveways, shall be
                  permitted to encroach on public rights-of-way.
                  3-9. - Location of accessory buildings or uses.
                  Accessory buildings on residential lots, when located within a front or side yard, shall be located no closer to
                  property lines than would be allowed for a principal building. Within a rear yard, an accessory building on a
                  residential lot shall be located at least five feet from all rear property lines, except that in the case of corner lots,
                  accessory buildings shall be set back from the centerline of an abutting street right-of-way a distance equal to
                  three-fourths the front yard setback established for the zoning district in which the accessory buildings are
                  located. In the case of a through lot (see section 3-11), accessory buildings shall conform to front yard setbacks
                  on both streets. Accessory buildings or uses on non-residential lots shall comply with front, side, and rear yard
                  requirements established for the zoning district in which such buildings or uses are located.
                  1.
                  Accessory building on separate lot: An accessory building may be permitted, as a special exception by the city
                  council on a separate lot from the lot of the principal building provided that: (a) the lot upon which the accessory
                  building is to be located shall be within 400 feet of the principal use; and (b) all requirements, including use
                  restrictions, established for the zoning district in which such accessory building is to be located shall be
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  222/321
                  complied with; and (c) any structure or building erected shall meet the requirements of the Georgia State
                  Building Code and shall be approved by the building inspector. In addition to the above requirements, the city
                  council may require design features such as buffer strips, screening, etc., as may be found necessary to protect
                  the purposes of this ordinance.
                  2.
                  Swimming pools: Swimming pools accessory to residences or commercial uses shall be enclosed by a steel mesh
                  security fence or other substantial building material affording equal or better access control. Said fence shall
                  have a minimum height of four feet and shall be lockable.
                  3.
                  Separation from principal use: Any accessory building of more than eight feet in height shall be located at least
                  ten feet from the principal building.
                  3-10. - Every lot shall abut a street.
                  No building shall be erected on a lot which does not abut an open public street.
                  3-11. - Lots with multiple frontage.
                  In the case of a corner lot, side yard setback requirements from the centerline of the street right-of-way shall
                  equal to 75 percent of that required for the front yard setback for the respective zoning district. On a corner lot
                  where the main entrance into a residence is facing a side yard, it shall be permissible for purposes of this
                  ordinance to interpret the residence to be fronting on the street other than that street which said entrance faces,
                  and side and rear yard requirements may be provided accordingly. If a building is constructed on a through lot
                  having frontage on two or more roads not at an intersection, a setback from each road shall be provided equal to
                  the front yard requirement for the district in which the lot is located.
                  3-12. - Visibility at intersections.
                  On corner lots within all zoning districts, no fence, shrubbery or other obstruction to the traffic sight vision,
                  except utility poles or light or sign standards, shall exceed a height of three feet within a triangular area formed
                  by the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two streets or a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way
                  line, and a diagonal line which intersects the right-of-way lines at two points, each 20 feet distance from the
                  intersection of the right-of-way lines, or, in the case of a rounded corner, from the point of intersection of their
                  tangents; provided, however, signs, lights, or similar objects which are totally located at least 12 feet above the
                  finished grade shall be permitted. (See illustration, page 12 [following this subsection].)
                  VISIBILITY AT INTERSECTIONS
                  (See section 3-12.)
                  3-13. - Uses prohibited.
                  If either a use or class of use is not specifically indicated as being permitted in a district, either as a matter of
                  right, or as a special exception, then such use, class of use, or structures for such uses, shall be prohibited in such
                  district.
                  3-14. - Fallout and/or storm shelters.
                  Fallout and/or storm shelters are permitted as principal or accessory uses in any district, subject to the yard
                  requirements of the district. Shelters shall be maintained so as not to become a hazard or blight to the
                  community.
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  223/321
                  The city council may permit, as a special exception, construction of joint shelters by two or more property
                  owners. Where such joint shelters are permitted, the city council may waive the side and rear yard setback
                  requirements on the property or properties directly involved in order to permit practical and efficient location and
                  construction; provided, however, that side and rear yard requirements shall be met where property involved in a
                  joint proposal abuts or adjoins property not included in the proposal.
                  3-15. - Zoning to apply when lot is divided by district boundary line.
                  In the event that a district boundary line on the zoning map divides a lot of record held in one ownership on the
                  date of passage of this ordinance, each part of the lot so divided shall be used in conformity with the regulations
                  established by this ordinance for the district in which such parcel is located; except, however, that if the property
                  owner of such a lot so desires, he may extend a use allowed on either portion of said lot 50 feet beyond the
                  district boundary line in accordance with setbacks and yard requirements of the district into which he is
                  encroaching.
                  3-16. - Height limitations of walls and fences.
                  Within any residential district, no wall or fence shall exceed eight feet in height within or along a boundary of a
                  rear or side yard. Within the front yard, all fences shall have a height limit of four feet.
                  3-17. - Required buffers in N-C, GB, WLI, and HI districts.
                  In an N-C, GB, WLI, and HI zoning district, where a lot abuts any residential district, a six foot wide buffer the
                  entire length of the lot abutting the residential property shall be provided with screening as specified in section 3-
                  19. Off-street parking associated with such uses shall be governed by this same provision.
                  3-18. - Screening of service areas within 150 feet of public street.
                  Any service area, loading area, refuse, or storage area between a principal building and a public street being
                  visible from said street and lying within 150 feet of said street shall be screened from view from the public street
                  as specified in section 3-19.
                  3-19. - Screening required.
                  Wherever screening is required by this ordinance, a durable masonry wall, or solid fence and hedge of sufficient
                  opaqueness to provide a visual blind, designed to be compatible with the character of adjoining properties, shall
                  be provided and maintained by the owner and his successors and assigns. Such fences and walls shall be at least
                  eight feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot line of the adjoining properties. Hedges or
                  comparable natural plantings shall be of such variety that an average height of at least six feet could be expected
                  by normal growth within no later than three years from the time of planting. The owner/developer shall install
                  the required screening prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Occupancy will not be allowed until
                  the screening is completed as a part of the normal developmental requirements.
                  3-20. - Side and rear yards not required next to railroad.
                  Within any non-residential district, side yards and rear yards shall not be required adjacent to railroad rights-ofway.
                  3-21. - Substandard lots of record.
                  Any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance which has an area or a width which is less
                  than that required by this ordinance may be used as a building site for a structure or use permitted in that zone;
                  provided, however, that the same yard, setback, open space, and other dimensional requirements are met that
                  would be required for a standard lot, except as stipulated in section 3-25.
                  3-22. - Permitted modification of setback requirement.
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  224/321
                  When a building is proposed on a lot and when on either or both lots which adjoin such lot at the street right-ofway line there exists a principal building which does not conform to the setback requirements of this ordinance,
                  the required setback for such building shall be as follows: (1) where only one said adjoining lot contains a
                  principal building with a non-conforming setback, the setback shall be the computed average of (a) the normal
                  setback requirement with (b) the non-conforming setback, or (2) where both adjoining lots contain a principal
                  building each with a non-conforming setback, the minimum setback shall be the computed average of the two
                  non-conforming setbacks.
                  3-23. - Structures permitted above the height limit.
                  The height limits of this ordinance shall not apply to a church spire, belfry, cupola, dome, or ornamental tower
                  not intended for human occupancy, monument, water tower, observation tower, transmission tower, chimney,
                  smoke stack, conveyor, flag pole, radio or television tower, mast or aerial, parapet wall not extending more than
                  four feet above the roof line of the building, and necessary mechanical appurtenances.
                  3-24. - Permitted encroachments of yards and setbacks.
                  Architectural features such as cornices, eaves, steps, gutters, and fire escapes may project not more than three
                  feet beyond any required setback line, except where such projections would obstruct driveways which are or may
                  be used for access for service and/or emergency vehicles; provided, however, that in the case of automobile
                  service stations, motels, and similar uses which serve the motoring public, canopies shall be allowed over a
                  driveway or walkways within the front yard not to extend from the principal building to a point any closer than
                  15 feet from the street right-of-way line.
                  3-25. - Modification of side yard requirements.
                  When a lot of record has a width less than the frontage required in the district in which it is located, then the
                  zoning administrator shall be authorized to reduce the side yard requirements for such lot; provided, however,
                  that there shall not be less than an eight foot side yard.
                  3-26. - Zoning of annexed area.
                  Areas annexed to the City of Ty Ty subsequent to the adoption of this ordinance shall be subject to this ordinance
                  as is all land area currently located in the corporate limits of the city. It is required that the annexation petition be
                  accompanied by the petitioner's request for rezoning, and consideration of such property for initial City of Ty Ty

                  SECTION 4. - ZONING DISTRICTS
                  4-1. - Establishment of districts.
                  In order that the purposes of this ordinance as defined in section 1 may be accomplished, there are hereby
                  established within the City of Ty Ty, Georgia, zoning districts, identified as follows:
                  1.
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  225/321
                  E-R Environmental Resource: The purpose of this district is to protect the ecologically sensitive areas of the City
                  of Ty Ty and to limit the active development to those uses which are compatible with the natural limits of the
                  land.
                  2.
                  A-U Agricultural Use: The purpose of this district is to permit agricultural uses, to encourage the maintenance of
                  the rural countryside, to preserve forests and other undeveloped lands away from areas of population growth, and
                  to allow residents to retain their traditional ways of life. The preferred land use in the district is agricultural,
                  either active in the form of crops, or passive in the form of forest management or pasture lands. The A-U district
                  should be utilized as a land use designation where a more intensive use of the land is unlikely to occur in the near
                  future. The requirements of the district are designed to encourage the maintenance of a rural character until more
                  intensive development is feasible.
                  3.
                  R-14 Single Family Residential: The purpose of this district is to provide single family residential areas with
                  minimum lot sizes of 14,000 square feet, said areas being protected from the depreciating effects of small lot
                  development and excessive density and from the encroachment of those uses which are incompatible to a
                  desirable residential environment.
                  4.
                  R-8 Residential: The purpose of this district is to provide residential areas with a minimum lot size of 8,000
                  square feet, said areas being protected from uses which are incompatible to a desirable residential environment.
                  5.
                  M-R Multiple Residential: The purpose of this district is to provide orderly development of higher density
                  residential areas for one, two, and multi-family dwellings, with minimum lot sizes of 6,000 square feet, said
                  areas being protected from the encroachment of those uses which are incompatible to a desirable residential
                  environment.
                  6.
                  R-14-M Residential: The purpose of this district is to create an area that, in addition to conventional housing,
                  allows manufactured housing as a matter of right in a conventional subdivision. Lots in this district must have a
                  minimum of 14,000 square feet. These districts shall be protected from the encroachment of incompatible uses
                  which are detrimental to a sound residential environment.
                  7.
                  M-H-P Manufactured Housing Park: The purpose of this district is to provide for the development of property
                  that is suitably located and planned for manufactured home park use. Property developed in this district is to
                  remain in single ownership for rental purposes only. Manufactured housing parks shall be developed only in
                  strict accordance with the manufacturing housing park provisions of this ordinance.
                  8.
                  N-C Neighborhood Commercial District: The purpose of this district shall be to provide and protect convenient
                  areas for neighborhood shopping facilities.
                  9.
                  G-B General Business District: The purpose of this district shall be to provide for and encourage the proper
                  grouping and development of uses which include a wide variety of sales and services that will best accommodate
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances

                  10.
                  C-B-D Central Business District: The purpose of this district shall be to accommodate development which will
                  include a wide variety of sales and services which locate in the city's historical central business district. Due to
                  the unique design of this district to serve the special needs of the city's historical central business district,
                  applications for this zoning designation will not be accepted.
                  11.
                  C-A Adult Commercial: This zoning district shall include C-A (1) and C-A (2) zoning districts as associate uses
                  are outlined in section 5-1 of the Zoning Ordinance for the City of Ty Ty. The purpose of this district shall be to
                  provide a reasonable location within the community for the development of adult-oriented businesses, including
                  adult entertainment establishments, tattoo parlors, adult bookstores, adult video stores, body piercing
                  establishments, and adult novelty stores.
                  12.
                  WLI Wholesale-Light Industrial District: The purpose of this district shall be to provide and protect areas for
                  those wholesale and light industrial uses which do not create excessive noise, odor, smoke, dust, and which do
                  not possess other objectionable characteristics which might be detrimental to surrounding neighborhoods, or to
                  the other uses permitted in the district.
                  13.

                  4-2. - Official zoning map and major thoroughfare plan.
                  The boundaries of each district are shown on a map entitled "Official Zoning Map, City of Ty Ty, Georgia." The
                  classification of streets (local and collector streets and principal and minor arterials) are indicated on a map

                  4.
                  Where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as being set back from the centerline of a street rightof-way, road, highway, railroad, stream, or river, and parallel thereto, then such district boundaries, unless
                  otherwise specifically indicated, shall be interpreted as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of such

                  which it is located, shall be governed by the following restrictions in addition to the other requirements in this
                  ordinance:
                  1.

                  2.
                  An existing non-conforming use of a structure shall not be changed to another non-conforming use that generates
                  more automobile or truck traffic, creates more noise, vibration, smoke, dust or fumes, is a more intensive use of
                  structures than the existing non-conforming use, and is in any way a greater nuisance to the adjoining properties

                  3.
                  A non-conforming use of a structure shall not be extended or enlarged except into portions of the structure which
                  at the time the use became non-conforming were already erected and arranged or designed for such nonconforming use. No structural alterations shall be made in any structure occupied by a non-conforming use,

                  Vacancy and/or non-use of the building, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant, shall constitute
                  discontinuance under this provision.
                  8-4. - Non-conforming signs.
                  Non-conforming signs shall be allowed to continue, except as provided in section 10-2.1 and 10-3, as follows:

                  make the sign comply with the requirements of this ordinance.

                  permitted.
                  4.
                  Except for the signs which violate the restrictions contained in paragraph 10-2.1 which are deemed to be
                  dangerous and hazardous to the citizens of Ty Ty and others traveling on the streets in the City of Ty Ty, any sign
                  that exists on the day that this ordinance is enacted shall be allowed to remain even though the sign is nonconforming. However, in the event that any non-conforming sign is either removed, abandoned, fails to have a
                  legible message thereon, or is seriously damaged and is not repaired or replaced within a period of 30 days, then
                  no new sign shall be put on said location unless it conforms with the requirements of this ordinance.
                  8-5. - Reconstruction of non-conforming structures.
                  When a non-conforming structure or a structure containing a non-conforming use or non-conforming sign is
                  razed or damaged by fire, flood, wind, or act of God, such structure or sign may be reconstructed as a nonconforming use only if the damage totals less than 75 percent of the value of the structure. Structures which do
                  not conform to the yard requirements of this ordinance shall also be governed by this provision.
                  8-6. - Changes in zoning.

                  11-2. - Building permit required.
                  A building permit, or a sign permit in case of a sign, issued by the zoning administrator is required in advance of
                  the initiation of construction, erection, moving, demolition, or alteration of any building or structure or sign. No
                  building or sign permit shall be issued except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance; however, a
                  building permit issued before the adoption of this ordinance shall remain valid with the same qualifications as
                  issued under this ordinance.
                  11-3. - Application for building permit.
                  All applications for building permits for single family residences (including manufactured homes), duplexes, and
                  agricultural buildings and their accessory uses are exempt from detailed site plan application requirements.
                  Applications for permits for these uses may be hand drawn but must properly show the correct dimensions of the
                  proposed building lot and the proposed structure so as to allow planning, environmental and engineering staff to
                  properly inform the applicant of setback requirements, spacing requirements for well and/or septic, driveway
                  location requirements, and other ordinance/Code requirements.
                  All other land uses (multi-family and all commercial and industrial uses) shall require a more detailed site plan.
                  Applications for multi-family, commercial and industrial uses shall require the submittal of a plat of survey of
                  the proposed building lot accompanied by two side plans drawn to scale showing the actual dimensions of the lot
                  to be built upon, the size and location of the lot, number of dwelling units (if applicable), footprint dimensions to
                  scale, and the setback lines of the proposed structures. Topographic lines at mean sea level, both existing and
                  proposed, drainage plans, proposed size and location of ingress/egress, water and/or sewer mains and services,
                  both existing and proposed, including hydrants and meter size shall also be shown so as to allow planning,
                  environmental and engineering staff to properly review the development proposal to ensure compliance with the
                  zoning ordinance and other applicable Code standards.
                  Any building permit shall become void if the work involved has not begun within six months after the date of
                  issuance of the permit or if the work or development authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a
                  period of six months after the work of development is commenced; provided that extensions of time and periods
                  not exceeding six months each may be allowed in writing by the zoning administrator. Any unapproved
                  deviation from the site plan shall cause the zoning administrator to not issue a certificate of occupancy.
                  The applicant for a building permit shall submit a certificate with his application which certifies that the lot
                  which he proposes to develop is a lot of record. When the lot in question does not meet the lot width and lot area
                  requirements of this ordinance, then the applicant shall certify that such lot was a lot of record prior to the
                  adoption of this ordinance or is a lot which has been created through governmental taking of property.
                  11-4. - Sign permits.
                  The zoning administrator shall receive applications for the construction of signs, as required by this ordinance.
                  Such applications shall follow the same forms as required for building permits, and shall contain information
                  required by this ordinance in section 10. The zoning administrator shall process such sign applications and shall
                  issue sign permits and sign permit numbers for proposed signs which comply with the requirements of this
                  ordinance.

                  maintained, or any building, structure, or land is or is proposed to be used in violation of these regulations, the
                  zoning administrator, city attorney, or other appropriate city authority or any adjacent or neighboring property
                  owner or occupant who would be damaged by such violation may. In addition to other remedies, institute
                  injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection,
                  construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance, or use; or to correct or abate such violation, or

                  administrator. He shall record properly such complaint, investigate within 30 days and take action thereon as
                  provided in these regulations.
                  11-8. - Cancellation of permits.
                  A demolition, building, or sign permit shall be canceled by the zoning administrator when the method of
                  demolition, construction, or use violates any provision contained in these regulations, or any state or local
                  ordinance or resolution. Upon such cancellation, any further work upon the demolition, construction, alteration,
                  or repair on said building or structure, and any further use of said building or structure or land, shall be deemed a
                  violation. Each and every day such unlawful demolition, construction, alteration, or repair on said building or
                  structure, or further use of said building or structure or land continues shall be deemed a separate offense.

                  Issuance of certificate of occupancy: Upon payment of all required fees, the zoning administrator shall sign and
                  issue a certificate of occupancy if the proposed use of land or building is found to conform to the applicable

                  plan submitted and approved for the building permit. One copy of all certificates of occupancy issued which
                  contain a statement of the intended.
                  3.
                  Denial of certificate of occupancy: A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued unless the proposed use of a
                  building or land conforms to the applicable provisions of this ordinance, and substantially complies with the
                  sketches or plans submitted for obtaining the building permit.
                  11-10. - Reason for denial of permit.
                  When a permit is denied, the zoning administrator shall provide in writing, upon request of the applicant for a

                  SECTION 12. - ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS, SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS AND VARIANCES
                  12-1. - Administrative appeals.
                  Appeals from the decisions of the zoning administrator with regard to interpretation, administration, and
                  enforcement shall be made to the Ty Ty City Council. The Ty Ty City Council shall hear and decide upon
                  appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning
                  administrator.
                  1.
                  Who may appeal: Appeals to the Ty Ty City Council may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer,
                  department, board, or bureau of the governing authority affected by any decision of the zoning administrator.
                  Such appeals shall be filed no later than 30 days after the date of notification of the decision appealed from by
                  filing with the zoning administrator, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The zoning administrator

                  Legal proceedings stayed: An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
                  unless the zoning administrator certifies to the council after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him,
                  that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and
                  property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be
                  granted by the council or by a court of record on application, on notice to the zoning administrator, and on due
                  cause shown.

                  evidence on matters before the Ty Ty City Council.
                  4.

                  regulations, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination

                  12-2. - Special exception.
                  The city council may hear and decide upon special exceptions as authorized by section 5, schedule of permitted
                  uses, of this ordinance.
                  1.
                  Special exception review criteria: The application to establish such Special Exception use shall be approved on a
                  finding by the city council that:
                  a.
                  The proposed use will not be contrary to the purpose of this ordinance.
                  b.
                  The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general
                  neighborhood nor affect adversely the health and safety of residents and workers.
                  c.
                  The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or
                  use such facility, vehicular movement, noise or fumes generation, or type of physical activity.
                  d.
                  The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses of adjacent properties; and the proposed use
                  will be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use.
                  e.
                  The parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted
                  will be met.
                  f.
                  Provided that the city council may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards (i.e., increased
                  setbacks, buffer strips, screening, etc.) as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of residents and
                  workers in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; and
                  provided, that wherever the city council shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of
                  this ordinance that any term, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being
                  complied with, the city council shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties
                  concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
                  g.

                  262/321
                  Special exceptions granted by the city council shall be exercised within 12 months from date of approval, shall
                  not be transferable except upon written approval of the city council, or shall become null and void and subject to
                  procedures for resubmission as hereinabove established.
                  12-3. - Request for a variance.
                  The city council may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the dimensional standards and
                  development requirements of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special
                  conditions, a literal enforcement of provisions of this ordinance will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary
                  hardship, so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial
                  justice done. Provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for a use of land or building or structure that
                  is prohibited by this ordinance in the district in question.
                  1.
                  Variance review criteria: A variance may be granted in an individual case upon finding by the city council that all
                  of the following exists:
                  a.
                  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question
                  because of its size, shape, or topography; and
                  b.
                  The application of all dimensional standards and development requirements to this particular piece of property
                  would render the particular property unusable; and
                  c.
                  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved, or, in the alternative, that such
                  conditions are due to the location of existing utilities, etc.; and
                  d.
                  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of
                  this ordinance; provided that no variance may be granted for a use of land, building or structure that is prohibited
                  by this ordinance. Applications for use variances shall not be accepted by the zoning administrator. Such
                  requests shall be properly filed as requests for rezoning; and
                  e.
                  Provided that the city council may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards (i.e., increased
                  setbacks, buffer strips, screening, etc.) as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of residents and
                  workers in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood. Provided,
                  that whenever the city council shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of this
                  ordinance that any of the terms, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being
                  complied with, the city council shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties
                  concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
                  12-4. - Public hearing required.
                  Before making its decision on any administrative appeal, request for a special exception, or request for a
                  variance, the Ty Ty City Council shall hold a public hearing thereon.

                  Failure of the applicant to provide truthful or complete information shall invalidate said application from the
                  beginning. Such required public hearing notice shall contain the name(s) of the appellant or petitioner, the date,
                  time, and place set for the public hearing, and shall contain a brief statement of the nature of the hearing.
                  2.
                  Who may appear: Any party may appear at the public hearing in person or by agent or by attorney.
                  12-5. - Forms.
                  Administrative appeals, requests for permission to establish a use requiring special exception approval, and
                  requests for variances shall be made on forms provided therefore, and all information required on said forms
                  shall be provided by the appellant. Forms shall be filed with the zoning administrator. No form shall be accepted

                  $100.00 to defray expenses. Once filed, these fees are non-refundable.

                  Within five days after the routine monthly application acceptance deadline, the zoning administrator shall
                  transmit two copies of the rezoning application to the planning commission, and applicable local staff members,

                  the adopted local comprehensive plan, and the adopted standards for exercise of the zoning powers. The staff
                  report and planning commission recommendations shall then be transmitted to the city council. The planning
                  commission shall have 25 days within which to submit a report to the city council. If the planning commission
                  fails to submit a report within 25 days, it shall be deemed to have recommended approval of the requested
                  amendment.
                  b.
                  Prior to initiating any formal annexation activities, (any municipality located within Tift County) will notify the
                  county government of any proposed annexation by providing information on location of property, size of area
                  and proposed land use or zoning classifications (if applicable) of the property proposed to be annexed by
                  delivering a written notice to the county administrator. Simultaneously, such city shall transmit notice of the
                  proposed annexation to the planning commission for its review and recommendation.
                  Within 25 working days following receipt of the above information, the county will forward to the city proposing
                  annexation a statement either: (a) indicating that the county has no objection to the proposed land use for the
                  property; or (b) describing its bona fide objections to the city's proposed land use classification, providing
                  supporting information, and listing any possible stipulations or conditions that would alleviate the county's
                  objection(s).
                  Following review and recommendation from the planning commission, the county shall take action consistent
                  with subparagraph 13-2.8 of this ordinance.

                  Not less than 15 days prior to the date set for the public hearing on any application for a map amendment (other
                  than a map amendment initiated by the planning commission or the city council), the zoning administrator shall
                  erect a sign on the land proposed to be reclassified. Such sign shall be erected by the zoning administrator within
                  ten feet of whatever boundary line of such land abuts the most traveled public road; and, if no public road abuts
                  thereon, then such sign shall be erected to face in such a manner as may be most readily seen by the public. The
                  sign shall show the application number, the present zoning classification, the proposed zoning classification, the
                  scheduled date, time, and place of public hearing, and the telephone number to call for further information. If the
                  land sought to be reclassified lies within more than one block as shown on a plat recorded in the land records of
                  the county, then a sign shall be erected on the land in each such block.
                  b.
                  Removal of sign: Any such sign shall be maintained at all times by the zoning administrator until a decision on
                  the application has been made by the city council.

                  Hearing called: Before taking action on a proposed amendment, the Ty Ty City Council shall hold a public
                  hearing thereon. At least 15 but not more than 45 days notice of the time, place, and purpose of said hearing shall
                  be published in a newspaper of general circulation within Tift County. Such notice shall also state the application
                  number and date, and shall contain a summary of the proposed amendment, and in the case of a map amendment,
                  the location of the property, its area, the name of the owner or their authorized agent, and the present and
                  proposed zoning classification for the property affected.
                  Further, such advertisement shall advise the public pursuant to O.C.G.A. 36-67A-3 that any opponent of a
                  proposed rezoning action who has made campaign contributions aggregating $250.00 or more to a local
                  government official of the local government which will consider the application within two years of the date of
                  the application shall be required to file a disclosure with the governing authority of the respective local
                  government showing: (1) the name and official position of the local government official to whom campaign
                  contributions were made; and (2) the dollar amount and description of each campaign contribution made by the
                  opponent to the local government official during the five years immediately preceding the filing of the
                  application for the proposed rezoning action and the date of each contribution. Such disclosure shall be required
                  to be filed at least five calendar days prior to the scheduled hearing.
                  b.
                  Notice to interested parties: A notice shall be given to the applicant and the planning commission of the date,
                  time, and place of the public hearing. All application files shall be placed in the custody of the zoning
                  administrator and be open to public inspection during regular office hours.
                  c.
                  Public hearing procedure: All public hearings on zoning matters shall be placed on the city council agenda under
                  a section entitled "Public Hearings." The mayor, or his designee, shall officially declare the public hearing open
                  and shall note that the City of Ty Ty's written Public Hearing Procedures, the City of Ty Ty's Standards for
                  Exercise of Zoning Powers, and a copy of Georgia's Conflict of Interest Law are available to the attending public
                  as a handout and are posted for public review.
                  The zoning administrator and/or designee shall then announce the matter for consideration. The mayor shall then
                  call for acknowledgment of a potential conflict of interest by members of the city council. The zoning
                  administrator will then report the staff recommendation and the recommendation of the Greater Tift County
                  Planning and Zoning Commission. The mayor shall then allow public input. General procedures to be followed
                  will require citizen comments to be heard in an orderly fashion. Citizens speaking in favor of the request shall be
                  heard first, followed by those opposed to the issue. All speakers will be asked to provide his or her name and
                  address for the public record. Citizens are requested to keep their comments as brief as possible so that all who
                  wish to be heard will have adequate time. When there are a large number of citizens wishing to testify at a given
                  hearing, the presiding officer may invoke reasonable time limitations on both the proponents and opponents of a
                  request. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to both sides of an issue equally, such minimum time period
                  to be no less than ten minutes per side. Citizens shall address their comments to the city council as a whole.
                  Individual attacks or cross examination of city council members, city employees or other citizens will be ruled
                  out of order. The city council retains the privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for
                  clarification.
                  After all citizen comments have been received, all further discussion of the specific application is reserved for
                  the city council. The mayor shall then declare the public hearing closed and no further public comment will be
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  267/321
                  entertained. The city council will then render a decision on the application. Decisions may include approval,
                  denial or tabling of the decision to a time, place and date specific.
                  IN THE CASE OF TABLING OF A MATTER, NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BE
                  ENTERTAINED UPON FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE MATTER.
                  When, in the opinion of the city council, the official public hearing has brought forth substantial new evidence or
                  testimony not available to the Greater Tift County Planning and Zoning Commission at the time of their review
                  of a zoning matter, or should the city council desire to request further study by the planning and zoning
                  commission of a particular aspect of an application, it shall be the policy of the city council to table the issue and
                  request that the planning and zoning commission restudy the issue and affirm or amend its recommendation,
                  which action shall be reported to the city council prior to making a final decision.
                  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL PUBLIC COMMENT BE ENTERTAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL
                  FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE PUBLIC HEARING.
                  d.
                  Standards for exercise of zoning powers: In order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
                  City of Ty Ty against the unrestricted use of property, the following standards, and any other factors relevant to
                  balancing the above stated public interests, shall be considered as they apply to any rezoning application brought
                  before the city council for decision:
                  (1)
                  The existing land use pattern;
                  (2)
                  The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts;
                  (3)
                  The existing population density pattern and the possible increase or overtaxing of the load on public facilities;
                  (4)
                  Whether changed or changing conditions make the passage of the proposed amendment reasonable;
                  (5)
                  Whether the proposed change will adversely influence existing conditions in the neighborhood or the city at
                  large;
                  (6)
                  Potential impact on the environment, including but not limited to drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation,
                  flooding, air quality, and water quality and quantity;
                  (7)
                  The reasonableness of the costs required of the public in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public
                  utilities, schools, streets and public safety necessities when considering the proposed changes;
                  (8)
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  268/321
                  Whether the proposed change will be detrimental to the value or improvement of development of adjacent or
                  nearby property in accordance with existing requirements;
                  (9)
                  Whether the proposed change is out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or the City of Ty Ty;
                  (10)
                  Whether the proposed change will constitute a grant of special privilege to the individual owner as contrasted
                  with the adjacent or nearby neighborhood or with the general public; and
                  (11)
                  The extent to which the zoning decision is consistent with the 2010 Greater Tift Comprehensive Plan, as duly
                  amended.
                  e.
                  Public hearings records standards: The city clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of all zoning public
                  hearings. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but only if
                  requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party, who must arrange at his expense for a certified court
                  reporter to record and transcribe the hearing and furnish the original of the transcript to the city council for its
                  records. The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at
                  the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular zoning application
                  file.
                  8.
                  Annexation land use resolution process:
                  a.
                  If the county has no objection to the city's proposed land us or zoning classification, the city is free to proceed
                  with the annexation. If the county fails to respond to the city's notice in writing within the deadline set forth in
                  paragraph 13-2.5(b) above, the city is free to proceed with the annexation and the county loses its right to invoke
                  the dispute resolution process, stop the annexation or object to land use changes after the annexation;
                  b.
                  If the county notifies the city that it has a bona fide land use classification objection(s), the city will respond to
                  the county in writing within 25 working days of receiving the county's objection(s) by either: (a) agreeing to
                  implement the county's stipulations and conditions and thereby resolving the county's objection(s); (b) agreeing
                  with the county and stopping action on the proposed annexation; (c) disagreeing that the county's objection(s) are
                  bona fide and notifying the county that the city will seek a declaratory judgment in court; or (d) initiating a 30
                  day (maximum) mediation process to discuss possible compromises;
                  c.
                  If the city initiates mediation, the mediation will proceed according to terms adopted by intergovernmental
                  agreement outlining procedures for mediator selection, scheduling and negotiations sufficient to ensure adequate
                  consideration within the time frame set forth in subparagraph (b) above. The city and county agree to share
                  equally any costs associated with the mediation;
                  d.
                  8/30/2019 Ty Ty, GA Code of Ordinances
                  269/321
                  If no resolution of the county's bona fide land use classification objection(s) results from the mediation, the city
                  will not proceed with the proposed annexation; and
                  e.
                  If the city and county reach agreement independent from or as a result of the mediation, they will draft an
                  annexation agreement for execution by the city and county governments and the property owner(s).
                  Regardless of future changes in land use or zoning classification, any site-specific mitigation or enhancement
                  measures or site-design stipulations included in the agreement will be binding on all parties for the duration of
                  the annexation agreement. The agreement shall become final when signed by the city, the county, and property
                  owner(s).

                  within shall govern.

                  If any section, clause, portion or provision of this ordinance is found unconstitutional, such invalidity shall not
                  affect any other portion of this ordinance.
