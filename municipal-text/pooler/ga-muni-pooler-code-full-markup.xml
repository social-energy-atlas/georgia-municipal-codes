PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Pooler, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through December 21, 1987, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the aldermanic board. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Code Attorney, and Leesa Hampton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Honorable Earl L. Carter, Mayor, City of Pooler, Ms. Maribeth Lindler, City Clerk, Mr. Dennis Baxter, City Manager, and Mr. J. Wiley Ellis, City Attorney for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

For example, the codifier may:

                  Sec. 6-12. - Sunday sales. 
                  (a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Sunday sales means the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises in eating establishments or inns between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 11:30 p.m. 
                  Eating establishment means an establishment: 
                  (1)  Whose primary business is the sale of prepared meals; 
                  (2)  Which is licensed to sell distilled spirits, malt beverages or wine; and 
                  (3)  Which derives at least 50 percent of its total annual gross food and beverage sales from the sale of prepared meals or food. 
                  A commercial eating establishment shall have its primary floor area specifically designed, set aside, set up and operating to serve meals and food on the premises and shall have a fully-equipped commercial kitchen to include an appropriate stove, refrigerator, food preparation area, sink and other items required by the county health department and city inspections department for the preparation of food.

                  (b)  Intent. The intent of this section is to allow those full service restaurants that serve the public as part of the city's tourism business to sell alcoholic beverages with meals on Sunday.

                  (c)  License application classifications. The following three license application classifications and criteria for Sunday sales licenses are established: 
                  (1)  New applicant at new location means an eating establishment or inn that has not been licensed for alcoholic beverage sales for any purpose for at least one year prior to application at such place of business. 
                  (2)  Application at existing location means an application for a Sunday sales license at a location which has an alcoholic beverage license under the same ownership or the previous business ownership within the previous license year. 
                  (3)  Application at existing location with alcoholic beverage and Sunday sales license (transfer) and/or renewal means a transfer or renewal of a Sunday sales license at an existing licensed location, licensed within the previous license year. 
                  (d)  Licensing procedures. 
                  (1)  An applicant for a new location shall include an affidavit by the applicant certifying to the intent to meet the requirements of this section and that it will be either an eating establishment or inn. Each new applicant, after having operated for a period of 12 months, must provide to the police department a certified public accountant (CPA) or registered public accountant (RPA) certified affidavit as set forth in subsection (d)(3) of this section. 
                  (2)  An application for an existing location shall include an affidavit by the applicant certifying to the intent to meet the requirements of this section for Sunday sales, and that such location is either an eating establishment or an inn. 
                  (3)  An application for a transfer or renewal license shall include a certified affidavit from a certified public accountant (CPA) or registered public accountant (RPA) attesting to the accuracy of the financial information supplied to him and that such location derived at least 50 percent of its gross revenues for the last 12 months of business under present or previous ownership from the sale of prepared meals or room rental in the case of an inn. In the absence of such data, the business owner will not be considered for Sunday liquor sales until a certified affidavit from a CPA or RPA is submitted certifying as to the revenues for the immediate 12 months of business preceding the time of application for a Sunday sales license. 
                  (4)  Each serving location or place under the same ownership and within the same building or structure under one roof shall be considered one business under the terms of this section, and shall be licensed by one application and one license issued. 
                  (5)  A separate license shall be required for serving locations in separate buildings under the same ownership or management control, and for all locations under separate ownership or management or ownership control. 
                  (6)  A separate license shall be required for a serving location within a building or structure if that serving location is under separate ownership or management control from other serving locations within the same building or structure, and in such case, each serving location shall meet the appropriate criteria for a Sunday sales license without considering either food sales or room rental of the owner serving locations within the same building or structure. 
                  (7)  The accounting and purchasing records for each license issued under this section must be maintained in a manner that is separate and distinct from any other business or activity. 
                  (8)  A nonrefundable application fee of $25.00 is required for all Sunday sales license applications. The license fee for Sunday sales of alcoholic beverages shall be $150.00, which shall be refundable if the application is not approved. A license application for the Sunday sales of distilled spirits for such establishments shall be completed by December 31 of the year preceding the year for which the license is sought and returned to the city before March 1 for approval. Failure to return the application or failure to supply all information requested will result in disapproval of the application and disapproval of the license. 
                  (9)  An affidavit for a new license shall be completed by the licensee. An affidavit for a transfer or renewal must be completed by an independent certified public accountant or a registered public accountant. This affidavit must be based upon the general ledger and attached to the application for each yearly license attesting to the fact that at least 50 percent of its total annual gross income is derived from the rental of rooms for overnight lodging or from prepared meals if it is an eating establishment. Failure to attach such affidavit or failure to comply with the terms of the affidavit will result in disapproval of the application and disapproval of the license. 
                  (e)  Miscellaneous provisions. 
                  (1)  Only dealers licensed under this section are authorized to sell distilled spirits, malt beverages or wine for consumption on the premises in those eating establishments and inns so licensed on Sundays, in compliance with the Georgia Alcoholic Beverage Code, O.C.G.A. § 3-3-1 et seq. 
                  (2)  In enforcing this section, the city and its authorized agents, employees and representatives have the right to audit the records and financial books of applicants and license holders. The city and its authorized agents, employees and representatives also have the right to enter upon the premises of applicants and license holders to inspect the premises and determine whether they comply with this section.

                  The proposed revisions will add operational standards, such as zoning requirements and operational standards and require an annual entertainment permit. The entertainment permit would require the permitting of any venue having live entertainment. 
                  Therefore, the changes will require all alcohol-serving establishments having entertainment within the city to obtain an entertainment permit. The changes will create a consistent set of regulations for all entertainment venues within the city.

                  There are created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the primary zone, precision instrument approach zones, nonprecision instrument approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zones and conical zones. Such areas and zones are shown on the Savannah International Airport Airspace Zoning Map dated June 1, 1985. Such map is made a part of this article to the same extent as if the information set forth on such map was fully designed and incorporated in this article, and may be amended subsequent to the adoption thereof. Such map shall be kept on file in the office of the city manager. The various zones established are shown in illustration number 1 and are defined as follows: 
                  (1)  Primary zone. An area longitudinally centered on a runway and extending 200 feet at each end of such runway. The width of the primary zone is 1,000 feet for a nonprecision instrument runway having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths of a statute mile, and for precision instrument runways. No structure or obstruction will be permitted within the primary zone that is not part of the landing and take-off facilities and is of a greater height than the nearest point on the runway centerline. 
                  (2)  Approach zone. An area longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward from each end of the primary zone. An approach zone is designed for each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for that runway end. 
                  a.  Precision instrument approach zone. An instrument approach zone is established at each end of precision instrument runways. The inner edge of the precision instrument approach zone shall have a width of 1,000 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway. The inner edge shall then widen uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a distance of 50,200 feet beyond each end of the runway. 
                  b.  Nonprecision instrument approach zone. A nonprecision instrument approach zone is established at each end of nonprecision runways. The inner edge of the nonprecision instrument approach zone shall have a width of 1,000 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway. The inner edge shall then widen uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet for that end of a nonprecision instrument runway having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths of a statute mile. This type of approach zone extends to a horizontal distance of 10,200 feet beyond each end of the runway. 
                  (3)  Transitional zone. A transitional zone is established adjacent to each precision and nonprecision instrument runway. They extend outward from the sides of the primary and approach zones and connect to the horizontal and conical zones. Transitional zones are further established adjacent to the precision instrument approach zone which projects through and beyond the limits of the conical zone, extending a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally, from the edge of the precision instrument approach zone perpendicular to the extended centerline of the runway. 
                  (4)  Horizontal zone. A horizontal zone is the area within the perimeter of a horizontal plane that is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway of each airport and connecting to the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is 10,000 feet for all runways at the airport. 
                  The radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value. That value will be the highest composite value determined for either end of the runway. When a 5,000-foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two adjacent 10,000-foot arcs, the 5,000-foot arc shall be disregarded on the construction of the perimeter of the horizontal plane. The horizontal zone does not include the precision, nonprecision approach and transitional zones. 
                  (5)  Conical zone. A conical zone is established as the area that begins at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. 
                  (Code 1976, § 2½-6) 
                  Sec. 18-36. - Height limits. 
                  Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow or maintained in any zone to a height in excess of the height limit established for such zone in this section. If any structure or tree is erected, altered, allowed to grow or maintained in an area located in more than one zone, then that structure or tree will be considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are established and defined as follows: 
                  (1)  Precision instrument approach zone. One foot in height for each 50 feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point 200 feet from and at the centerline elevation of the end of the instrument runway and extending to a distance of 10,200 feet from the end of the runway, thence one foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway. 
                  (2)  Nonprecision instrument approach zone. One foot vertically for each 34 feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point 200 feet from, and at the centerline elevation of, the nonprecision instrument runway and extending to a point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway. 
                  (3)  Transitional zone. The area extending outward from the sides of the primary zone and approach zones connecting them to the horizontal and conical zones. Height limits within the transitional zone are the same as the primary zone or approach zone at the boundary line where it adjoins and increases at a rate of one foot vertically for every seven feet horizontally, with the horizontal distance measured at right angles to the runway centerline and extended centerline, until the height matches the height of the horizontal zone or conical zone, or for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the side of the part of the precision approach zone that extends beyond the conical zone. 
                  (4)  Horizontal zone. One hundred fifty feet above established airport elevation. 
                  (5)  Conical zone. The area extending outward from the periphery of the horizontal zone for a distance of 4,000 feet. Height limitations for structures in the conical zone are 150 feet above the airport height at the inner boundary with permitted height increasing one foot vertically every 20 feet to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.

                  Sec. 18-37. - Nonconforming obstructions. 
                  The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations of this article when adopted or amended, or to otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing contained in this section shall require any change in the construction or alteration of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the adoption of or to any amendments to this article and is diligently prosecuted and completed within six months thereof. 
                  (Code 1976, § 2½-8) 
                  Sec. 18-38. - Permits. 
                  (a)  No nonconforming structure or tree may be erected, replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher or replanted in any zone created in this article unless a permit is secured from the zoning administrator authorizing such replacement, change or repair, except as follows: 
                  (1)  No permit shall be required for any structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such structure would extend above the height limits within the: 
                  a.  Entire limits of the horizontal, conical or transitional zones. 
                  b.  Limits of the precision instrument approach zones. 
                  (b)  Each permit application shall indicate the purpose for which such permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to determine whether the resulting use or structure would conform to the regulations prescribed in this article. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit applied for shall be granted. 
                  (c)  No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of this article, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. 
                  (d)  Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming use, structure or tree has been abandoned or is more than 70 percent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.

                  Sec. 18-39. - Hazard marking and lighting. 
                  Any permit granted under section 18-38 may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purposes of this article and reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the airport commission, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. 
                  (Code 1976, § 2½-10) 
                  Sec. 18-40. - Removal of nonconforming structures. 
                  The airport commission may negotiate with owners of nonconforming structures for removal, lighting or marking of existing nonconforming structures, to be installed, operated and maintained at the airport commission's expense. 
                  (Code 1976, § 2½-11) 
                  Sec. 18-41. - Variance. 
                  No variance, special exception or any other appeal within any zone created by this article shall be considered or granted which would violate any restriction imposed by this article. 
                  (Code 1976, § 2½-12) 
                  Sec. 18-42. - Administrative agency. 
                  The zoning administrator is designated the administrative agency charged with the duty of administering and enforcing the regulations prescribed by this article. The duties of the zoning administrator shall include hearing and deciding all applications for permits.

Such return shall also show a figure putting the full-time equivalent employees for such part of a year on an annual basis, which figure shall bear the same ratio to the number of employees for such part year as the full year bears to such part year. Such figure shall be used as the estimate of the number of full-time equivalent employees of the business for the current calendar year. 
                  (d)  If any person fails to make a return, the city manager may make an estimate of the number of full-time equivalent employees of the business. The estimate shall be made for the period in respect to which the person failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is or may come into the possession of the city manager. 
                  (1)  The city manager or his designee shall give to the business operator written notice of his determination. The notice may be served personally or by mail; if by mail, such service shall be addressed to the business operator at his address as it appears in the records of the city manager. Service by mail is complete when such notice is delivered by certified mail with a receipt signed by the addressee.

                  (b)  If the amount of the occupation tax due for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section, and on the rate of the tax provided for in this article, exceeds the amount of occupation tax therefore paid by the business based on the estimate filed pursuant to section 26-50, the difference in the amounts shall be due and payable by the taxpayer to the city by January 31 of the current year and shall be delinquent if not paid on or before such date.

                  Sec. 42-33. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15), (16) and (17) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 42-33(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  i.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  ii.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  i.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  ii.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.

                  Sec. 42-34. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Pooler without first obtaining a permit from the soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control coordinator to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control coordinator and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 42-33(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection 42-33(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsection 42-33(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices.

                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsection 42-33(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 42-34(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 42-184.3. - Stormwater runoff reduction. 
                  The stormwater runoff volume generated by the runoff reduction storm event, as defined in the latest edition of the coastal stormwater supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, shall be reduced on-site in order to help maintain pre-development site hydrology and help protect local aquatic resources from several indirect impacts of the land development process, including decreased groundwater recharge, decreased baseflow and degraded water quality. A stormwater management system is presumed to comply with this criteria if: 
                  (1)  It includes green infrastructure practices that provide for the interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration or capture and reuse of stormwater runoff, that have been selected, designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the information presented in the latest edition of the coastal stormwater supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and any relevant local addenda; and, 
                  (2)  It is designed to provide the amount of stormwater runoff reduction specified in the latest edition of the coastal stormwater supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  The director may reduce the amount of stormwater runoff reduction needed to satisfy this criteria on development sites that are considered to be stormwater hotspots or that have site characteristics or constraints, such as high groundwater, impermeable soils, contaminated soils or confined groundwater aquifer recharge areas, that prevent the use of green infrastructure practices that provide for the interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration or capture and reuse of stormwater runoff. When seeking a reduction in the amount of stormwater runoff reduction that needs to be provided in order to satisfy this criteria, applicants shall: 
                  (1)  Use green infrastructure practices that provide for the interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration or capture and reuse of stormwater runoff, to provide the minimum amount of stormwater runoff reduction specified in the latest edition of the coastal stormwater supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and any relevant local addenda; and, 
                  (2)  Provide adequate documentation to the City of Pooler to show that no additional runoff reducing green infrastructure practices can be used on the development site. 
                  In accordance with section 42-184.4 of this article, any of the stormwater runoff volume generated by the runoff reduction storm event that is not reduced on the development site shall be intercepted and treated in one or more stormwater management practices that provide at least an 80 percent reduction in total suspended solids loads and that reduce nitrogen and bacteria loads to the maximum extent practical.

                  In order to protect local aquatic resources from water quality degradation, post-construction stormwater runoff shall be adequately treated before it is discharged from a development site. Applicants can satisfy this criteria by satisfying the stormwater runoff reduction criteria (section 42-184.3). However, if any of the stormwater runoff volume generated by the runoff reduction storm event, as defined in the latest edition of the coastal stormwater supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, cannot be reduced on the development site, due to site characteristics or constraints, it shall be intercepted and treated in one or more stormwater management practices that provide at least an 80 percent reduction in total suspended solids loads and that reduce nitrogen and bacteria loads to the maximum extent practical. When seeking to satisfy this criteria through the use of one or more stormwater management practices, applicants shall: 
                  (1)  Intercept and treat stormwater runoff in stormwater management practices that have been selected, designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the information presented in the latest edition of the coastal stormwater supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and any relevant local addenda; and, 
                  (2)  Provide adequate documentation to the City of Pooler to show that total suspended solids, nitrogen and bacteria removal were considered during the selection of the stormwater management practices that will be used to intercept and treat stormwater runoff on the development site.

                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Dec. 20, 2004, delete Art. VI, §§ 42-196—42-206, in its entirety and supplied provisions for a new Art. VI, §§ 42-196—42-207, to read as set out herein. Former Art. VI, §§ 42-196—42-206, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an ordinance adopted Jan. 4, 1999. 

                  Sec. 42-196. - Intent. 
                  (a)  The city deems it necessary and desirable in the interest of public health, safety and welfare to enact an ordinance for the preservation, planting and replacement of trees and to prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees and reduction of canopy cover within the city. It is the intent of this article that all site development, residential, commercial, and industrial, be undertaken with a survey of trees on the portion of land proposed for development and the final placement of the buildings, structures, roads, utilities and other features minimizes the removal of significant trees on the property and to recognize the importance in preserving, protecting and planting of trees for: 
                  (l)  Aiding in the prevention of erosion and sedimentation; 
                  (2)  Reducing storm water runoff; 
                  (3)  Aiding in removing carbon dioxide and other harmful contaminants; 
                  (4)  Generating oxygen into the atmosphere; and 
                  (5)  Enhancing the quality of life and welfare for current and future citizens of the city. 
                  (b)  Definitions. 
                  Buffer. Open space, landscaped areas, natural vegetation or undisturbed areas, fences, walls, berms, or any combination thereof used to physically separate or screen one use of property from another so as to visually shield lights or other nuisances. 
                  DBH. Diameter at breast height is a standard measure of tree size and is a tree trunk diameter measured in inches at a height of four and one-half feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one-half feet, then the trunk is measured at its most narrow point beneath the split. 
                  Preferred tree. See list of preferred trees in section 42-198. 
                  Significant tree. Any healthy tree, excluding pine trees and Sweet Gums, with a dbh of 24 inches or larger and Live Oaks with a dbh of 18 inches or larger. 
                  Tree fund. An account, maintained by the finance department of the city, of funds contributed from developers as a form of alternative compliance to the Pooler Tree Ordinance. Funds from the tree fund are to be used solely to fund tree planting and landscaping projects within the city as authorized by the public works director. 
                  Tree protection zone. The area surrounding a preserved or planted tree that is essential to that tree's health and survival, and is protected within the guidelines of this article.

                  Sec. 42-197. - Minimal tree coverage. 
                  (a)  Residential tree requirement—A residential lot shall have a minimum of three preferred trees, of which one shall be located in the front of the residence. All trees preserved on a residential lot must be protected and nurtured until final inspection and approval of improvements by the city building official. 
                  (b)  Multi-family, commercial and industrial requirement—The minimum allowable post development tree coverage for all development sites shall be 15 existing trees (excluding pine trees and Sweet Gums), eight-inch diameter at breast height (dbh) and larger per acre developable land (excluding buffers and wetlands). Each tree with a diameter of 24 inches dbh or larger (Live Oak with a dbh of 18 inches or larger) must be designated on the landscape plan and may count as five trees towards meeting the minimum allowable coverage. Each tree with a diameter of 36 inches dbh or larger (Live Oak with 30 inches dbh or larger) must also be designated on the landscape plan and may count as ten trees towards meeting the minimum allowable coverage. 
                  (Ord. of 12-20-2004, § 2) 
                  Sec. 42-198. - Significant trees. 
                  While all types of trees are protected under this article, special emphasis is placed on the preservation of large trees and certain more valued species listed in this section. The highest priority shall be given to the preservation of trees with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of 24 inches or larger (Live Oaks with 18 inches or larger), excluding pine trees or Sweet Gums. Removal of these valued trees can only be permitted by the city planning and zoning commission during the site and landscape plan review process. If a significant tree is to be removed, the planting of new trees of the same species, or preferred species if the same species is not available, totaling the same number of inches in diameter will be required. Replacement trees shall have a minimum dbh of six inches. 
                  (1)  Preferred tree list for residential development—American Holly, Birch, Cypress, Dogwood, Hickory, Live Oak, Magnolia, Maple, Pecan, Sycamore, Walnut, Willow, Drake Elm, Bosque Elm, and Alee Elm. 
                  (2)  Preferred tree list for multi-family, commercial, public institutional or industrial development—American Holly, Birch, Cypress, Hickory, Live Oak, Maple, Palm (greater or equal to eight-inch dbh), Sycamore, Walnut, Willow, Drake Elm, Bosque Elm, and Alee Elm. 
                  (Ord. of 12-20-2004, § 2) 
                  Sec. 42-199. - Replacement. 
                  If site design alternatives cannot achieve the minimum allowable existing tree coverage, or where pre-development tree coverage is less than the prescribed minimum, the developer will be required to plant the minimum required number of hardwood trees no less than two-inch dbh and a minimum height requirement of eight feet. The trees to be planted must be preferred hardwoods that conform to the American Standard for nursery stock. Planted or relocated trees should be appropriately placed so as to enhance the overall landscaping of the site. All trees planted or relocated on the site must be protected and nurtured until final inspection and approval of improvements by the city building official. 
                  (1)  Residential tree replacement. A residential lot shall have a minimum of three preferred trees, of which one shall be located in the front of the residence. All trees planted or relocated on a residential lot must be protected and nurtured until final inspection and approval of improvements by the city building official. 
                  (2)  Multi-family, commercial and industrial tree replacement. Any tree required to meet minimum tree coverage requirements that is lost after 12 months of final approval by the city building official shall be replaced with a two and one-half-inch dbh tree of the same type. If a significant tree is lost subsequent to development and before final inspection by the city building official, it shall be replaced according to this section. 
                  (3)  Commercial and industrial hardship alternative. Based on the type of development proposed, the planning and zoning commission may provide an option to the developer which enables him to provide less than the required tree coverage. If the provision is granted, the developer would be required to monetarily reimburse the city for the unused trees. For each unused tree, the reimbursement should equal 100 percent of the value of a healthy Live Oak with dbh of two inches. This would not apply to significant tree replacement. The city will in turn use the money to fund tree planting and landscaping projects on city property.

                  Protection zones should be established and maintained for each tree preserved on a development site. The area within the tree protection zone must be open and unpaved, except where approved pervious pavers may be utilized or tree aeration systems and tree wells are installed. Building materials, vehicles or tools are not permitted to be stored in such protection zones. The protection zone is defined as a circle with a radius of one foot per one-inch dbh extending outwardly from the tree to be protected or the extent of the drip line, which ever is more restrictive. The protective barrier must not be less than four feet in height, be prominent visually and erected completely around the protection zone. The use of orange polyethylene safety fencing or a similar material is required as a minimum. The barrier must remain in place until the developer has been given permission to take it down by the city building official. Underground utility lines shall be routed around and away from tree protection zones. Necessary installation through protection zones shall be accomplished through tunneling rather than cutting open trenches which sever tree roots. Those trees designated for preservation as shown on the approved landscape plan or development site plan shall be marked on-site with a bright blue ribbon encircling the trunks of each tree. The construction plan must clearly state the purpose and reasoning for the blue ribbons to prevent any confusion at the site.

                  (a)  When assessment required. This section is intended to provide applicants for a building permit or a demolition permit with notices when the proposed activity may require a department of the army permit due to impact upon jurisdictional wetlands. The provision in subsection (b) of this section shall not apply if the applicant can provide to the building official a valid U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wetland delineation that verifies that the proposed activity is not located within a jurisdictional wetlands, or if the applicant can provide a valid U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit or letter that authorizes the proposed activity within jurisdictional wetlands. If such evidence of compliance with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permitting requirements is provided, the building official shall follow normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit. 
                  (b)  Assessment. Prior to the issuance of a building permit or a demolition permit, the building official shall assess whether the proposed activity is of the type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands and, if so, shall also assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area. To assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet ofa wetland inventory area, the building official shall consult the then current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency West Chatham County ADID Map of Wetlands and Uplands. If the proposed activity is not located within the study area defined on the ADID map, the building official shall consult the then current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) Map for the county. 
                  (1)  If the building official determines that the proposed activity is of a type that is not likely to result in a disturbance of wetlands or that it does not fall within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, the building official shall follow normal procedures for issuing a building or demolition permit. 
                  (2)  If the building official determines that the proposed activity is of a type that is likely to result in a disturbance of wetlands and the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional wetland determination shall be required prior to issuance of a building or demolition permit. 
                  a.  If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that a department of the army permit is required, a building permit or a demolition permit shall be issued only following issuance of the U.S. Department of the Army permit. 
                  b.  If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that the proposed activity would not require a U.S. Department of the Army permit, the building official shall proceed with normal procedures for issuing a building or demolition permit. 
                  (c)  Effect of assessment. Wetland inventory areas do not necessarily represent jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetlands delineation. No permit issued by the city relieves a landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 50-31. - Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of Pooler, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 8-5-2013(2) , § II) 
                  Sec. 50-32. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and, 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 8-5-2013(2) , § II) 
                  Sec. 50-33. - Objectives.

                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and, 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Existing construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before September 30, 1981. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before September 30, 1981. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.

                  Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damaged occurred. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any article requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. Note: The market value of the structure should be: 
                  (1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  (2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include: 
                  (1)  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  (2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 "Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 50-91. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater: 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  (i)  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  (ii)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and, 
                  (iii)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable State requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 50-92. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 50-92(3)(a), (c) "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 50-67(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels, 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. section 50-91(6), 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of section 50-92(3)(a), (c) above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-36, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. 
                  Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)(a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3.

                  Sec. 50-93. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-36, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 50-36, then the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a Limited Detail Study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 50-91(4) "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Sec. 50-94. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-36 may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 50-91(4) "elevated buildings". 
                  The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 50-68(1) and section 50-68(2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 50-97. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The city council as established by the Charter shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Chatham County, as provided in section 5-4-1 of the O.C.G.A. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  (a)  Statement of legislative purpose. 
                  (1)  The city council recognizes that signs provide an important medium through which individuals, businesses, and government may convey a variety of messages. However, left unregulated, signs can become a threat to the public health and safety as a traffic hazard, as a detriment to property values, and as an aesthetic nuisance affecting the overall economic growth of the city. Numerous professional studies have been prepared that examine and establish the effect of signs on traffic safety, aesthetics and economic prosperity, including the following:

                  (2)  Based on a review of the cited materials and the studies referenced therein as well as other related studies, the city council finds that unregulated signs: 
                  a.  Can be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians; 
                  b.  Can be a detriment to the public health; 
                  c.  Can hamper economic growth; 
                  d.  Can lower property values; 
                  e.  Can adversely impact public investments; 
                  f.  Can degrade the utility of public safety signs; and 
                  g.  Can adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment. 
                  (b)  Findings of fact. The city council finds that: 
                  (1)  Signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. However, an improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public; 
                  (2)  The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrians and vehicular traffic; 
                  (3)  Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to an attractive, orderly and safely designed business environment; 
                  (4)  Through proper regulation of signs, the aesthetic attractiveness and economic well-being of the city will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business; 
                  (5)  Concerns about aesthetic and safety issues as balanced with concerns about freedom of expression or speech are reasonably promoted in the city by the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of these sign regulations are: 
                  (1)  To aid in the identification of businesses and other commercial establishments in the city for police, fire and other emergency responses, and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies; 
                  (2)  To protect the public health, morals and welfare from the display of obscene language, nudity and the advertisement of illegal activities, as defined in state law. 
                  (3)  To promote the mental and physical health, safety and welfare of the public by providing for the orderly and harmonious display of signs within the community; 
                  (4)  To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment by minimizing visual clutter, encouraging a positive visual environment, and avoiding the erection of displays which could produce deleterious and injurious effects to adjacent properties and to the natural beauty of the environment; 
                  (5)  To provide for the safety of the traveling public, both vehicular and pedestrian, by limiting distractions, hazards, and obstructions; 
                  (6)  To promote the use of outdoor advertising adjacent to interstate highways within the jurisdictional limits of the city, consistent with the other purposes of this chapter; 
                  (7)  To maintain the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth and to aid in the identification of properties and enterprises for the convenience of the public; and, 
                  (8)  To encourage the effective use of signs as a means for communication in the city by allowing the maximum amount of expression or speech consistent with the compatibility of such expression or speech with other land uses and with the aesthetic and public health, safety and welfare concerns which the city is charged by law and the Georgia Constitution to preserve and protect. 
                  (d)  Variances. It is further the intent of these sign regulations that variances from the provisions herein not be considered or approved except under extraordinary circumstances in accordance with the findings of fact enumerated under Sec. 66-11(b), as determined by the city council.

                  (Ord. of 6-15-2015 , § II) 
                  Sec. 66-4. - Requirements that apply to all signs in general. 
                  (a)  Compliance with other codes, laws and regulations. 
                  (1)  Any sign that will be erected, replaced, reconstructed, repaired, altered, relocated or maintained within the city shall conform to the requirements of the International Building Code, Appendix H, and to the requirements of the National Electrical Code, Chapter 600, "Electrical Signs and Outdoor Lighting", as adopted with amendments by the State of Georgia. 
                  (2)  In accordance with the National Electrical Code specifications, all signs shall be located in such a way that they maintain horizontal and vertical clearance from all overhead utilities. In no case shall any sign be installed within three feet horizontally or vertically from any overhead utility line or utility guy wire. 
                  (3)  Any sign that will be erected, replaced, reconstructed, repaired, altered or relocated within the city shall conform to all other provisions of this chapter and other ordinances of the City of Pooler. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and other city ordinances or adopted regulations, the most stringent requirements shall prevail and be controlling. 
                  (4)  Wind pressure. 
                  a.  Freestanding signs shall be capable of withstanding horizontal wind pressure amounting to 30 pounds per square foot. In assuming or determining the pressure on any sign, the wind shall be assumed to be blowing from the direction which will produce the maximum stress. 
                  b.  All signs that are newly erected, replaced, reconstructed, repaired, altered or relocated within the city having an area of greater than 35 square feet shall be designed to withstand a wind load created by a 120 miles per hour wind. 
                  (5)  All signs shall conform with all state requirements including, but not limited to, signs used by retail distilled spirits dealers, signs advertising Georgia Lottery, O.C.G.A. § 3-4-3; control of signs and signals, O.C.G.A. § 32-6-50 et seq.; unlawful placement of signs within right-of-way of public road, O.C.G.A. § 32-6-51.

                  (b)  Computation of sign face area. 
                  (1)  Generally. 
                  a.  The area of a sign face or module shall be that of the smallest rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the portion of the sign structure on which is located the sign copy and the background upon which the sign copy is placed. The sign face area does not include any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
                  b.  If a sign face is composed of two or more sign modules separated one from another, the sign face area shall be the area of each module, measured in accordance with the preceding paragraph a, totaled together. 
                  c.  The following are examples of how sign face area measurements are made; the signs shown are illustrative and only provided for clarity. 

                  (2)  Area of multi-faced signs. The sign face area of a single sign structure with more than one side shall be computed as follows: 
                  a.  Signs with three or more faces. 
                  1.  For sign structures having only three sides and the interior angle formed between each of the sides is 60 degrees: while sign faces may be located on all sides, the sign face area shall be taken as the area of the largest sign face on the structure. 
                  2.  For all other multi-faced signs with three or more sides, the sign face area shall be either the largest sign on the structure, or the largest total of all sign faces that are joined by an interior angle of more than 60 degrees. 
                  b.  Double-faced signs. For double-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel (back-to-back), or where the smallest angle formed between the two faces is 60 degrees or less, the area of the sign face shall be taken as the area of the largest side. For double-faced signs where the interior angle formed by the faces is more than 60 degrees, the sign face area shall be the total area on both sides. 

                  (3)  Area of free-form signs. For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all of the sign's words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors or other design elements shall establish the area of the sign face. 

                  (4)  Kiosks. For a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be the largest measurement achieved from any view of the sign structure. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on or bisecting the sign structure. 
                  (c)  Height measurements. 
                  (1)  For a freestanding sign structure located within 100 feet of an adjacent street right-of-way (as measured perpendicular to the street), the following applies: 
                  a.  For a sign located on land at or above the crown of the roadway in the adjacent street, the height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the average grade at the base of the sign to the highest point of any portion of the sign. Any earthen berms or other site improvements that raise the sign above the pre-construction natural grade of the land upon which the sign is placed shall be included in the height measurement of the sign. 
                  b.  For a sign located on land below the crown of the roadway in the adjacent street, the height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the crown of the roadway to the highest point of any portion of the sign. Any earthen berms, elevated foundations or other site improvements that raise the sign up to the level of the crown of the roadway shall not be included in the height measurement of the sign. 
                  (2)  For a freestanding sign structure located 100 feet or more from an adjacent street right-of-way (as measured perpendicular to the street), the height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the average grade at the base of the sign to the highest point of any portion of the sign. Any earthen berms or other site improvements that raise the sign above the preconstruction natural grade of the land upon which the sign is placed shall be included in the height measurement of the sign. 

                  (d)  Lighting restrictions. In addition to illuminated signs that are prohibited under subsection 66-3(c), the following applies to all illumination of signs: 
                  (1)  Only permanent signs shall be illuminated, either internally or externally. 
                  (2)  A permit will not be issued for an illuminated sign on a nonresidential property within 100 feet from any property line of a residentially zoned parcel. 
                  (3)  In a residential zoning district only project entrance signs may be illuminated, and such signs may only be illuminated by an external light source, such as floodlights or shielded neon tubes. 
                  (4)  Any signage with internal lighting composed of light bulbs or neon tubing shall be covered so that the light sources are not directly visible from the outside. 
                  (e)  Construction and maintenance. 
                  (1)  All signs shall be constructed and maintained in conformance with the Pooler Building Code. 
                  (2)  The city may, at its discretion, require certification to confirm that the structural requirements of the city's codes are met. 
                  (3)  All signs, together with their supports, braces, guys and anchors, shall be kept in good repair and unless constructed of galvanized or non-corroding metal, shall be given a protective coating as necessary to maintain a clean appearance and safe condition. 
                  (f)  Language and legibility. 
                  (1)  Every principal freestanding sign shall contain the street number in Arabic numbers of a size no less than required by city ordinance or code. 
                  (2)  To aid in proper and timely response in an emergency, the name of the business or the type of business on the premises must also be indicated in English using lettering no smaller than required for street numbers. 
                  (3)  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the same and/or additional information on the sign from being written in a language other than English, provided that an English translation of the sign is included with the application for a sign permit in accordance with subsection 66-10(c)(5). 
                  (g)  Vertical clearance. Any sign, including a flag mounted on a flagpole, that projects over an automobile driveway or parking area, or over a sidewalk or other area of pedestrian movement, must provide a minimum vertical clearance of eight feet above the ground. Signs projecting over a truck access drive or parking area must provide a minimum vertical clearance of 14 feet above the ground. 
                  (h)  Visibility clearance area. 
                  (1)  No sign more than three feet in height shall be erected within 30 feet of an intersection with a public or private street, private drive or other access point, or otherwise interfere with traffic movement and visibility. 
                  (2)  Such visibility clearance area shall be established as the triangular area formed by the street right-of-way lines (or such lines extended to their intersection) and a line connecting such right-of-way lines at points 30 feet from the intersection of the right-of-way lines, or within 30 feet of the intersection of a street right-of-way line and the edge of a driveway.

                  (b)  Findings of fact. A variance from the application of the provisions of this chapter may be granted by the city council only if all of the following findings are made: 
                  (1)  That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions peculiar to the particular property, such as but not limited to irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of the lot size or shape, or an unusual degree or type of development proposed on the property, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions; and, 
                  (2)  That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, signage cannot be erected in strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter without undue hardship to the property owner; and, 
                  (3)  That granting the variance will not result in authorization of a type of sign not otherwise allowed on the property; and, 
                  (4)  That granting the variance will not cause substantial detriment to the public good. 
                  (c)  Procedures. The procedure for consideration of a sign variance shall be the same as for zoning variances specifically described in the Pooler Zoning Ordinance under article V, procedures for administration and enforcement, as follows: 
                  (1)  An application for a sign variance shall include all required and pertinent information required in the zoning ordinance pertaining to applications in general and specifically to zoning variances under sections 4(A) and 4(D) of article V. 
                  (2)  Public notice shall be given in the same manner and timing as for zoning actions under section 5 of article V of the zoning ordinance. 
                  (3)  Public hearings shall be held by the planning commission and the city council as required in the zoning ordinance for a zoning decision under section 6 of article V. 
                  (d)  Conditional approval. In granting any sign variance, the city council may impose appropriate conditions of approval which it deems necessary in order to make the requested action acceptable and consistent with the purposes of this chapter, to ameliorate negative issues identified through evaluation of the variance request, or to further the goals and objectives of any plans adopted by the city. Violation of such conditions of approval, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter subject to enforcement under the provisions of section 66-13. 
                  (e)  Longevity. After a sign variance has been granted by the city council it shall be valid for a period of 12 months from the date of approval, within which time a complete and proper application for a sign permit must be received and accepted in accordance with subsection 66-10(c). The sign permit may only be granted for plans consistent with the variance approval and all other applicable requirements of this chapter. Any deviation from the variance as approved will require separate approval by the city council. 
                  (f)  Waiting period if denied. No application for a sign variance that has been previously denied by the city council shall be accepted until the expiration of at least 12 months immediately following the denial by the city council of such sign variance request. However, if the sign variance request is for a lesser relaxation of the standards or for a different request, then an application may be submitted. 
                  (g)  Withdrawal. Any appellant wishing to withdraw a sign variance application prior to final action on the application shall file a written request for withdrawal with the zoning administrator. 
                  (1)  The withdrawal request must be in writing and signed by the owner, the appellant or the owner's authorized agent. 
                  (2)  If the request for withdrawal is received prior to the publication of public notice for the first public hearing, the application shall be withdrawn administratively by the zoning administrator. 
                  (3)  If a request for withdrawal of the application is received after public notice has been published (or irretrievably set for publication) for the first public hearing, the application may be withdrawn without prejudice at the public hearing with the consent of the planning commission and removed from further consideration. The application may be refiled without regard to the waiting period provisions in subsection 66-11(f). 
                  (4)  If the planning commission does not consent to the withdrawal of the application, the city council may take such action as it deems appropriate, including approval, denial or withdrawal with prejudice. An application that is denied or withdrawn with prejudice shall comply with the waiting period provisions of subsection 66-11(f).

                  Sec. 66-12. - Nonconforming signs. 
                  Any sign that was legally in existence on the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto, and became nonconforming with respect to the requirements of this chapter or any amendments thereto, may continue in existence as long as the size of the sign is not increased beyond its existing size on the effective date of this chapter, and any change to the sign is made in conformance with this chapter. 
                  (a)  Nonconforming signs—Burden of proof. 
                  (1)  The burden of proof that an existing sign qualifies as a legal nonconforming sign lies with the owner of the sign. Lacking such proof, the sign may be determined to be an illegal nonconforming sign and its removal required. 
                  (2)  Signs for which documentation exists that the sign was erected in conformance with the city's requirements and regulations are considered "legal" nonconforming signs. 
                  (b)  Nonconforming signs; provisions. 
                  (1)  A legal nonconforming sign shall not be replaced, enlarged, or structurally altered except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (2)  The substitution or interchange of sign copy, poster panels or painted boards on legal nonconforming signs shall be allowed provided the size, shape or location of said sign does not change. The installation of a new or larger electronic changeable copy sign is considered a structural alteration and is not allowed. 
                  (3)  Repair and maintenance of legal nonconforming signs may be performed as necessary unless more than 50 percent of the sign is repaired, altered, or replaced, as determined by the zoning administrator. If more than 50 percent of the sign is affected, then any legal nonconforming status is lost and the sign must be brought into compliance with the current sign regulations; provided that signs damaged by fire or act of God may be restored to their original condition. 
                  (c)  Relocation of a nonconforming sign. 
                  (1)  An existing sign that was legally erected and that becomes nonconforming as to the setback requirements of the city due to road widening may be moved to meet the setback requirements of this chapter. Such sign shall not be increased in size or changed in any manner except as to become conforming. 
                  (2)  Any sign erected to replace a legal nonconforming sign must meet all requirements and provisions of this chapter. 
                  (Ord. of 6-15-2015 , § II) 
                  Sec. 66-13. - Administration, enforcement, and penalties. 
                  (a)  Enforcement. 
                  (1)  All of the provisions of this chapter shall be administered by the zoning administrator, including the rendering of interpretations as to the requirements of this chapter, and enforced by the building inspections department whose duties shall include: issuing sign and related building permits, inspecting signs, and enforcement of all provisions of this chapter. 
                  (2)  All questions arising in connection with the administration and interpretation of this chapter shall be presented first to the zoning administrator and then to the city council on appeal of a decision from the zoning administrator. 
                  (3)  A sign permit may be revoked by the building inspections department, if it is found not to be in compliance with this chapter due to intentional misinformation, misrepresentation, or significant error on the sign permit application. 
                  (4)  Issuance of a sign permit in no way prevents the building inspections department from later declaring the sign to be nonconforming or unlawful if upon further review of available information the sign is found not to comply with the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Inspections. 
                  (1)  The building official shall inspect or cause to be inspected, by a duly authorized representative, every sign, after issuance of a sign permit, during or upon its installation in order to determine that each such sign meets the requirements set forth in this chapter. Inspections shall include but are not limited to, footings and electrical wiring. 
                  (2)  It shall be the duty of the building official or a duly authorized representative to notify the sign contractor (if known) and the sign owner or property owner, of any discrepancies or violations found during the sign inspection. This notice shall be in writing and provide the specifics as to the discrepancies or violations found during the inspection and may be served in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
                  (3)  All deficiencies or violations shall be corrected, within 48 hours, following service of this notice by the building official or a duly authorized representative. The building official or a duly authorized representative may extend the time limit to correct the violation no more than seven days or reduce the limit no less than 24 hours. 
                  (4)  The building official or a duly authorized representative is herein authorized to enter private property for the purpose of making an inspection to insure compliance with all provisions of this chapter. 
                  (5)  The building official or a duly authorized representative shall have the authority to cause to be removed after due notice any sign which shows gross neglect or becomes dilapidated by giving the owner ten days written notice to correct the deficiencies or to remove the sign(s). If the owner refuses to comply, the building official or a duly authorized representative shall have the authority to have said sign(s) removed at the expense of the owner. 
                  (c)  Abandoned signs. 
                  (1)  If a building, structure or premise is vacated, any associated temporary signs shall be removed by the property owner or the sign owner within ten days, following service of notice by the building official or a duly authorized representative. If the property owner or sign owner fails to comply within ten days after written notification, the building official or a duly authorized representative may cause the removal of the sign at the property owner's or sign owner's expense. 
                  (2)  If a nonconforming sign or sign structure has not been in use whereby the property has been vacated for a period of three months or longer and the sign has not been updated to convey a current message, any such sign on the property, building, or structure loses its legal nonconforming status and must be removed or brought into compliance with the current sign regulations. 
                  (d)  Administrative fees, citations and penalties. 
                  (1)  The city's code enforcement officer and any other sworn officer of the City of Pooler is hereby empowered to issue a citation for violation of this chapter in any case where it is found that a sign has been erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted or maintained in violation of any provision of this chapter. Temporary event signs still erected after the expiration date of the approved sign permit shall be removed by the owner/applicant or a citation will be issued for violation of this chapter. 
                  (2)  Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in section 1-12 of the city's code of ordinances. 
                  (Ord. of 6-15-2015 , § II) 
                  Sec. 66-14. - Intent, interpretation and severability. 
                  (a)  In interpreting the provisions of this chapter, nothing shall be construed as intent to regulate the content of the message displayed on any sign. 
                  (b)  All signs may display a non-commercial message constituting personal speech in addition to or in lieu of any other message. It is the intent of this chapter to regulate only the number, type, size, height, timing, appearance and location of signs to accomplish the purposes set forth in section 66-1 of this chapter, except as otherwise provided herein. 
                  (c)  In the event any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional including, but not limited to, a declaration or adjudication that such section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of the chapter relates to the content of any sign or in any way violates the constitutional provisions of free speech under the State of Georgia or United States Constitution, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the other sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases of this chapter, which shall remain in full force and effect as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase so declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part thereof. The city council hereby declares it would have adopted the remaining parts of the chapter if it had known that such part or parts thereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional. The provisions of this chapter are declared severable to the maximum extent allowed by law.

In such event, the wheeled container and other refuse shall be picked up at the place on the premises where the wheeled container is maintained by the occupant. 
                  (2)  The superintendent of sanitation may establish exceptions for designated premises which he finds to be unsuitable for curbside pickup, taking into consideration the terrain features or other physical impediments, and at such premises, pickup service shall continue to be provided to such dwelling unit at another location determined by the superintendent of sanitation.

                  (a)  Storm drainpipe beneath pavement shall be minimum 18 inch concrete pipe unless a smaller size is approved by the city. 
                  (b)  Storm side-drain under driveways and walkways shall be minimum 15 inch diameter pipe. Plastic culverts shall have concrete headwalls to protect the pipe ends. However, in cases where there is less than 21 inches from the top of the traffic service on the driveway to the bottom of the ditch, the city has the right to reduce the size of this culvert pipe to such size as is, in their best judgement, adequate to fulfill the purpose of the drain. 
                  (c)  Metal pipe is not permitted as cross drains under pavement or in the city's rights-of-way or easements. 
                  (d)  Lot drainage shall be from the rear to the front of lots to eliminate rear lot ditches and swales. Exceptions will be considered when this requirement is not possible to accomplish due to existing ground elevations. Lot grades of one-half percent minimum are acceptable. 
                  (e)  Side lot drainage shall be piped; ditches on side lot lines are not permitted, unless specifically agreed to by the city. If ditches are allowed, they shall be placed in a right-of-way or nonencroachable easement large enough to accommodate the ditch plus a 25 foot access on one side. 
                  (f)  Rear lot drainage ditches and canals, new or existing, shall be piped or placed in a right-of-way of sufficient width to be maintained by mechanical equipment. Minimum drainage rights-of-way shall be the width of the ditch or canal plus 25 feet for equipment operation. A permanent stand of grass shall be established on both slopes and equipment area. Rights-of-way lines shall be parallel and changed in increments of five feet or ten feet. The developer shall provide the necessary canal right-of-way. Ditches or canals shall have a minimum sideslope of two to one.

Four to one is four feet horizontal of each one foot vertical. A permanent stand of grass shall be established on both slopes. A swale is a drainage feature that receives stormwater from sheet flow and/or overland flow. Storm drainage pipe or gutter flow shall ont discharge into a swale. A drainage swale or ditch greater than three feet deep shall be piped unless it is a primary or secondary outfall. 
                  (h)  Ditch bank side slopes shall be constructed in such a manner that they will not erode and can be maintained with riding grass cutting equipment. The type of soil encountered will be considered in selecting the proper slope. Slope approval shall be at the discretion of the city, with a laboratory report on the angle of repose. 
                  (i)  Drainage calculations shall be submitted along with preliminary plans for review; internal subdivision drainage to be designed for a minimum of a ten-year storm with immediate runoff. Calculations shall include a rating showing the maximum water elevations at each structure for the year storm. 
                  (j)  Floodplain elevation for 100-year storm will be shown on drainage plan. 
                  (k)  Outfall drainage shall be designed for a ten-year storm. The peak post development discharge shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge for the property under construction. This will necessitate stormwater detention on most projects. If the existing outfall does not have the capacity to adequately pass the ten-year storm, then the allowable discharge for the outfall will be a prorated share of the available capacity based on acreage. The city will not be responsible for maintenance of any detention area nor will the city accept such for ownership. Maintenance and liability will remain with the developer or the designated successors, who shall be named prior to final plat approval.

The amount of tax so remitted shall be credited against the amount to be due with the regular return for the monthly period to be filed on the 20th day of the succeeding month.

A lodging provider granted an extension shall remit tax equaling not less than 100 percent of the tax paid for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year; such remittance to be made on or before the date the tax would otherwise come due without the grant of extension. No penalty or interest shall be charged during the first ten days of the extension period. Thereafter, interest shall be collected on the unpaid balance at the rate of one percent per month. 
                  (h)  Collection fee allowed lodging providers.

                  Sec. 80-6. - Additional standards. 
                  To ensure compatibility with surrounding land uses, protect public safety and natural, cultural and scenic resources and preserve and enhance the character of neighborhoods, all WTFs subject to this article shall be located, developed and operated in compliance with the following: 
                  (1)  Siting and location. 
                  a.  Siting. WTFs are allowed in all zoning districts, subject to the limitation set forth herein. Siting of WTFs shall be in accordance with a hierarchy of facility alternatives. If a WTF is proposed that is a lower-ranking facility than the most preferred facility type (concealed attached), an evidence of need report as specified in section 80-5 shall be provided. Whenever feasible, a new facility, not to include collocation or combined antennas, should be located on city property to ensure that regular maintenance of the facility, as required by section 80-8, is occurring. 

                   
                  B means "By Right" 
                  CUP means "Conditional Use Permit" 
                  * Means "Permitted on utility distribution poles and light stanchions only" 
                  ** Means as allowed by PUD Master Plan 

                  1.  An applicant does not have to provide a concealed attached facility if collocation on an existing antenna support structure or other structure (i.e., athletic field light pole or water tank) is available within the applicant's geographic search area provided that the structure is not located within a residential district, recognized historic area or within the scenic vistas/landscapes identified in subsection (8) unless approved by the city council after recommendation by the planning and zoning commission. 
                  2.  May be allowed within a recognized historic area with city council approval, but not on a contributing structure. 
                  3.  Not allowed within a residential district, a recognized historic area or within 100 feet of either. A setback waiver may be requested if the criteria in subsection (8)c can be met. 
                  (2)  Height. 
                  a.  General. Height shall be measured in above ground level (AGL). 
                  b.  Height, maximum. 

                   
                  c.  Height, flexibility. The city council after recommendation by the planning and zoning commission may approve additional height beyond the maximum allowed if findings can be made that siting of the proposed WTF is appropriate to the context of the proposed location using the criteria listed in subsection (4). 
                  (3)  Setbacks. All WTFs and their equipment enclosures and ancillary structures shall comply with the setback provisions of the zoning district in which the WTF is located. In addition, the following setbacks shall be observed: 
                  a.  Setbacks required. 
                  1.  In order to ensure public safety, the minimum distance from the base of any nonconcealed freestanding WTF to any property line, road, dwelling, commercial or institutional use or public recreational area shall be the height of the antenna support structure, including any antennas or other appurtenances, if the WTF has not been constructed with breakpoint design technology. 
                  The setback may be reduced by the city council after recommendation by the planning and zoning commission if documentation filed by a Georgia-licensed professional structural engineer certifies that the WTF utilizes breakpoint design technology. The minimum setback shall be equal to 110 percent of the distance from the top of the structure to the breakpoint level of the structure, plus the minimum setback distance of the zoning district. For example, a nonconcealed WTF of 100 feet in height with a breakpoint at 80 feet, the minimum setback would be 22 feet (110 percent of 20 feet-the distance from the top of the WTF) plus the minimum setback for the zoning district. 
                  2.  The city council after recommendation by the planning and zoning commission may waive all or part of a required setback if the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed facility will be the least visually obtrusive profile, will not detract from the beauty and/or character of the area in which the WTF is proposed, and will not cause a public safety issue. 
                  3.  Setbacks from residential districts, recognized historic areas, and certain scenic vistas and landscapes for nonconcealed freestanding WTFs, as described in subsection (8), are also required. If more than one standard applies, the more restrictive standard shall govern. 
                  4.  All accessory buildings and ancillary equipment shall comply with all City of Pooler Zoning and Building requirements and fire safety codes. 
                  b.  Setback not required. A setback may not be required by this article for concealed freestanding and attached WTFs. However, the setback provisions of the zoning district shall apply. In the case of pre-existing nonconforming structures, a WTF (including its equipment compound and/or cabinetry and ancillary structures) shall not increase any non-conformities, except as provided in section 80-10. 
                  (4)  Aesthetics/visibility. To protect the beauty and character of the city, particularly residential districts, recognized historic areas and certain scenic vistas and landscapes as identified herein, all facilities shall be screened to the greatest extent possible. Screening shall occur through the use of design, existing buildings and structures, existing and proposed vegetation, appropriate materials and color. Unlike nonconcealed facilities, concealed facilities shall not be identifiable as a WTF. 

                   
                  (5)  Equipment compound and/or equipment cabinetry. Equipment related to the operation of a WTF shall be hidden and/or screened from public view by one or more of the following techniques, which shall also be consistent with the aesthetic/visibility standards identified in subsection (4): 
                  a.  Ground equipment, including platforms. One or more of the following techniques can be used to hide and /or screen equipment: 
                  1.  Locate equipment underground. If a nonconcealed freestanding WTF is proposed, an opaque security barrier consisting of brick, masonry, or other material approved by city council after recommendation by the planning and zoning commission shall be installed around the antenna support structure that will prevent unauthorized access to the structure. Landscaping as identified in subsection (4) shall be provided. 
                  2.  Locate equipment within a building. The building shall be designed to be consistent with the prevailing architectural style of the neighborhood in which it is located, including exterior materials and roof pitch. The enclosure shall not exceed one story, unless location in a flood plain or other drainage concerns requires it to be elevated. 
                  3.  Locate equipment behind a secured, landscaped perimeter. An evergreen landscape buffer shall surround the perimeter of the WTF. If this method is selected, the buffer requirements identified in subsection (4) apply. Additionally, an opaque fence (chain link with slats or webbing is not considered opaque) or masonry wall as approved by city council after recommendation by the planning and zoning commission shall be constructed to minimize opportunities for unauthorized access, climbing, vandalism, graffiti and other conditions that would result in hazardous conditions, visual blight and attractive nuisances. The fence or wall shall be no less than the above grade height of any equipment within the enclosure, which shall not be taller than one story, unless located in a flood zone. All fencing shall be secured with a Knox Lock to allow public safety access in the event of a natural hazard or other similar type emergency. 
                  b.  Roof-top equipment. Equipment shall be screened from public view in a manner that is consistent with the architectural style of the building upon which the WTF is located. 
                  (6)  Lighting and signage. 
                  a.  Wireless telecommunications facilities taller than 199 feet AGL shall be lit according to FAA standards including light intensity and flashes per minutes. When applicable, dual lighting systems shall be employed. This dual lighting system includes red lights (L-864) for nighttime and medium intensity flashing white lights (L-865) for daytime and twilight use. This lighting system may be used in lieu of operating a medium intensity flashing white light system at night. 
                  b.  Free-standing wireless telecommunications facilities between 100 and 199 feet AGL shall be equipped with: 
                  1.  Red lights (L-864) for nighttime (only)—Strobe lighting of any kind is not permitted; and, 
                  2.  White reflective tape/sheeting installed at 20 feet above ground level and continuing upward at ten foot intervals. 
                  c.  Lighting of equipment enclosures and other ancillary structures on site shall be shielded from adjacent properties. The footcandle measurement at property lines shall be no more than 1.0 footcandle when measured at grade. FAA required lighting is exempt from this requirement. 
                  d.  Signs shall be limited to those needed to identify the WTF, the owner, the party responsible for the operation and maintenance (including address and telephone number), to warn of danger and to comply with applicable federal regulations. Such signage shall be visible and legible at ground level. 
                  (7)  Recognized historic areas. 
                  a.  Freestanding WTFs within a recognized historic area shall be concealed. Attached WTFs proposed for existing structures shall also be concealed unless it can be demonstrated that the facility will not be visible from ground level. 
                  b.  Any WTF located on or within an historic building or structure shall not alter the character-defining features, distinctive construction methods or original historic materials of the building or structure. 
                  (8)  Scenic vistas and landscapes. To preserve scenic vistas and landscapes, any nonconcealed freestanding WTF shall: 
                  a.  Not be developed within the scenic viewshed of the Savannah/Ogeechee Canal. 
                  b.  Be separated from the following areas by the following distances: 
                  1.  Residential districts, recognized historic areas: 100 feet. 
                  2.  Public rights-of-way: 100 feet.

"Physically remove" shall include, but not be limited to removal of antennas, antenna support structures, equipment shelters and an associated materials from the subject property, where applicable. Physically remove shall also include restoration of the location of the WTF to its natural condition, where applicable, except that any landscaping and grading shall remain in post-development condition. 
                  (e)  Upon a determination of abandonment by the city manager or his or her designee pursuant to this section, and the failure of the WTF owner or other co-applicant to remove the facility in accordance with this article, the facility and related structures shall be deemed unfit for use and in violation of the permit requirements so as to be deemed a danger to public health and a public and private nuisance. Failure of the WTF owner or other co-applicant to dismantle and physically remove the facility and related structures in accordance with the terms of this article shall authorize the city to do so in order to abate the nuisance and/or ensure compliance with this article. The dismantling and the physical removal of such abandoned WTFs is the responsibility of the WTF owner and other co-applicants and shall become a lien upon the property. If the cost of such dismantling and physical removal is bourne by the city, the cost therefore shall be charged to the WTF owner and all co-applicants. The city shall have the authority to enforce the collection of the charges associated with the dismantling and physical removal of abandoned WTFs by any and all means provided by law when such charges are due and remain unpaid for a period of 30 days.

Any person who operates motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by any State of Georgia law or this chapter as a condition of operating motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on the roads of the City of Pooler.

                  Derelict motor vehicle means a motor vehicle which is not an abandoned vehicle and/or any part thereof as defined in O.C.G.A. § 40-11-1(1)(A) which is incapable of being moved under its own power and has had one or more of the major parts for its safe operation removed or destroyed, and has no value other than nominal salvage value, provided, that this definition shall not apply to any motor vehicle or part thereof which shall be located within the premises of any junkyard complying with the laws of the state relating to the licensing and regulating of motor vehicle junkyards. Whenever the word "vehicle" is used in this article, it shall refer to a derelict motor vehicle as defined in this section. 
                  Owner means any person, firm, corporation or other entity which is named as owning a derelict motor vehicle and/or having any security interest therein, or lienholder, or other interest as reflected according to any certificate of title for such vehicle issued by any department or agency of a state having authority to issue such certificate, provided, that if no such certificate has been issued by a state or if none is available, nor can be obtained, the information indicating ownership as provided on the vehicle license registration shall be sufficient, and provided, that if with reasonable diligence the information contained on the title certificate and the vehicle license registration cannot be obtained, the owner of a vehicle shall be considered unknown.

                  Sec. 82-73. - Duties of city employees. 
                  (a)  The city manager is authorized to designate such city employees as are necessary to identify derelict motor vehicles and cause the removal and disposal of such vehicles; to supervise any contract with a third party to provide for the removal and disposal of such vehicles; and to otherwise cause the implementation of and compliance with the provisions of this article. 
                  (b)  Whenever any derelict motor vehicle is required to be removed from any private real property, with regard to those activities requiring entry onto such property, the designated city employee shall be a peace officer as defined by state law or this Code. 
                  (Ord. of 3-16-1992, § III) 
                  Sec. 82-74. - Procedures. 
                  (a)  When any city employee designated by the city manager in accordance with this article shall ascertain that a motor vehicle and/or a part thereof is a derelict motor vehicle, or may become a derelict motor vehicle by remaining unattended for a period of ten days on public property and 30 days on private real property, provided that on the private real property, the vehicle is not enclosed in any fence, wall or other structure, and which totally obstructs it from public view, he shall prepare a notice to require such vehicle's removal and shall proceed to designate such vehicle as a derelict motor vehicle by affixing a copy of such notice to the vehicle, or part thereof, in a conspicuous place. The notice shall include the following information to the extent that it is available at the time of preparing such notice: 
                  (1)  The vehicle serial number or manufacturer's identification number; 
                  (2)  The vehicle license number; 
                  (3)  The vehicle make, year and model; 
                  (4)  The location of the vehicle; 
                  (5)  The date of execution and placing of such notice on the vehicle; and 
                  (6)  Such other information as may be required by the city manager. 
                  The notice shall also contain the following statement: 
                  "This vehicle has been left unattended on a public street, road or highway, or other public or private property in the City of Pooler. Unless removed by the owner within ten days on public property and 30 days on private property of the date of this notice, this vehicle will be removed at the direction of the city pursuant to the Derelict Motor Vehicle Ordinance of the City of Pooler and thereafter may be reclaimed only pursuant to such ordinance." 
                  The notice set forth in this subsection shall be supplemented by an additional notice imprinted on a water-resistant material, printed with indelible ink, of a size not less than three inches by five inches, to adhere in wind and rain, to be affixed to a window of the vehicle separate from the notice required in this subsection, which shall contain the following language: 
                  "This vehicle is subject to removal pursuant to the Derelict Motor Vehicle Ordinance of the City of Pooler within ten days on public property and 30 days on private property. If the official notice to remove is not elsewhere on this vehicle, please notify the city manager." 
                  The time for removal of such vehicle commences when the notice is affixed to the derelict motor vehicle. The applicable time period is determined by the status of the property on which the vehicle is located when the notice is affixed. A presumption exists that the vehicle remained on the property where the notice was affixed during the notice period if it is present there on the date the notice period expires. If the vehicle is moved to property contiguous to where it was initially noticed and the property is of a different status to which another time period applies, the interval between the date of the initial notice shall be counted toward the time period applicable to the alternate property status on which the vehicle is located. 
                  (b)  If at the expiration of the applicable period as provided in subsection (a) of this section after the posting of the notice, the derelict motor vehicle has not been removed from the public street, road or highway, or other public or private real property upon which it has remained for such period of time, any city employee designated by the city manager shall cause such vehicle to be removed for disposal. Upon the removal of any derelict motor vehicle, it shall be placed in an impounding area for a period of not less than 30 days, which shall be referred to as the "holding period" for the derelict motor vehicle. While being retained within the impounding area for the holding period, no person shall willfully remove any part from such vehicle, nor cause any damage thereto. 
                  (c)  At any time prior to the expiration of the holding period as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, the owner of the derelict motor vehicle, upon showing satisfactory evidence of ownership, may claim and take possession of the vehicle by making payment of such towing and storage charges as may have been incurred at the time in such amounts and in accordance with any requirements of the city manager and/or any contract executed by the city pursuant to this section. 
                  (d)  Subsequent to the removal of any derelict motor vehicle and the placing of such vehicle in an impounding area, the owner of the vehicle shall be notified of its removal, impounding and right of reclamation as provided in subsection (c) of this section, provided that the name and address of the owner of the vehicle may be determined with reasonable diligence. Notice to the party entitled to receive notices may be given by placing a copy of such notice in the United States mail addressed to the party entitled to receive such notice, with adequate postage thereon, and shall be sent by certified mail to the addressee only, with a return receipt, within five calendar days after ascertaining the owner of such vehicle. If the notice is unclaimed or returned, no further mail notice shall be required. Any certified mail which is refused shall be deemed to have been delivered. If the notice is unclaimed or returned, the following provisions pertaining to a published notice shall be performed, but the name of the owner shall be specified in the notice rather than reference to an unknown owner, and the owner shall be stated to have an unknown address. Whenever the name of more than one owner is determined, each owner shall be entitled to notice pursuant to this subsection. Whenever it is impossible to determine the name or address of any party entitled to receive notice, notice shall be given to the party as an unknown owner or as an owner at an unknown address by publishing such notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the city once a week for two consecutive weeks during the holding period. The notice shall contain information, to the extent it is available at the time of effecting such notice, specifying the: 
                  (1)  Vehicle serial number or manufacturer's identification number; 
                  (2)  Vehicle license number; 
                  (3)  Vehicle make, year and model; 
                  (4)  Location of the vehicle at the time of its removal; 
                  (5)  Location of the impounding area where the vehicle is being stored; 
                  (6)  Name and address of the party who is believed to be the present or last owner from such information as has been ascertained, or if none, then the owner will be stated to be unknown; 
                  (7)  Name and address of the party having custody over the impounding area; 
                  (8)  Date or expiration of the holding period for the vehicle; and 
                  (9)  Right of the owner to reclaim such vehicle. 
                  (e)  Subsequent to the expiration of the holding period, the derelict motor vehicle may be sold, destroyed, dismantled or otherwise disposed of at public or private sale by the city employee designated by the city manager to so act, or a third party with whom the city has contracted to so act, provided that the vehicle has not been claimed by its owner. 
                  (f)  The city manager shall cause records to be made and maintained which reasonably specify the identity of each derelict motor vehicle; its owner; its location prior to removal; its date of removal; the party removing and impounding such vehicle; the date and manner of the vehicle's disposal; procedures to notify the owner and a copy of any notices given pursuant to this section; and such additional items as may by be required by the city manager. Such records shall be preserved for not less than two years from the date of impounding of any derelict motor vehicle and shall be made available for examination by any owner of such vehicle which has been removed pursuant to this section. 
                  (g)  Any funds received by the city from the disposal of any derelict motor vehicle shall be paid to the general fund of the city. 
                  (h)  If a derelict motor vehicle is removed from public property at the request of a law enforcement officer, or if the vehicle is stored if the owner of the vehicle is unknown, the party having possession or control of the vehicle shall seek the identity of and address of the last known registered owner of such vehicle within 72 hours of removal thereof. 
                  (i)  If the derelict motor vehicle is removed from private property at the request of the property owner, or such vehicle is stored if the owner of the vehicle is unknown, the city police department shall be notified, in writing, of the location of the vehicle, the manufacturer's vehicle identification number (VIN), license number, model, year and make of the vehicle, within 72 hours of the removal of the vehicle, and shall seek from the city police department the identity and address of the last known registered owner of the vehicle, and any information indicating that the vehicle is a stolen vehicle. 
                  (j)  If any derelict motor vehicle removed under subsections (h) and (i) of this section is determined to be a stolen vehicle, the city police department shall notify the state crime information center and the owner of such vehicle, if known, of the location of the vehicle, within 72 hours after receiving notice that the vehicle is a stolen vehicle. 
                  (k)  If a derelict motor vehicle is not a stolen vehicle, being repaired by a repair facility or being stored by an insurance company for purposes of repair under a policy, the party having possession and control of the vehicle shall, within seven calendar days of the day the vehicle was removed, notify the owner, if known, of the location of the vehicle and the fees applicable to the removal and storage of the vehicle pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.

                  (a)  Any party with whom the city may contract to perform services pursuant to this article shall not be deemed to be an agent or employee of the city. Any act as authorized by this article shall be considered to be an act in the name of such party as an independent contractor. 
                  (b)  Any party with whom the city has contracted to perform services pursuant to this article shall comply with all the terms and conditions of this article as may be required to be performed while in the custody and possession of a derelict motor vehicle by such party. Upon the failure of such party to comply with the terms and conditions of this article, such party shall not be entitled to any storage fees.

                  Sec. 86-127. - User charge system. 
                  (a)  Generally. 
                  (1)  Established. All persons discharging wastewater into the city public sewer shall be charged a sewer service charge which shall recover the operation and maintenance (OandM) costs of the wastewater treatment facilities and sewer system, the local share of the capital costs of the treatment facility and the costs of other capital improvements of the sewage facilities. 
                  (2)  Basis of user charges. The required annual revenue from sewer charges shall include the following: 
                  a.  Billing costs. 
                  b.  Operation and maintenance costs. 
                  c.  Debt service. 
                  1.  The sewer user charge for residential users shall be based on water used in each billing month. 
                  2.  Industrial users shall be charged on the basis of water used monthly or sewage metered monthly throughout the year. For high strength wastes, a surcharge will be applied as established in subsection (a)(2)c.1.ii. of this section: 
                  i.  Billing charge. A billing charge divided equally among the billing periods will be assessed. 
                  ii.  Operation and maintenance. The required annual revenue for operation and maintenance will be obtained from user charges and industrial surcharges. Anticipated income from industrial surcharges will be deducted from the required operation and maintenance revenue and the remainder of the required revenue will be collected from users at the calculated operation and maintenance user charge rate as follows: 
                  User charge rate for operation and maintenance = OM — S / Q 

                   
                  There is no minimum charge for the operation and maintenance user charge. 
                  iii.  Debt service. The required annual revenue for debt service will be obtained from service charges as set in a rate ordinance. 
                  (b)  Industrial wastewater surcharges. 
                  (1)  Established. All industrial contributors whose wastewater discharges exceed 200 mg/l BOD and/or 200 mg/l suspended solids shall be assessed a surcharge in addition to the user charge. The charge shall be based on the proportionally higher BOD and suspended solids concentration the industry contributes to the wastewater treatment facility in excess of 200 mg/l BOD and total suspended solids (TSS). 
                  (2)  Basis of surcharge. The annual operation and maintenance costs for each year will be allocated as follows: 

                   
                  The expected average daily load at the plant for the subsequent year will be determined based on previous experience. 
                  (3)  Rate of surcharge. The surcharge rate is determined as follows: 

                   
                  (4)  Surcharge calculation. The surcharge shall be calculated as follows: 
                  Surcharge = Q × 8.33 [(BODi ;minus; 200) × BODR + (TSSi ;minus; 200) × TSSR] 

                   
                  (5)  Surcharge rate amendment. The surcharge rate will be analyzed annually at the same time as user charges are being reviewed and if adjustment of the rates is justified, new rates will be set by aldermanic board action. 
                  (6)  Monitoring. Monitoring of industrial wastewater will be performed by the city at the control manhole, as required by this Code. Monitoring will primarily include measurement of flow and analysis of a composite sample for five-day BOD, and for total suspended solids of industrial discharges with concentrations of nonsanitary/domestic flows. 
                  a.  When discharge of unusual concentrations of other pollutants, such as phosphorus and nitrogen compounds, or toxic pollutants is possible, the city will periodically have additional analyses performed to determine the concentrations of those pollutants which it is possible for the industry to discharge. 
                  b.  Flow will be metered either as the water used by the industry or the wastewater discharged by the industry. Wastewater discharge will be metered only when the industry has provided an effluent flow meter including recorder and totalizer. 
                  c.  The frequency of analysis for biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids will be based on daily discharge and will be as follows: 

                   
                  1.  Adoption. A rate ordinance based on the user charge system as set forth in this section shall be adopted to recover costs for administration, operation and maintenance, debt service and miscellaneous expenses of the sewage system. 
                  2.  Amendments. The rate ordinance shall be reviewed annually and amended, as necessary, to generate adequate revenue to offset all expenses of the sewage system. 
                  3.  Notification. All users shall be notified at least annually of the rates in effect for sewer service, including a breakdown of the portion of the rate which is attributable to operation and maintenance costs. Such notice shall be transmitted to the user with a monthly bill.

                  (g)  Removal and disposal of grease. It shall be the responsibility of the generator to ascertain when the container's contents has reached its capacity so that it is necessary to remove and dispose of the grease. No generator shall place grease in a container which has achieved its stated capacity for storage. It shall be unlawful to permit a spillage or overflow of grease either from a container, or in its movement or manipulation, or in the removal of the contents by a collector, such violation being by the party who is performing an activity regarding either the placement of grease in the container for storage or its collection. The generator and the collector shall possess chemicals or other substances and devices to remove or otherwise dissipate any substance which escapes the container during storage or collection, and the failure to possess such items and to remove or dissipate such substance shall be an additional violation of this section. It is a violation of this section for a container to exceed its capacity so as to result in an overflow or spillage. It is unlawful for a container to be in such a condition that it leaks or is not secured or placed so that it may tilt, turn over, or otherwise cause the contents to escape. 
                  (h)  Treatment and cleaning of container. Whenever the contents are removed from the container, it shall be cleaned or treated so that residue from the grease removed shall not remain and accumulate in the container.

All such vehicles shall be constructed, maintained and operated in such a manner that containers transported or grease which is transferred from a container to a tank or other holding device is maintained and operated so that there will be no spillage or leakage caused during the transport operation. 
                  (j)  Insurance. Every collector shall maintain in force public liability insurance covering its operations, activities and vehicles applicable to all operations and activities performed which are subject to this section with minimum limits of coverage of $500,000.00 per occurrence for personal injury and $100,000.00 per occurrence for property damage. Evidence of such coverage shall accompany any initial or renewal application for a business license as required under the revenue ordinance of the city. 
                  (k)  Contractual relationships. In the event that any contractual relationship exists between a generator and collector which creates or transfers a liability for incidents and activities which may be subject to this section, such a provision shall not relieve a party who violates this section from any penalties and liabilities hereunder, it being expressly declared that any transfer of a responsibility or liability between a party shall be between them. 
                  (l)  Inspections. The city may, without notice, regularly inspect the premises of generators to verify compliance with this section. Such inspectors shall keep accurate records of inspections and make available inspection records to the public upon written request. 
                  (m)  Violations. Any person or entity that violates the provisions of this section of this article may be punished up to the maximum extent allowed under this Code.

                  ARTICLE III. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Section 1. - Nonconforming uses. 
                  (A)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of a zoning ordinance is to have orderly use of property. Nonconforming uses that existed legally prior to the adoption or change of a zoning ordinance create land uses that do not conform to the zoning ordinance. It is the purpose of this nonconforming use provision to allow legally existing nonconforming uses to be retained with certain limitations to protect adjacent property owners and the public from inconsistencies created by nonconforming uses. It is the intent that over time all nonconforming uses will be eliminated. Any request for a continuance of a nonconforming use or any change in an existing nonconforming use needs the approval of the building official and the zoning administrator. An expansion of a nonconforming use would also need the approval of the city council. Any decision of the building official and the zoning administrator may be appealed to the aldermanic board. 
                  (B)  Continuance of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use of a building, structure or land that was legal prior to enactment of an amendment or adoption of the zoning ordinances shall be allowed to legally continue even though such use does not conform with the provisions of the chapter, subject to the following: 
                  (1)  The nonconforming use cannot be expanded to occupy a greater area of land or building area; 
                  (2)  A nonconforming use cannot be changed to another nonconforming use; 
                  (3)  A nonconforming use, which is changed to a conforming use, shall not be permitted to revert to the original nonconforming use without a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission and approval from the city council; 
                  (4)  The nonconforming use of the building, structure or land cannot be intensified or escalated, for example, by increasing the number of deliveries, employees or customers coming to the nonconforming use, or by an increase in noise, dust, fumes, or other pollutants emanating from the nonconforming use; or 
                  (5)  A nonconforming use cannot be reinstated after it has been abandoned. It shall be prima facie evidence of abandonment for the owner and/or operator of the nonconforming use to discontinue the nonconforming use for six months, or fail to obtain a new or renew an existing business license as required under the City of Pooler Code of Ordinances. 
                  (C)  Continuance of nonconforming structure or building. A building or structure that is nonconforming or that contains a nonconforming use at the time of enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or at the time of enactment of an amendment to this chapter may be retained, except that it shall not be: 
                  (1)  Enlarged, altered or rebuilt, except for repairs necessary to maintain the structure or building in a safe and sanitary condition; or 
                  (2)  Rebuilt, altered or repaired after damage or deterioration exceeding 75 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, except in conformity with this chapter. 
                  (D)  Restoration to a safe condition. Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the restoration of any building or structure to a safe or sanitary condition when required by the proper authorities. 
                  (E)  Errors and violations. The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans and/or specifications shall not be deemed or construed to be approval for any violation of any provision in this ordinance. No permit presuming to give the authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this ordinance shall be valid except insofar as the work or such which it authorizes is lawful. 
                  (F)  Use of residentially zoned property for access. Residentially zoned districts shall not be used for access to uses in a nonresidential zoned district unless permitted in said residential district. 
                  (Ord. of 3-17-2003) 
                  Section 2. - Access to public street required. 
                  No building shall be constructed or erected upon a lot, or parcel of land, which does not abut upon a public street, publicly approved street, or permanent easement of access to a public street. Such easement shall serve no more than two lots and must have a minimum width of 25 feet unless an easement of lesser width was of record prior to the adoption of this ordinance. 
                  Section 3. - Preexisting substandard lots. 
                  The purpose of this article is to grant relief to preexisting substandard lots that would create undue hardship to an individual case and allow the issuance of the building permits upon the said substandard lots. In order to qualify for relief under this article, the applicant must demonstrate the following: 
                  (A)  Failure to grant a building permit on this substandard lot would create a real, undue hardship; 
                  (B)  Demonstrate that at the time of the adoption of the zoning ordinance enacted on March 4, 1996, or at any date subsequent to its adoption, including the time which application for relief under this article has been requested, the applicant did not own any contiguous property to said lot; 
                  (C)  The owner intends to construct only one single-family residence or a use of lesser impact. 
                  When applicant has demonstrated all of the above requirements of this article to the satisfaction of the city council for the City of Pooler, then the building official shall issue a building permit for said substandard lot. 
                  Section 4. - Buildings to be moved. 
                  Any building or structure which has been wholly or partially erected on any premises located within the city shall not be moved to any other premises in the city until a permit for such removal is secured from the building and zoning department. Any such building or structure shall conform to all the provisions of this ordinance in the same manner as a new building or structure. No building or structure shall be moved into the city from outside the city until such compliance has been shown and such permit has been secured.

                  (Ord. of 7-7-1997, § II; Ord. of 10-19-1998, § I; Ord. of 11-1-2004, § 2) 
                  Section 2. - Districts shown on maps. 
                  The boundaries of the various districts are shown on a zoning map of Pooler, which is located in the office of the city hall. The zoning map of the incorporated area is hereby made a part of this ordinance; and all notations, references, and other information shown thereon shall be as much a part of this ordinance as if all the matter and information set forth by said maps were fully described herein. 
                  Section 3. - Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. 
                  When uncertainty exists with respect to the location of boundaries of any zoning district as shown on the zoning map of the City of Pooler, the following rules shall apply: 
                  (A)  Unless otherwise specifically indicated, where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as approximately following the center line of a street, highway, railroad right-of-way line, stream bed or river bed or such center lines extended, then such center lines shall be construed to be such district boundaries. 
                  (B)  Where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as approximately following the corporate limits line of the city, then such corporate limits line shall be construed to be such district boundaries. 
                  (C)  Where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as being set back from a street, road, highway, railroad, stream or river and parallel thereto, then such district boundaries, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the center line of such street, road, highway, railroad, stream or river and as being parallel thereto. 
                  (D)  Where a district boundary divides a lot, the requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall be extended to the balance of the lot; provided, however, that such extension shall not include any part of such lot which lies more than 50 feet beyond the district boundary; and provided further, that this provision shall not apply to a through lot. In the case of a through lot, the restriction of the district applying to adjoining lots which front on the same street as the lot frontage in question shall apply. 
                  Section 4. - Conditional uses. 
                  Within each zoning district a particular list of land uses are set aside from the uses permitted by right. These conditional uses may only be permitted after the applicant has submitted the proper application information, the planning commission has reviewed the application at a public hearing and the aldermanic board has approved the use based on the application information. 
                  (A)  Restrictions on conditional uses. No conditional use may be: 
                  (1)  Extended to occupy a greater area of the land unless authorized to [do] so by the governing body. 
                  (2)  Extended to occupy a greater area of building or structure unless such additional area of building or structure already exists as part of the building or structure, and is clearly designed to house the same kind of use as the conditional use occupying the building unless authorized to do so by the aldermanic board. 
                  Section 5. - R-1A, one-family residential dwelling district. 
                  (A)  Purpose of district. This district is defined as an area designated for the development of one-family dwellings, with limited nonresidential uses. This district is composed of certain lands and structures in the city limits having a medium density, predominantly one-family character and additional open areas where it is desirable and likely that similar development will occur. Certain non-residential uses such as schools, parks, and public utilities intended primarily to provide service to the adjacent neighborhood are permitted after applications are submitted to the Pooler Planning Commission for review and approved by the aldermanic board. 
                  (B)  Permitted uses. Within the R-1A class, no building, structure or land shall be used except for one-family site-built dwellings and accessory uses and buildings. Only one primary residence will be allowed per lot. 
                  (C)  Conditional uses. The conditional uses enumerated below may be permitted upon applications being submitted to the Pooler Planning Commission for review and approved by the aldermanic board. Site development plan is required to accompany the application: 
                  (1)  Churches and other places of worship with attendant educational and recreational buildings, 
                  (2)  Hospitals, nursing homes, and charitable institutions when located on a tract of land of not less than three acres, 
                  (3)  Privately owned day nurseries, preschools, and kindergartens, provided a minimum of 100 square feet of outdoor play area is provided for each child and that all such areas are enclosed on all sides with at least a four-foot high fence and 30 square feet inside floor area is provided for each child. A daycare which is inside of an existing residence shall be limited to a maximum of six children, 
                  (4)  Clubs, including golf and country clubs, publicly and privately owned recreational facilities, athletic fields or stadiums and swimming pools, provided a comprehensive site development plan for the entire area shall be submitted to the Pooler Planning Commission for review and approved by the aldermanic board with specific plans for each of the facilities to be developed, 
                  (5)  Public utility structures and land including radio and television towers and transmitters provided that they are enclosed with an eight-foot high chain link fence, but not to include studios; and, 
                  (6)  Home occupations. 
                  Section 6. - R-1B, one-family residential dwelling district. 
                  Purpose of district. This district is defined as an area designated for the development of one-family dwellings, with limited nonresidential uses. The R-1B district permits the same uses as in the R-1A district. The only variation is in the lot dimension and yard setback requirements. R-1B restricts development to a much lower density. 
                  Section 7. - R-1C, one-family residential dwelling district. 
                  This district is defined as an area designated for the development of one-family dwellings, with limited nonresidential uses. The R-1C district permits the same uses as in the R-1A district. The only variation is in the lot dimension and yard setback requirements. R-1C restricts development to the lowest density of the R-1 districts. 
                  Section 8. - R-2A, two-family residential dwelling district. 
                  (A)  Purpose of district. This district is defined as an area designated for the development of up to two-family dwellings, with compatible nonresidential uses. This district is composed of certain limited areas in the city limits where it is desirable to recognize a more extensive form of residential use than in the R-1 districts. Provisions are made for the placement of duplex units, either singly or in groups, on a lot or tract of land. This is not intended to be a high density area. It is the intent of this classification to allow for this type of development within R-1 districts as spot zoning. 
                  (B)  Permitted uses. Within the R-2A district, unless otherwise permitted by this ordinance, no building, structure or land shall be used except for the following: 
                  (1)  One-family site-built dwellings, 
                  (2)  Two-family site built dwellings,

                  (6)  Two-family modular dwellings. 
                  (C)  Conditional uses. Shall be the same as the R-1A district. 
                  Section 9. - R-2B, two-family residential dwelling district. 
                  Purpose of district. This district is defined as an area designated for the development of up to two-family dwellings, with compatible nonresidential uses. The R-2B district permits the same uses as in the R-2A district. The only variation is in the lot dimension and yard setback requirements. R-2B restricts development to the lowest density of the R-2 districts. 
                  Section 10. - R-2C, two-family residential dwelling district. 
                  Purpose of district. This district is defined as an area designated for the development of up to two-family dwellings, with compatible nonresidential uses. The R-2C district permits the same uses as in the R-2A district. The only variation is in the lot dimension and yard setback requirements. R-2C restricts development to a much lower density. 
                  Section 11. - R-3A, multifamily residential dwelling district. 
                  (A)  Purpose of district. This district is defined as an area designed for the development of multifamily dwellings, with compatible nonresidential uses. Certain nonresidential uses such as a clubhouse, a sales office, recreational center and facilities intended primarily to provide service to the residents are permitted after applications are submitted and approved in the site development plan. Due to the high concentration of persons and vehicles, this district shall be situated where they are well served by public and commercial services and have convenient access to thoroughfares. Density in the R-3A zoning district is based on net acre of residential land. 
                  (B)  Permitted uses. Within the R-3A district, unless otherwise permitted by this ordinance, no building, structure or land shall be used except for the following: 
                  (1)  One-family dwellings that meet R-1A dimensional requirements. 
                  (2)  Two-family dwellings that meet R-2A dimensional requirements. 
                  (3)  Multifamily site-built or modular dwellings that meet the R-3A dimensional requirements. 
                  (4)  One-family modular dwellings that meet R-1A dimensional requirements. 
                  (5)  Two-family modular dwellings that meet R-2A dimensional requirements.

Requests pertaining to the establishment of a PUD district shall be considered as an amendment to the zoning ordinance and shall be administered and processed accordingly. Requests must include a master plan submittal which may vary from other existing ordinances and regulations concerning use, setbacks, lot size, density, bulk and other requirements. Applicants seeking PUD zoning shall meet with appropriate staff/board/commission members for a preliminary review prior to making an application for rezoning. A general outline of the proposal along with supporting concept plans shall be submitted. The appropriate staff/board/commission members will furnish the applicant with comments prior to the final master plan submittal. The final master plan will then be submitted to the planning commission for review, public hearing and comment, and then forwarded to aldermanic board for approval. All portions of the master plan shall comply with the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  6.  Preliminary PUD zoning. Prior to obtaining a PUD zoning amendment, the applicant may file for preliminary PUD zoning which would establish the total allowable net density, total residential units and total acreage allowances for all proposed land use zones such as residential, commercial and industrial.

                  (Ord. of 7-7-1997, § II; Ord. of 10-19-1998, § I) 
                  Section 27. - Main Street overlay district. 
                  (A)  Declaration of purpose, scope and intent. The City of Pooler has identified U.S. Highway 80 as a major transportation corridor through the city, which was once the only paved east west link between Savannah and Macon and historically has been Pooler's "Main Street". It has also generated development along its corridor going back to the 1920's and that trend continues to the present, more in the form of redevelopment and infill development. 
                  Therefore, the purpose of the Main Street overlay district is to provide the City of Pooler a means to unify, coordinate and control the execution of development in a practical and aesthetic manner that enhances and protects the future prosperity of the district without undue burden on owners or developers. The purpose and intent of the Main Street overlay district design standards shall be: 
                  (1)  To implement the comprehensive plan; 
                  (2)  To attract new businesses, residents, patrons and visitors; 
                  (3)  To promote main street style / urbanism design standards by offering development incentives; 
                  (4)  To provide an attractive gateway to the community. 
                  (B)  Main Street overlay district defined. The Main Street overlay district begins at 1-95 and includes both sides of Highway 80 extending westward to the city limits of Pooler. The entire corridor is commercially zoned excluding a small section, which is zoned I-1, Light Industrial. Also, included are the lots that front Collins Street, also known as the abandoned Central of Georgia railroad right-of-way. The official boundaries of the Main Street overlay district are shown on the official zoning map of the City of Pooler. 
                  (C)  Allowed uses. The allowed uses within the overlay district shall be those as allowed by the underlying zoning district of the parcel. However, due to the desire to make this a unique mixed use area within the city, mixed use buildings with upper story residential uses (second floor or greater) are allowed within the limits of the overlay district. 
                  (D)  Definitions. 
                  Building frontage on front street. Building frontage percentage on a front street shall mean the minimum percentage of a front yard street that has a building façade, wall or a public space within an area from five to 15 feet from the front street. The standard shall only apply to front streets and shall not apply to side, corner or rear yards. All buildings shall have at least one required front yard setback. For buildings that front on multiple streets, the owner shall determine which streets shall be identified as a front street. 
                  Mixed use. Any development or building that includes residential and nonresidential principal uses. 
                  Upper story residential. One or more residential dwelling units located above a floor which contains one or more commercial uses. 
                  (E)  Design standards. Along with the standard requirements for site plan, the following design standards shall be shown on all site plans and shall be considered in evaluating proposed developments within the Main Street overlay district: 
                  (1)  Setbacks . It is recognized that the typical setback standards of the base zoning districts do not allow for or encourage the style of pedestrian oriented development desired within this district. Therefore, the minimum setback from any public right of way within the overlay district shall be five feet. It is desired to have buildings and publicly accessible spaces constructed to front on the public right-of-ways, with parking to rear of the property, either to the back or sides of the building. There shall be a minimum 5-foot side yard setback unless the building is proposed as a common wall development, then the minimum setback shall be zero feet. The minimum rear yard setback shall be ten feet. 
                  Corner cutouts, notches or increased setbacks may be necessary to meet sight distance requirements at driveway and street intersections. Such sight distance requirements shall be based on the current GDOT and AASHTO calculations based on the road / street speed and traffic volume. 
                  (2)  Parking . Parking standards shall be in accordance with the City of Pooler Appendix A-Zoning, Article III, Section (5)(D). However; alternatives to the established parking requirements may be granted to developments which provide a study and have a mixture of uses whose peak parking requirements do not coincide in time and thereby may share parking spaces, or if there is nearby public parking that can serve the proposed development. Similarly, unique site designs that exhibit creative ways to save trees, increase open space or otherwise minimize the negative impact of parking areas, etc. may be considered in approving a deviation from the stand parking criteria. This deviation may be approved based on the consideration and merits of the parking study and does not have to meet the required considerations of Section 9 for a variance. 
                  A by-right 25 percent reduction to the required parking shall be granted if the development is designed in such a manner that places a building and / or publicly accessible; greenspace, plazas or other hardscape areas (not including parking) between five feet and 15 feet from the front property line for a minimum of 60 percent of the front street frontage. 
                  (3)  Building heights. Buildings heights shall have a by-right height allowance of the base zoning district. However; up to 60 feet in height can be requested if the project is mixed used in nature and places a building and / or publicly accessible; greenspace, plaza or other hardscape areas (not including parking) between five and 15 feet from the front property line for a minimum of 60 percent of the front street frontage. In all situations, the requirements of Section 6 of the zoning code for buildings over 35 feet must be addressed. 
                  (4)  Buffers / Screening. 
                  a.  Where parking lots are not screened by building placement / massing from being visible on public rights-of-way or to adjacent properties, which are a non-residential zoning or uses, one of the following must be provided.

                  - A solid hedge of evergreen plant material. Initial installation shall be a minimum 24 inch height and shall be a species that can be maintained at 36 inches high and spaced appropriately to grow to a solid hedge within two years. This hedge must be perpetually maintained to ensure no gaps develop due to poor plant health or death. 
                  b.  For areas where the adjacent zoning is a residential zone, the following standards will apply. 
                  - Where properties are developed in the desired style of the overlay district, with parking to the rear or sides of the property and the building frontage on a front street of 60 percent or greater, one of the following must be provided. 
                  º A 6-foot height wall made of pierced or solid brick (or other construction material complimentary to the architecture) or

Initial installation shall be a minimum six feet in height and shall be a species that can be maintained at a minimum of six feet high and spaced appropriately to grow to a solid hedge within two years. This hedge must be perpetually maintained to ensure no gaps develop due to poor plant health or death. 
                  - Where properties are developed in a conventional nature, with parking to the front and the building to the rear, the following must be provided. 
                  º A 20-foot-wide buffer, composed of plant material and a 6-foot height wall made of pierced or solid brick (or other construction material complimentary to the architecture). The wall shall be placed in the middle of the buffer to allow maintenance of the landscape by the property owner to both sides of the wall. 
                  c.  All exterior non-residential trash receptacles and multifamily residential with common trash receptacles shall be screened from public view on three sides and on the fourth side by a gate that screens the receptacles from view.

                  (5)  Trees/Open space. It is recognized that the urban style of development envisioned for this overlay district may not be compatible with the city's typical minimum requirement of 20 percent open space and 15 trees per acre on any site. Therefore, the minimum open space shall be reduced to ten percent and a payment in lieu [of] tree planting based on Section 42-199(c) of the City of Pooler Tree Protection Ordinance shall be allowed for any development that places a building and / or publicly accessible; greenspace, plaza or other hardscape areas (not including parking) between five and 15 feet from the front property line for a minimum of 60 percent of the front street frontage. Should the site be developed in a conventional manner, with parking between the building and front street and / or the building setback over 15 feet from the front street, the standard 20 percent required minimum shall be required.

                  It shall be unlawful for any person to commence excavation for, or construction of any building or structure, or moving of any existing building or structure without first obtaining a permit from the building official. No permit shall be issued for the construction or alteration of any building or structure until proper approval has been granted and fees have been submitted in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 

                  Section 1. - Permits required for construction. 
                  The following is a list of permits needed for construction of a building or structure or the movement of a building or structure that may be needed for any type of land development in the City of Pooler, Georgia. 
                  (A)  Building permit. A building permit issued by the administrative officer [building official] is required in advance of the initiation of construction, erection, moving or alteration of any building or structure. All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by a plat or plan in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the size of the building to be erected, the location of the building on the lot, the number of dwelling units the design is to accommodate, and such other information as may be essential for determining whether the provisions of this ordinance are being observed. A record of such application and plats or plans shall be kept by the administrative officer [building official]. A building permit is also required for swimming pools, fences, and lawn irrigation systems. 
                  (B)  Relocation permit. A relocation permit is required anytime a manufactured home, mobile home, trailer, out building, house or structure is moved from any location to any lot or parcel within the city limits of Pooler. Electrical, mechanical and plumbing permits are included within this permit. Buildings used for the purpose of storage only with no need for electricity or plumbing are exempt from this requirement. 
                  (C)  Sign permit. Prior to the erection of a sign for either on premises or off premises advertising, the building official must first issue a permit in accordance with the sign regulations set forth in the City of Pooler Sign Ordinance. Permits are required for both temporary signs as well as permanent signs. 
                  (D)  Demolition permit. Prior to destruction of a building, structure, or sign, a demolition permit is needed. Such permit may be attained from the City of Pooler Building and Zoning Department. 
                  (E)  Electrical permit. An electrical permit is needed before installing any electrical wiring or fixtures. This permit is not needed if a re-location permit or building permit has already been issued on the structure. 
                  (F)  Plumbing permit. A plumbing permit is needed whenever a plumber installs a new plumbing system in an existing structure. This permit is not needed if a re-location permit or building permit has already been issued on the structure. 
                  (G)  Mechanical permit. A mechanical permit is needed before a licensed installer may install any mechanical device such as a heating and/or cooling system for air or water. This permit is not needed if a re-location permit or building permit has already been issued on the structure. 
                  (H)  Subdivision of land. Whenever a lot, parcel, or tract of land is divided into two or more parts, the owner must submit a preliminary subdivision plat to the building official. The preliminary plat shall be reviewed at a public meeting held by the planning commission and then by the aldermanic board at a public hearing to follow. Once the preliminary plat is approved by aldermanic board, required infrastructure improvements may be permitted on the property. After the required infrastructure improvements are completed and inspected by the building inspector [official], a final plat may be submitted to the building official. The final plat shall be reviewed at a public meeting held by the planning commission and then by the aldermanic board at a public hearing to follow. Once the final plat is approved by the aldermanic board, all parcels created by the subdivision may be recorded in the Office of the Superior Court of Chatham County and subsequently become real estate. Subdivisions of three lots or less may be considered a minor subdivision where the preliminary and final plat procedure are combined into one. However, subdivisions of four lots and more or any division where infrastructure improvements are required will be considered as major subdivisions and must endure the complete process. 
                  Section 2. - Permits or actions required by this ordinance. 
                  The following are permits that may be required depending on the construction and particular land use district for which it will take place: 
                  (A)  Conditional use permits. There are specific land uses permitted in certain zoning districts only after a review by the planning commission, a public hearing has been held by the aldermanic board, and the aldermanic board has determined that the use is appropriate based on certain criteria. These uses are listed throughout article IV and the criteria is listed in section 7 of this article. 
                  (B)  Site plan approval. All building or land development activities other than residential one and two family structures, regardless of the zoning district, must present an approved site plan of the building or land development activity to the building official prior to the issuance of any building and/or land development permits. 
                  (C)  Zoning variance. Where strict enforcement of this ordinance may present an unnecessary hardship upon a lot or parcel of land, the owner may apply for a zoning variance. Such action requires a public hearing by the planning commission and approval by the aldermanic board at a scheduled meeting. 
                  (D)  Amendment to the zoning map. An amendment to the zoning map is considered to be an amendment to the zoning ordinance. Such action requires a public hearing by the planning commission and approval by the aldermanic board at a scheduled meeting. 
                  (E)  Amendment to the text of this ordinance. An amendment to the text of the zoning ordinance follows the same process as an amendment to the zoning map. However, a text amendment requires different materials to be included with the application.

                  (2)  Construction in wetlands. In conjunction with Georgia DNR, the United States Army Corps of Engineers maintains the authority to delineate the location of wetlands and is responsible for permitting any land disturbing activity in them under Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  (3)  Individual well systems. If an individual well system is required for any land development, a well permit is required from the building official. 
                  (4)  Individual sewer systems. If a lot or parcel is not served by city sewer utilities a permit is required from the Chatham County Board of Health. 
                  (5)  Entrances on state and federal highways (curb cuts). If the development of a lot, tract, or parcel requires an entrance onto a State or Federal Highway, a permit is required by the Georgia Department of Transportation. 
                  (6)  Shallow wells for irrigation only. If a property owner decides to use a shallow well for the irrigation of his or her landscape, a well drilling permit must be obtained from the City of Pooler Building Official and the pump installation and design must meet the plumbing codes set forth by Southern Building Code Congress International and the laws of the state.

                  f.  All known previous applications for a map amendment affecting the same premises; and, 
                  g.  A scaled map or plat, which shall be attached to each of the application forms required. Said map or plat shall show the property referred to in the application and all adjoining lots or parcels of land which are also under the same ownership. 
                  (Ord. of 6-1-1998(2); Ord. of 6-21-2010, § I) 
                  Section 5. - Public notice. 
                  After a completed application has been filed, the next step in the approval process for a zoning action required by this ordinance is to set a date for a public hearing on the matter and render proper notice to the public. Proper public hearing notice procedures are as follows: 
                  (A)  Legal notice. Notice of public hearings before the planning commission and the aldermanic board as required by this section shall be published within a newspaper of general circulation within the city in which are carried the legal advertisements of the city and shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing and shall also include the location of property that is the subject of the zoning action, the present zoning district of said property, and the proposed zoning district or proposed zoning action of said property. Such notice for the official public hearing before the aldermanic board shall be published at least 15 days; but, not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing. 
                  (B)  Signs posted. Where a zoning action of property is initiated, a designated official of the city shall post a sign at least 15 days prior to the aldermanic board public hearing, in a conspicuous place on the property for which an application for a proposed zoning action has been submitted. The sign or signs will contain information as to the current zoning district, the proposed zoning district or zoning action, and the date, time and location of the public hearings before the planning commission and the aldermanic board. 
                  (C)  Notification to adjacent property owners. At least seven days prior, but not more than 45 days before the date of the public hearing a notice setting forth the date, time and place for such public hearing shall be sent by mail to the applicant, the planning and zoning commission, and all owners of property located adjacent to or across a public right-of-way from the property being proposed for rezoning. The notice shall also include the location of the property, its present zoning classification and the proposed zoning classification. The names and addresses of owners of such properties to be notified shall be provided by the applicant as set forth herein; provided, however, where a map amendment is initiated by the planning commission such names and addresses of owners of property located adjacent to or across a public right-of-way from property being proposed for rezoning shall be provided by the building official. Failure of the building official to send notices or failure of the property owner to receive notification shall not affect the validity of any zoning action. This procedure exists as a supplement to the legally required notification procedures. 
                  Section 6. - Public hearing requirements. 
                  Whenever a zoning action takes place, a hearing must be held before the public. When an applicant requires more than one zoning action or subdivision procedure for a development project, a separate public hearing must be held for each procedure or action. In the City of Pooler there are two public hearings held for each zoning action or subdivision procedure. One before the planning commission and the other before the aldermanic board. The public hearing before the aldermanic board is by record the official public hearing. The purpose of each public hearing is to discuss information pertinent to the particular action or procedure. During the hearing the following rules and actions shall be followed: 
                  (A)  General rules of conduct. Whenever a public hearing is required by this ordinance or by state law prior to approving a zoning action, such public hearing, whether conducted by the aldermanic board or the planning commission, shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures: 
                  (1)  The public hearing shall be called to order by the presiding officer. 
                  (2)  The presiding officer shall explain the procedures to be followed in the conduct of the public hearing. 
                  (3)  If the subject of the hearing is initiated by an applicant other than the aldermanic board, the petitioner requesting such zoning decision, or the applicant's agent, shall be recognized first and shall be permitted to present and explain the request for the zoning decision. Thereafter, all individuals who so desire shall be permitted to speak in favor of the zoning decision. 
                  (4)  If the request is initiated by the aldermanic board, all members of the aldermanic board shall be allowed to speak as they are recognized by the mayor or presiding officer, regardless of whether such aldermanic board member speaks in favor of or in opposition to the proposed zoning decision. Thereafter, all individuals who so desire shall be permitted to speak in favor of the zoning decision. 
                  (5)  After all individuals have had an opportunity to speak in accordance with section 6(a)(3) above, those individuals present at the public hearing who wish to speak in opposition to the requested zoning decision shall have an opportunity to speak. 
                  (6)  When any person wishes to speak at a public hearing, he shall raise his hand and, after being recognized by the presiding officer, shall stand and give his name, address, and make any comment appropriate to the proposed zoning decision. If within two years immediately preceding the filing of the applicant's application for a zoning action, the speaker has made campaign contributions aggregating to more than $250.00 to any member of the aldermanic board or any member of the city planning commission, it shall be the duty of the speaker to disclose the following information five days prior to the official public hearing: 
                  a.  The name of the local government official to whom the campaign contribution or gift was made; 
                  b.  The dollar amount of each campaign contribution made by the applicant to the local government official during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the application for the map amendment and the date of each contribution; and 
                  c.  An enumeration and description of each gift having a value of $250.00 or more made by the applicant to the local government official during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the application for the zoning action. 
                  d.  In the event that no such gift or contribution was made, the applicant shall affirmatively so state. Campaign disclosure forms are available at the Pooler City Hall during normal hours of operation. Also, campaign disclosure forms shall be made available to the public at the planning commission public hearing for use at the official public hearing before the city council. 
                  (7)  No time limit shall be imposed upon any person speaking at a public hearing, but all speakers are urged to make their comments brief and avoid repeating other comments. 
                  (8)  The applicant shall have an opportunity, after all comments in opposition have been made, to make summary remarks concerning the proposed zoning decision. 
                  (9)  Thereafter, the presiding officer shall announce that the public hearing for the requested zoning decision is closed, and the city council or the planning commission, as the case may be, shall immediately and openly discuss the proposed zoning decision and vote on action which they are authorized to take. 
                  (B)  Actions specific to the planning commission during a public hearing. In all zoning actions in the City of Pooler, the planning commission is a recommending body and all final decisions must be made by the city council. However, the planning commission has an important role in the public hearing process. This role is as follows: 
                  (1)  All proposed zoning actions shall be reviewed by the planning commission in a public hearing in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 6(A). 
                  (2)  The planning commission shall review and consider a recommendation to the city council with respect to the application for a zoning action. The planning commission may decide to make no recommendation or it may make any of the following recommendations with respect to an application for a zoning action: approval, denial, deferral, withdrawal without prejudice, reduction of the land area for which the application is made, change of the zoning district requested, or imposition of zoning conditions; and 
                  (3)  The planning commission shall submit its recommendation on a zoning action application to the city council prior to the scheduled public hearing in which the city council will consider the application for a zoning decision. If the planning commission fails to submit a recommendation prior to the public hearing, the planning commission's recommendation shall be deemed one of approval. 
                  (C)  Actions specific to the city council during a public hearing. 
                  (1)  Before taking action on a proposed amendment and after receipt of the planning commission recommendations and reports thereon, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment at their next scheduled meeting. 
                  (2)  So that the purpose of this zoning ordinance will be served and so that health, public safety and general welfare will be secured, the city council may in its legislative discretion: 
                  a.  Approve or deny the proposed zoning action as submitted, 
                  b.  Reduce the land area for which the application is made, 
                  c.  Change the zoning district to one other than that requested; or, 
                  d.  Add or delete zoning conditions as the city council deems appropriate. If conditions are imposed on a zoning, the minutes should reflect explicitly the conditions and a written copy attached to the minutes as part of the record. Once conditional zoning is applied, the zoning conditions can be changed. A change in a zoning condition would be subject to the Zoning Procedures Law, O.C.G.A. 36-66-1, requiring notice and a public hearing. 
                  (3)  An action to defer a decision on the proposed amendment shall include a specific meeting date to which the proposed amendment is deferred. The city council may also approve a withdrawal of an application, and if so stipulated by the city council in its decision to approve withdrawal, the 12-month limitation on re-filing of the application for the same property shall not apply. 
                  (D)  Public hearings records standards. The city clerk or an agent of the city clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of all zoning public hearings. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but only if requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party, who must arrange at his expense for a certified court reporter to record and transcribe the hearing and furnish the original of the transcript to the city council for its records. The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular zoning action's file. 
                  (Ord. of 7-21-2003(2), § I) 
                  Section 7. - Standards for conditional use permission. 
                  Land uses listed in article IV of this ordinance that are permitted as conditional uses must follow an administrative procedure prior to the issuance of any land development permit. 
                  (A)  Review criteria. The planning commission shall hear and make recommendation upon such uses in a district that are permitted as conditional uses. The application to establish such use shall be approved by the city council on a finding that: 
                  (1)  The proposed use will not be contrary to the purpose of this ordinance, 
                  (2)  The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood or adversely affect the health and safety of residents and workers, 
                  (3)  The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such facility, vehicular movement acquainted with the use, noise or fumes generated by or as a result of the use, or type of physical activity associated with the land use, 
                  (4)  The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses of adjacent properties, 
                  (5)  The proposed use will be placed on a lot which is of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use, 
                  (6)  The parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted will be met; and, 
                  (7)  The action will not adversely impact adjacent or nearby properties in terms of property values, by rendering such properties less suitable and therefore less marketable for the type of development to which they are committed or restricted in order to promote the public welfare and protect the established development pattern. 
                  (B)  Additional mitigation requirements. The planning commission may suggest and the city council may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards (e.g., increased setbacks, buffer strips, screening, etc.): 
                  (1)  As may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community; and 
                  (2)  To protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood. 
                  (C)  Adherence to requirements. Provided that wherever the city council shall find in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations, noncompliance of any term, condition, or restrictions upon which such permit was granted, the city council shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing. 
                  (D)  Permit longevity. Conditional use permission granted by the city council shall be valid for a period of 12 months from date of approval. Such approval is based on information provided in the application. Building permits may only be granted for plans consistent with the approved application. Any deviation from the information submitted will require separate approval by city council. 
                  Section 8. - Site plan approval. 
                  The site plan approval process is intended to provide the general public, planning commission, city council with information pertinent to how a new development will affect the surrounding area and the city as a whole. There is no evaluation process or set of regulations other than what is required to be shown on the plan and listed upon the application. Site plan approval does not constitute approval of any other zoning action or permit. 
                  (A)  Process. Upon submittal of the site plan, the building official will review the site plan for noticeable discrepancies and determine if there is a need to apply for other zoning actions. The site plan is then forwarded to the City of Pooler engineer. Once the engineer has submitted comments to the building official, the site plan shall be placed on the agenda of the next planning commission meeting. Until the applicant addresses all of the engineer's comments and the site plan is satisfactory, the city council will not review the plan. However, once the first public meeting is held before the planning commission, site plan approval may commence at any scheduled meeting of the city council. 
                  (B)  Zoning actions. Once a site plan has met the application and process requirements the necessary zoning action process may begin. 
                  (C)  Site plan approvals pursuant to this article are valid for a period of one year from the date of approval, after which the approval expires. If a person or entity submits an expired site plan to the building official for issuance of a building and/or land development permit, the site plan must be resubmitted for new approval, adhering to all applicable rules and provisions for new site plans, including fees assessed in accordance with section 3 of this article. In the absence of a validly issued building or land development permit, any expired site plans retained by the city may be disposed of at the discretion of the planning and zoning department. 
                  (Ord. of 12-19-2011, § II) 
                  Section 9. - Variances. 
                  (A)  Standards. After an application has been submitted to the building official, reviewed by the planning commission, and a public hearing has been held by the city council, the city council may grant a variance from the strict application of the provisions in this ordinance only if at least two of the following findings are made: 
                  (1)  That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions beyond that of surrounding properties, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of the lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions, peculiar to the particular property, 
                  (2)  That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, the property cannot be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinance, without undue hardship to the property, 
                  (3)  That granting the variance will not result in authorization of a use not otherwise permitted in the district in which the property is located or cause substantial detriment to the public good. 
                  (B)  Height variances. For residential height variances the petitioner shall be required to add two feet to each side yard set back for each one foot above 35 feet in height and have safe guards consisting of sprinkler systems, smoke detectors and any other fire protection equipment deemed necessary at the time by aldermanic board. Where a rear yard abuts a side yard of the adjacent lot, the petitioner shall be required to add two feet to the rear setback for each foot above the 35 feet height, and have safe guards consisting of sprinkler systems, smoke detectors, and any other fire protection deemed necessary at the time by aldermanic board. 
                  (C)  Permit longevity. After a variance has been granted by the aldermanic board it shall be valid for a period of 12 months from date of approval. Such approval is based on information provided in the application. Building permits may only be granted for plans consistent with the approved application. Any deviation from the information submitted will require separate approval by aldermanic board. 
                  Section 10. - Standards for zoning ordinance or map amendment. 
                  In order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the City of Pooler against the unrestricted use of property, the following standards and any other factors relevant to balancing the above stated public interest will be considered, when deemed appropriate, by the aldermanic board in making any zoning decision: 
                  (A)  Is this request a logical extension of a zoning boundary which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area? 
                  (B)  Is this spot zoning and generally unrelated to either existing zoning or the pattern of development of the area? 
                  (C)  Could traffic created by the proposed use or other uses permissible under the zoning sought traverse established single-family neighborhoods on minor streets, leading to congestion, noise and traffic hazards? 
                  (D)  Will this request place irreversible limitations on the area as it is or on future plans for it? 
                  (E)  Is there an imminent need for the rezoning and is the property likely to be used for the use requested? 
                  (F)  Will the proposed use substantially conflict with existing density patterns in the zone or neighborhood? 
                  (G)  Would the proposed use precipitate similar requests which would generate or accelerate adverse land use changes in the zone or neighborhood? 
                  (H)  Will the action adversely impact adjacent or nearby properties in terms of: 
                  (1)  Environmental quality or livability resulting from the introduction of uses or activities which would create traffic, noise, odor or visual hazards or the reduction of light and air that is incompatible with the established development pattern. 
                  (2)  Property values, by rendering such properties less suitable and therefore less marketable for the type of development to which they are committed or restricted in order to promote the public welfare and protect the established development pattern. 
                  (3)  Will the action create development opportunities of such increased intensity that stormwater runoff from the site cannot be controlled within previous limits, with [which] results in adverse impacts upon existing down-stream drainage problems or potential problems? 
                  (I)  Will the action result in public service requirements such as provision of utilities or safety services which, because of the location or scale of the development, cannot be provided on an economic basis and therefore would create an actual burden to the public? 
                  Section 11. - (Reserved) 
                  Section 12. - Enforcement. 
                  (A)  Zoning enforcement officer. The aldermanic board shall provide for the enforcement of this chapter by appointing a building official, who shall, jointly with other inspections personnel, have the right to withhold building permits. The building official shall not have the authority to grant approval to any building permit that does not meet the requirements of the zoning ordinance. 
                  (B)  Violations. Any building or structure that is erected, altered, converted, or maintained in violation of this Code shall be subject to a minimum penalty of $500.00. Continuance of a violation shall be considered a separate and distinct offense for every day the violation is continued. Furthermore, such structure that is in violation of this Code is not eligible to petition for a variance or other zoning action and will be subject to fines until the structure is brought within compliance of this Code. 
                  (C)  Enforcement of violations. When the building official finds that any provision of this ordinance is being violated, the building official or agent thereof shall execute the following procedures: 
                  (1)  Thirty days prior to legal action by the city, send a written notice to the person responsible for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. Additional notices may be sent at the building official's discretion. 
                  (2)  Fifteen days prior to legal action by the city, send a final notice by certified mail stating the action the building official intends to pursue if the violation is not corrected and shall advise that the building official's decision may be appealed to the aldermanic board at the next scheduled meeting. 
                  (3)  Upon approval by aldermanic board the building official shall file the complaint with the Clerk of the Municipal Court of Pooler. 
                  a.  Upon receipt of the complaint, the clerk of the municipal court shall cause the complaint and a hearing notice to be issued and served upon the owner of and any parties in interest in the property or sign which is involved in or is the subject of the complaint. Such hearing shall be held before the judge of the municipal court not less than ten days nor more than 30 days after service of the complaint. 
                  b.  Complaints or orders issued by the municipal court pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance shall, in all cases, be served upon each person in possession of said property, each owner, and each party in interest; and the return of service signed by the public officer or his agent or an affidavit of service executed by any citizen of this state, other than the resident initiating the complaint; and the return of such public officer or agent thereof or the affidavit of such citizen that such party or parties were served either personally or by leaving a copy of the complaint or order at the residence shall be conclusive as to such service. 
                  c.  If any of the owners and parties in interest reside out of the city, service shall be perfected by causing a copy of such complaint or orders to be served upon such party or parties by the sheriff or any lawful deputy of the county of the residence of such party or parties or such service may be made by any citizen; and the return of services signed by the public officer or his agent or an affidavit of service executed by any citizen of this state, other than the resident initiating the complaint; and the return of such sheriff or lawful deputy or the affidavit of such citizen that such party or parties were served either personally or by leaving a copy of the complaint or order at the residence shall be conclusive as to such service. 
                  d.  Nonresidents of this state shall be served by posting a copy of such complaint or orders in a conspicuous place on premises affected by the complaint or orders. Where the address of such nonresidents is known, a copy of such complaint or orders shall be mailed to them by registered or certified mail. 
                  e.  In the event either the owner or any party in interest is a minor or an insane person or person laboring under disabilities, the guardian or other personal representative of such person shall be served and if such guardian or personal representative resides outside the county or municipality or is a nonresident he shall be served as provided for in subsection (C)(3)d. of this section. If such guardian or personal representative or in the event such minor or insane person lives outside the city or is a nonresident, service by leaving a copy at the place of his residence which shall be sufficient evidence as to the service of such person or persons; in the case of other person who live outside of the city or are nonresidents, service shall be perfected by serving the judge of the probate court of the county wherein such property is located who shall stand in the place of and protect the rights of such minor or insane person or appoint a guardian ad litem for such person. 
                  f.  In the event the whereabouts of any owner or party in interest is unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the building official in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the building official shall make an affidavit to that effect. Then the service of such complaint or order upon such persons shall be made in the same manner as provided in subsection (C)(3)d. of this section or service may be perfected upon any person, firm, or corporation holding itself out as an agent for the property involved. 
                  g.  A copy of such complaint or orders shall also be filed in the proper office or offices of the Pooler Municipal Court and such filing of the complaint or orders shall have the same force and effect that appropriate lis pendens notice may contain a statement to the effect that a lien may arise against the described property and that an itemized statement of such lien is maintained on a lien docket maintained by the city clerk. 
                  (D)  Complaints regarding violations. Whenever the zoning enforcement officer receives a written, signed complaint alleging a violation of this ordinance, he or she shall investigate the complaint, take whatever action is warranted, and inform the complainant in writing what actions have been or will be taken. 
                  (E)  Persons liable for violations. The owner, tenant, or occupant of any building or land or part thereof and any architect, engineer, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who participates in, assists, directs, creates, or maintains any situation that is contrary to the requirements of this ordinance may be held responsible for the violation and suffer the penalties and be subject to the remedies herein provided.

                  Sec. 706. - Maintenance bond. 
                  (a)  Upon completion of construction and prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for any project which a performance bond or other acceptable security has been posted in accordance with section 703.03 of this article, the developer shall provide, on a form acceptable by the city, a maintenance bond, escrow account, certified check, or irrevocable letter of credit from a bank which has a business office within the State of Georgia, in the amount of 50 percent of the total cost of all infrastructure improvements and maintenance and landscape requirements. 
                  (b)  If a bond is offered, it shall be executed by a surety or guaranty company qualified to transact business in the State of Georgia and acceptable to the city. In no event shall the depositor of the irrevocable letter of credit or bond have any significant interest in the bank upon which such irrevocable letter of credit has been authorized or in the surety or guaranty company issuing the bond. Significant interest of the depositor means acting as an officer or director or owning more than one (percent of the stock of such bank, surety or guaranty company.) 
                  (c)  Measured from the initial date the required security is approved by the city, if no faults or failures develop within 12 months, the city may reduce the required security amount by 50 percent. At the end of the second 12 months, the developer shall request an inspection, and if no faults or failures have developed, the city may release the bond or escrow upon approval by the aldermanic board. 
                  (d)  The bond or escrow shall remain in force until released by the aldermanic board and shall not automatically expire at the end of 12 months. Bond and escrow forms are available from the office of the city clerk.

                  Sec. 800. - Exemptions. 
                  The following types of subdivision shall not be defined as subdivisions and shall be exempted from the requirements of this ordinance, pursuant to the provisions of the act authorizing the adoption of this ordinance: 
                  (a)  The subdivision of a tract of land into two or more lots, each having an area of five acres or more, and in which no new street, and no new or expanded utilities is required. (The dividing of a tract, into two or more lots of five acres or more each, which requires new access roads or utilities shall be defined as a subdivision under the terms of this ordinance and a preliminary plan will be required.)

                  Sec. 801. - Final plat approval only. 
                  In the case of a subdivision which shall have lots fronting only on existing, open, and public street and which does not require a new street, or requires no extension of water and sewer, the developer of such subdivision shall only be required to submit a final plat. The aldermanic board shall approve such final plat if they find that the subdivision described thereon complies with all of the applicable requirements of this ordinance. 
                  Sec. 802. - Variance. 
                  When a peculiar shape or the topography of a tract of land, or other unusual condition, makes it impractical for a developer to comply with the literal interpretations of the design requirements of this ordinance, the planning commission may recommend that such requirements be waived; provided, however, that in so doing, the intents and purposes of this ordinance are not violated, and recommend variance is approved by the aldermanic board of the City of Pooler.

                  Unless a subdivision hereafter established shall be designed, developed, and recorded in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, then: 
                  (a)  The city shall not accept the dedication of any street within such subdivision, nor shall the city improve, maintain, grade, pave, or light any street within such subdivision unless such street or streets shall have received the status of public streets prior to the adoption of this ordinance. 
                  (b)  The city shall not assume any responsibility for drainage problems within such subdivision unless city owned and maintained drainage structures already exist in such subdivisions.
