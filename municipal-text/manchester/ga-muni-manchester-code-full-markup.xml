         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Manchester, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1990 Code, as supplemented through October 22, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1990 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This republication was under the direct supervision of Brenda Blair, Editor, MaLinda Allen, Proofreader, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

               PART I - THE CHARTER AND RELATED LAWS[1] 
                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Part I of this Code is a compilation of the City Charter and related state laws of local application involving the city adopted by the Georgia General Assembly or adopted under home rule by the city along with state constitutional amendments of local application to the city. No state laws of general application are reprinted here but references to those laws are occasionally included in appropriate places. Local acts clearly superseded by general law are excluded in this compilation. 
                  The material included in this division has been arranged by basic acts or according to subject matter. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted and, where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Any material in brackets has been added to clarify the meaning of the text. At the end of each section appears a reference to the basic act and amendatory acts, if any. The editor has added section numbers and catchlines to facilitate the use of this compilation and indexing; however, formal citations should be to the original act, and not to this compilation.

Any number of streets or any part or parts thereof to be so improved may be included in one resolution, but any protest or objection shall be made as to each street separately; provided, however, that if the owners of a majority of the lineal feet of frontage of the land liable to assessment for any such improvement shall petition the governing body for such improvement, citing this act and designating by a general description the improvement to be undertaken and the street or streets or part thereof to be improved it shall thereupon be the duty of said governing body to proceed as hereinafter provided to cause the said improvements to be made in accordance with the prayers of said petition and their own best judgment; and in such cases the resolution hereinbefore mentioned shall not be required.

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

The commission may approve the certificate of appropriateness as proposed, approve the certificate of appropriateness with any modifications it deems necessary, or reject it. The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material changes in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the following criteria for each of the following acts: 
                  (1)  Reconstruction, alteration, new construction or renovation. The commission shall issue certificates of appropriateness for the above proposed actions if those actions conform in design, scale, building material, setback and site features, and to the secretary of interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings. 
                  (2)  Relocation. A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the relocation of a building, structure or object shall be guided by: 
                  a.  The historic character and aesthetic interest the building, structure or object contributes to its present setting. 
                  b.  Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be. 
                  c.  Whether the building, structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity. 
                  d.  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, structure, site or object. 
                  (3)  Demolition. A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, sites, trees judged to be 50 years old or older, or objects shall be guided by:

                  b.  The importance of the building, structure, site, tree or object to the ambiance of a district. 
                  c.  The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, site, tree or object because of its design, texture, material, detail or unique location. 
                  d.  Whether the building, structure, site, tree or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood or the city. 
                  e.  Whether there are definite plans for use of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be. 
                  f.  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, site, tree or object from collapse. 
                  g.  Whether the building, structure, site, tree or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value. 
                  (g)  Undue hardship. When, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this division would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions, or to interpret the meaning of the provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this division. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making. 
                  (h)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the filing by the owner or occupant of historic property, or of a building, structure, site or object located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by the United States Postal Service to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. 
                  (2)  Failure of the commission to act within 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (i)  Necessary action to be taken by commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  If the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits; and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (j)  Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. If work is performed not in accordance with such certificate, the commission shall issue a cease and desist order; and all work shall cease. 
                  (2)  The city council or the commission shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of this division or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. 
                  (k)  Certificate of appropriateness void if construction not commenced.

                  (m)  Acquisition of property.

                  (n)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the city council.

Such conditions as broken windows, doors and openings which allow the elements and vermin to enter, and the deterioration of a building's structural system shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. 
                  (2)  If the commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property will have 30 days in which to do this. 
                  (3)  If the condition is not remedied in 30 days, the owner shall be punished as provided in section 2-237; and, at the direction of the city council, the commission may perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the commission. 
                  (c)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this division shall be construed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city or county building and zoning codes, nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of this property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.

                  (a)  All purchasing, leasing or contracting for equipment, materials and supplies shall be governed by this division. Contracts for services, where feasible, should be competitively bid upon written specifications approved by the city manager; however, it is recognized that the ability to render certain services, particularly those of learned professionals, are often unique to an individual contractor and are incapable of competitive bidding. All contracts shall be reviewed by the city attorney as to legal form, approved by the mayor and council, and spread upon the minutes of the council meeting at which approval was had. 
                  (b)  Repairs and general maintenance, where feasible, should be competitively bid; however, certain equipment, systems and facilities can only be repaired or serviced through authorized service centers or by specially trained personnel, which do not engage in bidding. The public interest is best served by maintaining such equipment, systems and facilities in accordance with manufacturer's requirements and warranties. For this reason, such services may be obtained without first obtaining bids as generally required by this division.

In his discretion, the city manager, upon recommendation of the purchasing agent, may delegate to the department head the procurement of items having a cost of less than $100.00 without quotes. Where feasible, however, whenever like purchases are required by more than one department, the purchasing agent shall consolidate purchase orders to receive full advantage of quantity discounts. All other procurement of equipment, material and supplies for which budgetary approval has been given, having an estimated cost of $2,500.00 or more, and not procurable through federal, state or intergovernmental contracts (including but not limited to the department of administrative services, Georgia Correctional Industries Administration, and Georgia Municipal Association Equipment Leasing Programs) shall be competitively bid upon written specifications drawn by the department head in consultation with the purchasing agent, as reviewed and approved by the city manager. The manner of advertisement or bid solicitation, the period bid solicitations remain open, and procedures governing bid openings shall be determined by the city manager in writing prior to issuance of bid solicitations.

                  In determining the lowest and best reliable bid, a preference of up to five percent or $250.00, whichever is least, may be given to manufacturers, distributors, materialmen and suppliers having local business addresses within the 31816 zip code area. Otherwise, as far as may be reasonable and practicable without sacrificing price or quality, preference may be given to state suppliers over out-of-state suppliers.

               <p>
                  Sec. 16-1. - Title. 
                  The rules and regulations contained herein shall be known as the City of Manchester Media Productions Ordinance. 
                  (Ord. of 5-11-2015) 
                  Sec. 16-2. - Purpose. 
                  It is the public policy of the State of Georgia to market the state as a location for media productions, recognizing the economic impact this industry provides, as well as the tourism it generates for local jurisdictions, such as. City of Manchester is further fortunate to have a diverse number of unique locations to attract movies and television productions to the city. 
                  Despite the many positive benefits a media production may offer, certain inconveniences may result if the production company and city cannot work in concert to assure minimum standards are met and to assure a thoroughly planned production schedule is followed. These concerns are best addressed through a regulatory permit. 
                  (Ord. of 5-11-2015) 
                  Sec. 16-3. - Definitions.

Any filming involving automobile crashes or chases, gunfire, pyrotechnics, explosives, the use of aircraft, stunts, and similar activities. High-impact activities are activities that always take place at a location that is outside the boundaries of a permanent filming location. 
                  Low-impact activities means those activities having an intended duration of no more than 14 consecutive days, with little or no disruption to normal and customary use of the site of use and adjacent and nearby properties and uses. Low-impact activities are activities that always take place at a location that is outside the boundaries of a permanent filming location. 
                  Permanent filming activities means those activities that are on-going and occur at a fixed location intended primarily for such purposes and usually using facilities and structures that are permanent or intended to remain in place for an indefinite period of time. These facilities and structures may include, but are not limited to, components of film production such as studios, sound stages, production laboratories, equipment storage areas, fabrication shops, office, accompanying food services, and permanent working sets. The notice requirement found in section 16-8(4) shall apply. 
                  (Ord. of 5-11-2015)

Any media production on public property, intended to be closed to participation by the public, or restricting access to public property or facilities normally accessible by the public, shall require a permit. For purposes of this chapter, media production activity shall include areas designated for parking of trucks and equipment on public or private property, base camps used during the production activity, and food service areas.

                  (2)  To inspect all existing buildings and structures as required by such codes and to permit and inspect new construction and the renovation, alteration, modification and repairs to existing structures to assure compliance with applicable state minimum code standards; 
                  (3)  With consent of the city manager, under the budgetary and personnel regulations of the city, to employ inspectors and other personnel necessary for the proper enforcement of such codes and to provide for the authority, functions and duties of such inspectors;

When such contract has been entered and spread upon the official minutes of the council, the acts of such officer shall be deemed the acts of the city as if fully performed directly by the city, its officers and employees.

                  Pursuant to the authority contained in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-26(d), self-inspection of water and sewer projects by master plumbers or utility contractors shall be applicable within the city.

                  Sec. 18-34. - Limitation of liability for code enforcement; no special duty created. 
                  It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, life, safety and general welfare of properties and occupiers of buildings and structures within the city in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. Approval of a permit and inspection of a property shall in no manner guarantee or warrant to the owner or occupants that the property has been constructed, maintained or operated in conformance with applicable codes, laws and regulations. The city reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship. To the extent any federal or state law, regulation or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent; and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professionals and contractors, to satisfy such legal requirements.

                  Sec. 18-51. - Permits. 
                  (a)  Required. No person shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, convert or demolish any building or structure within the city, or cause such action to be done, without first obtaining a permit for such building or structure from the building official. Separate permits are required for grading, electrical, plumbing, mechanical and low-voltage. 
                  (b)  Fees. Permit fees shall be an amount prescribed in the schedule of fees and charges. 
                  (c)  Personal residence exception. Any city resident may take overall responsibility as prime contractor for the new construction of a home on their own property, or modifications and alterations of and additions to an existing home, without a business license as otherwise required by this section; however, in such instances, all subcontractors to the property owner shall be required to have a current city business license. 
                  (d)  Term. Permits shall generally be good for six months from date of issuance; but if the work is not completed within the initial permit term, but has been diligently pursued, the permit may be extended, without additional charge, for successive three-month terms, so long as the work continues to be diligently prosecuted. 
                  (e)  Revocation for suspension or abandonment. If work authorized by a permit is suspended or abandoned, after the initial term, for a period of 30 days, without good cause shown to the building official, the permit may be revoked upon written notification to the permit holder. Revocations of permits for abandonment are not appealable to the board of construction appeals. 
                  (f)  State licensing required. No person shall engage in electrical, plumbing, mechanical or low-voltage contracting on any work within the city unless licensed by the state. Where a state license is required, every applicant for a permit shall furnish proof, at time of application, that he or the person contracted to do the work holds a valid state license in good standing. Failure to meet this requirement may be grounds for revocation of the permit.

                  Prior to issuance of any permit, in addition to the information requested on the permit application, the building official may require tests, plans and specifications, plats and other written documentation from engineers, architects, surveyors and other professionals to ensure that full compliance with all permitting requirements of the state minimum standard codes and applicable laws have been met. No permits shall issue on any project where the structure to be built or improved is a special hazard structure or the use to be conducted is a special hazard use, without first obtaining the approval of building plans by the state fire marshal's office. Where a project is subject to permitting under the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), no permit shall issue for any land disturbing activity unless approved plans are received from the district soil conservation office and all required stabilization facilities are in place, and ready for inspection. All buildings and structures intended for human occupancy shall have a safe source of drinking water and sanitary disposal; no permit shall issue for any building or structure which does not have access to public water and sewer unless plans for a well and/or septic tank have been approved by the county health department. All permits shall be conditioned upon the application and supporting data, which is deemed incorporated into and made a material part or term of the permission granted. No permit shall be issued until all requisite fees have been paid in full.

The building official may also revoke a permit upon determining that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving or demolition of the building or structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of or not in conformity with the provisions of state minimum standard codes provided the work was stopped in accordance with section 18-53 and the permittee has not met the conditions for resuming the work after a reasonable period for compliance has been granted.

                  Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of the state minimum standard codes, or whenever the building official has probable cause to believe that there exists in any building or structure or upon any premises within the city any condition or code violation which makes such building, structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the building official or his designee may enter such building, structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the building, structure or premises or to perform any duty imposed by this article; provided, if such building, structure or premises is occupied, he shall first present proper credentials and request entry from the building's owner or occupant. If such building, structure or premises is unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or person having charge or control of the building, structure or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the building official may apply to the judge of the municipal court of the city for an administrative search warrant.

Where such decisions cannot be personally served, service shall be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the party's last known address as shown on official government records. Any party aggrieved by a decision, order or ruling of the building official may appeal such decision to the board of construction appeals by filing a written notice of appeal, within 30 days, with the city clerk; however, in any case where the building official has issued an order for the repair, closing or vacating of a building or structure on grounds it is unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous so as to constitute a public nuisance, no appeal shall be taken; and the aggrieved party will be summoned to appear for hearing before the municipal court. A ruling by the board of construction appeals shall be deemed final.

                  (a)  In those limited cases where the state minimum standard codes allow a local variance based upon hardship, the board of construction appeals may, upon finding that strict enforcement of the state minimum standard codes would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of such codes and the public interest, grant a variance, subject to finding, in writing, all of the following: 
                  (1)  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure, or system involved and which are not applicable to others similarly situated; 
                  (2)  That the special condition and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant; 
                  (3)  That granting of a variance will not confer on the applicant any special privileges that are denied by the codes to other buildings, structures or service systems; 
                  (4)  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system; and 
                  (5)  That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of such codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  In granting a variance, the board of construction appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the codes, including a reasonable time limit in which the variance is required to be commenced or completed, or both. Each decision of the board shall recite the factual findings underlying its decision and the reasons for such decision. A copy of the board's written decision shall immediately be filed in its minutes of the hearing at which the variance was considered and a copy promptly served upon all affected parties. Decisions of the board shall be final, subject to all applicable remedies afforded by law or in equity.

                  Sec. 18-206. - Purpose. 
                  The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services. 
                  In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, the mayor and council, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations at O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 61, Urban Redevelopment, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread. 
                  In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

                  (6)  No property shall be designated as blighted unless the municipal court of Manchester enters an order that finds the property in question meets the criteria described in section 18-208(1), (2) or (3). This order constitutes official identification of real property as maintained in a blighted condition. 
                  (7)  If the municipal court finds that the property is blighted, it shall, in the same order, list what must be done to remove the blighted condition designation, and give the owner a deadline in which to finish the work.

                  (a)  An occupation tax is levied annually upon those businesses and practitioners of professions and occupations with one or more locations or offices within the corporate limits of the city and, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-7, upon out-of-state persons with no location or office in the state, based on a combination of criteria being:

                  (2)  The number of employees of the business or practitioner at that location or office in accordance with the following schedule: 

                   
                  (b)  For purposes of calculating the tax due, the number of employees of the business or practitioner shall be computed on a full-time position equivalent basis. An employee who works 40 hours or more weekly shall be considered a full-time employee, and the average weekly hours of employees who work less than 40 hours weekly shall be added and such sum shall be divided by 40 to produce full-time equivalents. For taxpayers commencing business after July 1, the rate of tax shall be half the rate for the full calendar year. 
                  (c)  Persons with no physical location either in the city or the state but which perform services or sell products within the corporate limits of the city shall be subject to the administrative fee and occupation tax if such person has more than nominal business activity within the city, including: 
                  (1)  One or more employees who exert effort within the jurisdiction of the city for the purpose of soliciting business or serving customers or clients; or

                  (d)  On or before December 1 of each year the city clerk shall mail to each registered business or practitioner of a profession or occupation subject to the tax a business registration and return form for the following calendar year. Every person subject to the tax imposed by this article shall file a return, under oath, by April 1 in every year the tax is due stating the location and number of employees upon which the tax is calculated. It shall not constitute a defense to the payment of the tax levied under this article that a person failed to receive a tax return form from the city clerk.

A person who has locations or offices elsewhere in the state and who does not have a location or office within the city, but who is subject to occupation tax by virtue of more than nominal business activity within the city, shall be subject to occupation tax by the city, unless the person provides documentation to the city of current payment of an occupation tax to at least one other state local government. A person who has a location or office within this city and one or more locations or offices in other taxing jurisdictions within the state shall be taxed only on a flat tax, plus the number of employees within the city. 
                  (b)  Persons from out-of-state with no office or location in the state subject to an occupation tax under this article shall be required to pay an occupation tax to only one local government in the state. Such local government shall be the government of the municipal corporation or county in which the largest dollar volume of business is done or services are performed by the person.

                  Sec. 22-35. - Registration of businesses. 
                  (a)  Before conducting any business or practicing any profession or occupation within the corporate limits of the city, it shall be the duty of each person engaging in a business, trade, profession or occupation, to register with the city clerk on forms provided for that purpose. The registration by each person shall state the location or office address from which business is conducted, identify the dominant line of business, profession or occupation conducted, state the number of employees (based on full-time equivalents) and identify, by name, address and other pertinent information requested, the form of business organization and its ownership.

Registration forms shall be signed, under oath, and dated, by an owner of the business.

                  (c)  It is not the intent of the city to require registration as a means of regulating any business, trade, profession or occupation; but solely as a means for acquiring information on those businesses and professions operating within the city for purposes of determining liability for payment of the occupation tax. No fee shall be imposed for filing a registration statement or for ascertaining whether such business or practitioner has paid an occupation tax to another local government.

An application may appeal the decision of the city manager regarding such denial by filing a written request for a hearing with the mayor within ten days after applicant has given notice of such denial. The city manager's decision on the application shall be final unless an appeal is timely filed. An appeal shall not stay the city manager's decision on the issuance of a license.

An original license application shall be required to be filed for the proposed relocation, and the city manager shall conditionally grant the application, if granted, on the stipulation that the license will not actually be issued until the applicant discontinues operation at its existing location and surrenders the license for its existing location. Any such relocation must be completed within 180 days from the date that the license is conditionally granted or the conditional grant of the application will become void. Pending the removal of the sexually oriented business to its new location, both the old and new locations shall be deemed to be operating under a license for purpose of measurements to locations of other proposed sexually oriented business for which applications may be filed. 
                  (e)  In any instance in which the proposed sexually oriented business tract description submitted by an applicant pursuant to section 22-191(c)(6) of this chapter, above, for a license reflects a tract or parcel of land that has resulted from a subdivision of property for which compliance with the applicable subdivision requirements of this chapter was required, and the city manager determines that the property has not been lawfully subdivided in accordance with the proper subdivision requirements, then the city manager shall cause all measurements and determinations regarding the issuance of the license to be made on the basis of the parent tract from which the subdivision was made, rather than the subdivided tract.

                  (3)  Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the mayor finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the mayor shall execute and file with the city clerk a document marking the end of the state of emergency.

                  9.  To provide welfare benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes;

The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 38-84 (b), (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in section 38-84 (b), (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in C.15. and 16., in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 38-84 (b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 38-84(b), (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 8-13-2012, § IV) 
                  Sec. 38-85. - Application/permit process.

Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 38-35(c)(15), (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 38-35(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. the local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 38-34(b), (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to o.C.G.A. § 12-7-20.

                  DIVISION 2. - WETLANDS DISTRICT 

                  Sec. 38-104. - Findings of fact. 
                  The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study; and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
                  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lot or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piece meal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.

                  The purpose of this district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, flood plain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas. This article is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practical as determined through the permitting process.

                  Sec. 38-110. - Findings of fact. 
                  In order to provide for the health, safety, welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within City of Manchester, Georgia, and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter storm water runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, storm water runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated, expensive and rendering water resources unusable. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby drinking water supplies.

                  ARTICLE VI. - WATER SUPPLY PROTECTION ORDINANCE 

                  Sec. 38-130. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within City of Manchester and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter storm water runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, storm water runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the City of Manchester; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to the following watershed, which occurs within the jurisdiction of Talbot County and are herein identified as water supply watershed: Rush Creek Reservoir.

                  Sec. 38-155. - Legislative findings; policy of state and intent of chapter. 
                  It is found that soil erosion and sediment deposition onto lands and into waters within the watersheds of this state are occurring as a result of widespread failure to apply proper soil erosion and sedimentation control practices in land clearing, soil movement, and construction activities and that such erosion and sediment deposition result in pollution of state waters and damage to domestic, agricultural, recreational, fish and wildlife, and other resource uses. It is therefore declared to be the policy of this state and the intent of this chapter to strengthen and extend the present erosion and sedimentation control activities and programs of this state and to provide for the establishment and implementation of a state-wide comprehensive soil erosion and sedimentation control program to conserve and protect the land, water, air, and other resources of this state.

                  The board, by appropriate rules and regulations, shall adopt the procedures governing land disturbing activities which are conducted in those counties and municipalities which do not have in effect an ordinance conforming to this chapter. Such rules and regulations shall be developed by the division in consultation with the commission and shall contain provisions which meet those minimum requirements set forth in Code Section 12-7-6. 
                  (Ord. No. 2001-4, Exh. A, § 12-7-5) 
                  Sec. 38-159. - Requirement for best management practices, to include sound conservation and engineering practices as a minimum. 
                  (a)  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsection (b) of this Code section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year rainfall event. 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm-water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. 
                  (3)  Failure properly to design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act" for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (b)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sediment, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control In Georgia" published by the State Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading, and other development activities shall be conducted in such a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut and fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type, so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures must be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this chapter; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by the means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for control or treatment of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (a) of this Code section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subparagraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; provided, however that buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act" shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  On or before December 31, 2000, the board shall adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial by the director of requests for variances. After such date, no variance shall be granted by the director which is not consistent with the criteria contained in such rules; provided, however, that, should the board fail to adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the granting or denial of requests for variances by the director on or before December 31, 2000, the authority of the director to issue such variances shall be suspended until the board adopts such rules; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act" except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided, however that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board providing for notice to the division or local issuing authority of the location and extent of the piping and prescribed methodology for minimizing the impact of such piping and for measuring the volume of water discharged by the stream. Any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner must comply with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  On or before December 31, 2000, the board shall adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial by the director of requests for variances. After such date, no variance shall be granted by the director which is not consistent with the criteria contained in such rules; provided, however, that, should the board fail to adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial or requests for variances by the director on or before December 31, 2000, the authority of the director to issue such variances shall be suspended until the board adopts such rules; and 
                  (c)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (a) and (b) of this Code section. 
                  (d)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this Code section or the terms of the permit.

                  (a)  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted in this state, except those land disturbing activities provided for in Code section 38-171, without the property owner where the land disturbing activity will occur first securing the permit required by this Code section. 
                  (b)  In those counties and municipalities which are certified pursuant to subsection (a) of Code section 38-162: 
                  (1)  The application for such permit shall be made to and the permit shall be issued by the governing authority of the county wherein such land disturbing activities are to occur, in the event that such activities will occur outside the corporate limits of a municipality; and 
                  (2)  In those instances where such activities will occur within the corporate limits of any municipality, the application for such permit shall be made to and the permit shall be issued by the governing authority of the municipality in which such land disturbing activities are to occur. 
                  (c)  In those counties and municipalities which are not certified pursuant to subsection (a) of Code section 38-162, the application for such permit shall be made to and the permit shall be issued by the division. 
                  (d)  Except as provided in this subsection, no permit shall be issued pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this Code section unless the erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved by the appropriate district as is required by Code section 38-164. When the governing authority of a county or municipality lying within the boundaries of the district demonstrates capabilities to review and approve an erosion and sedimentation control plan and requests an agreement with the district to conduct such review and approval, the district, with the concurrence of the commission, shall enter into an agreement which allows the governing authority to conduct review and approval without referring the application and plan to the district, if such governing authority meets the conditions specified by the district as set forth in the agreement. A district may not enter into an agreement authorized in this Code section with the governing authority of any county or municipality which is not certified pursuant to subsection (a) of Code section 38-162. 
                  (e)  (1)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or this Code section within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (2)  The issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this Code section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. This subsection shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (f)  No permit may be issued pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this Code section unless the applicant provides a statement by the tax collector or tax commissioner of the county in which the property for which the permit is requested lies and by the official responsible for the collection of municipal taxes in the municipality within which such property lies, if applicable, certifying that all ad valorem taxes levied against the property and due and owing have been paid.

                  Person means any individual, partnership, firm, association, joint venture, public or private corporation, trust, estate, commission, board, public or private institution, utility, cooperative, State agency, municipality or other political subdivision or the State, any interstate body or any other legal entity. 
                  Project means the entire area of the proposed development site, regardless of the size of the area to be disturbed. 
                  Sediment means solid material, both organic and inorganic, that is in suspension, is being transported, or has been moved from its site of origin by, wind, water, ice, or gravity as a product of erosion. 
                  Sedimentation means the action or process of forming or depositing sediment. 
                  Soil and water conservation district approved plan means an erosion and sedimentation control plan approved in writing by the soil and water conservation district in which the proposed land disturbing activity will take place. 
                  Stabilization means the process of establishing an enduring soil cover of vegetation and/or mulch or other ground cover and/or installing temporary or permanent structures for the purpose of reducing to a minimum the erosion process and the resultant transport of sediment by wind, water, ice or gravity. 
                  State waters means any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells, and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural and artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the State which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation, except as may be defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(7).

                  (3)  Upon receipt of a complete application, the division shall submit a copy to the appropriate soil and water conservation district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. 
                  (4)  Where variances or determinations under the provisions of section 38-185 must be considered, the director may require additional copies of the complete application. 
                  (c)  Issuance or denial of a permit: 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the division of a complete application and plan, and after variances and bonding have been obtained where necessary. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the division unless the erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved by the appropriate district and the division affirmatively determines that the plan is in compliance with O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., as amended, and with these rules and regulations. 
                  (3)  A permit issued by the division may specify any conditions under which the land disturbing activity shall be undertaken. The issuance of a permit does not relieve the permittee of any obligation or responsibility of complying with the provisions of any other laws or rules and regulations of any federal, local or additional State authority. 
                  (4)  The division shall, upon denial of a permit, state in writing to the applicant its reasons for the denial, setting forth specifically wherein such application and plan are found to be deficient. 
                  (5)  The permit is effective until completion of the permitted land disturbing activity project. However, if the permitted land disturbing activity project does not commence within 12 months from the date of permit issuance, the permit will become null and void. 
                  (d)  Bonding: 
                  (1)  Provision for bonding: When reviewing any application for a land disturbing activity permit, the division shall consider the past record of the permit applicant in complying with previous land disturbing activity permits and these rules and regulations. If the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or these rules and regulations within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the division may require the applicant to post a bond up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with these rules and regulations or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the division may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (2)  Types of bonds which are acceptable: Any type or combination of the following bonding may be provided to fulfill the permittee's bonding obligation. The bonding shall be held until the affected lands or any portion thereof are satisfactorily stabilized. If the stabilization responsibility is successfully fulfilled, the permittee will have the bonding obligation terminated, and the bonding will be returned to the permittee with such notification. 
                  a.  Government securities. Government securities in the form of U.S. Treasury notes or bonds are acceptable. These securities must be properly assigned to the department of natural resources. All outstanding interest coupons shall remain attached to coupon bonds. If this type of security is unacceptable, then it shall be returned to the applicant through certified mail. 
                  b.  Surety bond. A surety bond must be executed by an approved surety company authorized to do business in Georgia. The approved surety bond form shall be provided by the division and shall be properly filled out and executed by both principal and surety. If the surety is unacceptable, then it shall be returned to the applicant through certified mail. 
                  c.  Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit. A letter of credit must be submitted on the issuing institution letterhead and signed by the appropriate official. An acceptable format for a "Letter of Credit" shall be provided to the applicant by the division. The issuing institution must be domiciled in the State of Georgia. If the letter of credit is unacceptable, it shall be returned to the issuing institution by certified mail and the applicant so notified. 
                  (3)  Acceptable bonding shall be provided to the environmental protection division prior to the land disturbing activity permit being issued. 
                  (e)  Suspension, revocation or modification of permit: The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the division, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon a finding that the holder or his successor in title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of these rules and regulations. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit.

                  Sec. 38-185. - Buffer variance procedures and criteria. 
                  (a)  Buffers on state waters are valuable in protecting and conserving land and water resources, therefore buffers should be protected. The buffer variance process will apply to all projects legally eligible for variances and to all state waters having vegetation wrested from the channel regardless of stream size. The only exception is a general variance for the piping of trout waters with an average annual flow of 25 gpm or less. 
                  (b)  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  (1)  Due to the unusual shape or topography of the property at the time of the adoption of this rule, there is no opportunity for any development under any design configuration unless a buffer variance is granted; or 
                  (2)  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the law would create an extreme hardship; or 
                  (3)  The project involves the construction or repair of a structure which, by its nature, must be located within the buffer. Such structures include dams, public water supply intake structures, waste water discharges, docks, boat launches, and stabilization of areas of public access to water; or 
                  (4)  The project is for the exclusive purpose of restoration and enhancement, the goal of which is to improve water quality and/or aquatic habitat quality; or 
                  (5)  Buffer intrusion is necessary to provide access to the property; or 
                  (6)  The intrusion is for gravity-flow sewer lines that cannot reasonably be placed outside the buffer, and stream crossings and vegetative disturbance are minimized; or 
                  (7)  Crossing for utility lines, including but not limited to gas, liquid, power, telephone, and other pipelines, provided that the number of crossings and the amount of vegetative disturbance are minimized; or 
                  (8)  Recreational foot trails and viewing areas, providing that impacts to the buffer are minimal. 
                  (c)  Variances will not be considered when, following the adoption of this rule, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  (d)  At a minimum, the buffer variance request shall include the following information. A request shall not be evaluated until all of these materials are received. 
                  (1)  A site map that includes locations of all state waters, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey. 
                  (2)  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property. 
                  (3)  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all structures, impervious surfaces, and the boundaries of the area of soil disturbance, both inside and outside of the buffer. The exact area of the buffer to be impacted shall be accurately and clearly indicated. 
                  (4)  A description of the project, with details of the buffer disturbance, and justification for why the disturbance is necessary. 
                  (5)  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained, if applicable. 
                  (6)  At least one alternative site plan, which does not involve buffer intrusion, or an acceptable explanation of why such a site plan is not possible. Acceptable explanations include but are not limited to a statement that the project is for a structure which cannot be located outside the buffer, such as a dock, boat ramp or other structure; or a statement that the project is for a linear utility crossing; or a statement that the project is for a sewer line and the topography is such that it is impossible to locate the line outside of the buffer. All alternative site plans must attempt to meet the same development goals as the original site plan while preventing buffer intrusion. 
                  (7)  A calculation of the total area and length of buffer disturbance. 
                  (8)  An approved erosion and sedimentation control plan, if applicable. 
                  (9)  A plan for stormwater control once site stabilization is achieved, if applicable. 
                  (10)  A letter from the issuing authority (if other than the division) stating that it is aware of the project. 
                  (11)  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the buffer disturbance. 
                  (12)  Any other reasonable information related to the project that the division may deem necessary to effectively evaluate the variance request. 
                  (13)  Application shall be on forms provided by the division. 
                  (e)  In determining whether to issue a variance, the division shall consider the following factors: 
                  (1)  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; and 
                  (2)  The locations of all state waters with vegetation wrested from the channel on the property as determined from field inspection; and 
                  (3)  The location and extent of buffer intrusion; and 
                  (4)  Whether alternative project designs, such as the use of retaining walls, are possible which do not require buffer intrusion or which require less buffer intrusion; and 
                  (5)  The long-term water-quality impacts of the proposed variance, as well as the construction impacts; and 
                  (6)  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment. 
                  (f)  When the division proposes to issue a variance, it will send out a public advisory to all citizens and groups who request to receive the advisories. The applicant will then publish a notice in the legal organ of the local jurisdiction. The public advisory and public notice shall describe the proposed buffer modification, the location of the variance, where the public can go to review site plans, and where comments should be sent. The public shall have 30 days from the date of publication of the notice in the legal organ to comment on a variance proposal. 
                  (g)  In all cases in which a buffer variance is issued, the following conditions shall apply: 
                  (1)  The variance shall be the minimum reduction in buffer width necessary to provide relief. Streams shall not be piped if a buffer width reduction is sufficient to provide relief. 
                  (2)  Disturbance of existing natural (and native) buffer vegetation shall be minimized. 
                  (3)  The division may require mitigation, the purpose of which is to offset the impacts of the buffer encroachment. Mitigation shall provide buffer functions that replace those lost by the buffer impacts. No formula is required for calculating mitigation, but the amount of mitigation shall be in proportion to the degree of expected water quality and habitat impairment. Where lost functions cannot be replaced, mitigation shall provide other buffer functions that are beneficial. Buffer functions include, but are not limited to: 
                  a.  Temperature control (shading); 
                  b.  Streambank stabilization; 
                  c.  Trapping of sediments; 
                  d.  Removal of nutrients, heavy metals, pesticides and other pollutants; 
                  e.  Aquatic habitat and food chain; 
                  f.  Terrestrial habitat, food chain and migration corridor; and 
                  g.  Buffering of flood flows. 
                  (4)  Mitigation should be on-site when possible. Depending on site conditions, acceptable forms of mitigation may include but are not limited to: 
                  a.  Restoration of the buffer to a naturally vegetated state; 
                  b.  Bioengineering of channels to reduce bank erosion and improve habitat; 
                  c.  Creation or restoration of wetlands; 
                  d.  Stormwater management to better maintain the pre-development flow regime (with consideration given to downstream effects) that exceeds the requirements of applicable ordinances; 
                  e.  Reduction in pollution sources, such as on-site water quality treatment or improving the level of treatment of septic systems; 
                  f.  Other forms of mitigation that protects or improves water quality and/or aquatic wildlife habitat; 
                  g.  An increase in buffer width elsewhere on the property; 
                  h.  Mitigation required under a Clean Water Act Section 404 or Nationwide wetlands disturbance permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  (5)  Forms of mitigation which are not acceptable include: 
                  a.  Activities which are already required by the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act, such as the minimal use of best management practices; 
                  b.  Activities, which are already required by other federal, state and local laws, except as described above. 
                  (6)  The division will not place a condition on a variance that requires a landowner to deed property or the development rights of property to the state or to any other entity. The landowner may voluntarily preserve property or the development rights of property as a mitigation option with the agreement of the division. 
                  (h)  If a variance issued by the director is acceptable to the issuing authority, the variance shall be included as a condition of permitting and therefore becomes a part of the permit for the proposed land disturbing activity project. If a variance is not acceptable to the issuing authority, the issuing authority may issue a land disturbing permit without allowing encroachment into the buffer. 
                  (i)  A general variance is provided for piping of trout streams with an average annual flow of 25 gpm or less. 
                  (j)  To obtain this general variance for encroaching on the buffer of a trout stream, the applicant must submit information to the issuing authority demonstrating that the average annual flow in the stream is 25 gpm or less. There are three acceptable methods for making this determination. 
                  (1)  The USGS unit area runoff map may be used to determine the threshold acreage that will produce an average annual flow of 25 gpm or less. Since a large portion of the runoff in small basins discharges as subsurface flow, it is appropriate to scale the resulting acreage upward. Applying a factor of 1.5 may scale the acreage determined from the USGS map upward. If the drainage area to the stream is less than the calculated threshold acreage, the average annual flow will be assumed to be 25 gpm or less. 
                  (2)  The applicant may present three base flow measurements taken between January 1 and April 15 of any calendar year, with each measurement separated by at least seven days. The measurements must be taken and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or Geologist, a Registered Surveyor, or a Licensed Soil Scientist. If the average of these three measurements is 25 gpm or less, then the average annual flow will be considered to be less than 25 gpm. 
                  (3)  The applicant may submit a hydrologic analysis certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or Geologist that presents information sufficient to estimate that the average annual flow of each stream to be piped is 25 gpm or less with a high level of certainty. 
                  (k)  Any stream piping performed in accordance with this general variance shall be subject to the following terms: 
                  (1)  The total length of stream that is piped in any one property shall not exceed 200 feet. 
                  (2)  Any project that involves more than 200 feet of piping will require an individual variance for the entire project. The general variance may not be applied to a portion of a project; e.g., it is not permissible to pipe 200 feet of a stream under the general variance and seek an individual variance for an additional length of pipe. 
                  (3)  The downstream end of the pipe shall terminate at least 25 feet before the property boundary. 
                  (4)  The applicant for a Land Disturbing Activity Permit shall notify the appropriate issuing authority of the precise location and extent of all streams piping as part of the land disturbing activity permit application. The issuing authority (if other than the division) shall compile this information and convey it to the division annually. 
                  (5)  Where piping of a stream increases the velocity of stream flow at the downstream end of the pipe, appropriate controls shall be employed to reduce flow velocity to the pre-development level. Plans for such controls must be submitted as part of the land disturbing activity permit.

                  The city makes the following findings: 
                  (1)  It is within the power of municipal corporations to establish ambient air quality standards not less stringent than those provided by the federal and state laws governing air pollution control; 
                  (2)  It is further within the power of municipal corporations to regulate the handling of solid wastes generated and collected within their jurisdiction and to impose certain restrictions upon the burning of yard trimmings which heretofore may have been collected and disposed of at municipal solid waste disposal facilities; 
                  (3)  Major land-clearing activities are temporary in nature and may be permitted under controlled conditions, provided adequate safeguards have been taken to ensure ambient air pollution is minimized; and 
                  (4)  Spotting unreported smoke in any part of the geographic limits of the municipal corporation results in sending out valuable fire suppression units and constitutes a waste of valuable public resources if a controlled fire is discovered. 
                  Sec. 42-42. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

                  DIVISION I. - GENERALLY. 

                  Sec. 46-31. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Manchester, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 5-14-2012) 
                  Sec. 46-32. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before August 5, 1986. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before March 24, 1986. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or

                  Flood proofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.

                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after August 5, 1986 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after March 24, 1986 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after March 24, 1986. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis;

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a 5-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 46-41. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
                  The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
                  (Ord. of 5-14-2012) 
                  Sec. 46-42. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The city council as established by Manchester Charter shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the code enforcement officer in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Meriwether County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The code enforcement officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 46-91. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  (i)  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  (ii)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  (iii)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 46-92. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 46-91(4), "elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in 46-63(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  (ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See section 46-91(6) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  (ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  (iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction" including the anchoring and elevation requirements of 46-92(3)a.—c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-36 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if section 46-92(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3.

                  Sec. 46-93. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-36, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 46-36, then the code enforcement officer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3 only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply; 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 46-91(4), "elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The code enforcement officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  (b)  In all cases of levying on real property, within five days written notice of the levy must be given personally, or delivered by certified mail, to the defendant in fi. fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the levy on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi. fa. 
                  (c)  Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give 20 days' written notice of the levy to the record owner of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The 20-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner of the land, the years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city clerk. 
                  (d)  When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi. fa. shall be given at least ten days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than 30 days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his delegate not less than 25 days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. 
                  (e)  The marshal shall publish weekly for four weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted an advertisement of the date, place and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the owners of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for collection of taxes due to the city and the years for which taxes have been executed. 
                  (f)  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal before the city hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Savings Time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions; and neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the city, make any representations or warranty of title, condition or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied. 
                  (g)  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this article shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy and sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired. 
                  (h)  Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered a reasonable time, the marshal may either readvertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids. 
                  (Ord. No. 95-1, § 1(19-5), 4-10-1995) 
                  Sec. 70-136. - Bidding by city at tax sales; disposition of property acquired. 
                  (a)  If during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county, and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, the city manager or his designee may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
                  (b)  Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder; however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in section 70-139. 
                  (c)  The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in the manner set forth in section 70-139.

                  (a)  The marshal shall make a prompt accounting to the city clerk for all executions placed in his hands for collection or levy and sale. He shall pay over to the clerk all amounts due the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess. 
                  (b)  In any event, within 90 days from the date executions are placed in his hands, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectible in full, he shall so notify the city clerk in writing. It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause cancellation of executions on the general execution docket of the county upon their final payment or collection. 
                  (Ord. No. 95-1, § 1(19-7), 4-10-1995) 
                  Sec. 70-138. - Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment. 
                  (a)  Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi. fa. on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city clerk, in the name of the city, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi. fa. or who has property, money or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi. fa. The clerk shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued. 
                  (b)  When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of nulla bona has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately preceding 30-day period and the city clerk has reason to believe the defendant in fi. fa. may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state, the clerk, in the name of the city, may petition the superior court of the county in this state in which the defendant in fi. fa. maintains a known residence, place of business or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi. fa. does not maintain a known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-3-1 et seq. 
                  (Ord. No. 95-1, § 1(19-8), 4-10-1995) 
                  Sec. 70-139. - Redemption rights of defendant in fi. fa.; vesting of title in grantee. 
                  (a)  Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-42, at any time within 12 months from the date of sale, and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-45, which sections by reference are incorporated in this section as a part of this article. 
                  (b)  Where notice of foreclosure of the right to redeem real property sold at a tax sale has not been given as required in subsection (a) of this section, title shall ripen by prescription after a period of four years from the date of recording of the deed in the county where the property is situated, provided the defendant in fi. fa. was not laboring under any legal disability at the time of sale. Unless the tax deed indicates a lesser interest was levied upon and sold, a fee simple title to the property shall vest absolutely in the grantee in the deed or in the grantee's heirs or assigns. If the defendant in fi. fa. is laboring under any legal disability, the prescriptive term shall begin from the time the disabilities are removed or abated. 
                  (Ord. No. 95-1, § 1(19-9), 4-10-1995) 
                  Sec. 70-140. - Costs. 
                  (a)  For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the clerk of superior court for recording and cancellation of the tax fi. fa. 
                  (b)  Once a levy is made or posted on the property of a defendant in fi. fa., in addition to all taxes, interest, penalties and costs accrued, the marshal shall collect a levy administration fee of five percent of the taxes due or $250.00, whichever is the lesser; however, no levy administration fee shall be less than $50.00. 
                  (c)  In addition to the levy administration fee, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale, not to exceed eight percent on sums of $50.00 or less, six percent on sums above $50.00 up to $550.00, and three percent on all sums exceeding $550.00. 
                  (d)  The costs provided in this section shall be cumulative and in addition to any statutory premiums allowed as a part of the redemption price.

                  (a)  Motorized carts. It shall be the duty of every owner of an electric or gasoline-powered motorized cart that is operated over designated city streets and those areas accessible by the public to register the cart with the city within ten business days of the date of purchase. Two numerical decals shall be issued upon registration; and a record of each motorized cart number, along with the name and address of the owner, shall be maintained by the city clerk's office. The decals must be affixed to the sides of the cart in such a manner as to be fully visible at all times. The failure to have a current registration decal on a motorized cart shall be a violation of this section and subject the owner of such cart to the penalties set forth in section 1-12.

The nonresident fee is due by January 31 each year until such time as the cart is sold or otherwise disposed of. This nonresident registration/user fee shall be prorated for carts purchased after January 31 of the first calendar year of ownership, unless the nonresident had previously paid the registration/user fee the same calendar year, in which case the $15.00 registration fee would be required to register and obtain decals for the new cart.

                  (4)  Transfers. Upon occurrence of a sale of the motorized cart to another person who shall operate the motorized cart over designated streets of the city, the registration must be transferred to the new owner within ten business days of the change in ownership at a cost of $5.00, and if the new owner is not a city resident, the nonresident registration/user fee for the balance of the year shall be due from the new owner. If the registration is not transferred within ten business days, a $20.00 penalty will be applied in addition to the $5.00 transfer charge; and the cart shall be considered an unregistered cart after the ten business-day period. Dealers acquiring a registered cart exclusively for resale (non-rental) shall not be required to pay the transfer charge, but shall notify the city of the transfer within ten business days of receiving the cart, and of the ultimate disposition of the cart within ten business days of sale. 
                  (5)  Special tourism events. Council may, at its discretion, waive registration requirements for special events of a limited duration to which out-of-city residents may bring carts as participants.

For purposes of this subsection, services shall be deemed accessible whenever water and/or sewer lines exist within a public street or right-of-way at the property line or within 200 feet of the property line (in which case the property owner shall bear the expense of extending the line to the property boundary), or if the city, at its expense within six months from the date of a written request for service, extends a line to the requesting property owner's boundary (upon advance payment of all required tap or connection fees). Installation of private wells for the purpose of providing water for human consumption are prohibited; however, such wells may be installed for nonconsumptive purposes upon meeting the requirements of state law. Except where permission of the city has been obtained, prior to connection of any structure to the city water system, and as an ongoing condition of the delivery of water by the city, customers shall submit their premises to inspection by the city to establish that private wells existing on the premises are not physically connected to the city water system. Customers, as a condition for the receipt of water from the city, shall agree and covenant not to permit the cross connection of any private wells or water systems to the city water system unless written permission is first obtained. 
                  (e)  Any violation of this section shall be punished, upon citation, as an offense against the city in the same manner as provided for enforcement of other codes and ordinances. In addition to such 
                  enforcement, repeat violations of this regulation shall be grounds for discontinuance of water service.

                  Sec. 78-43. - Meter reading; billings; collections. 
                  Bills to the customer for water and sewer service shall be mailed on such day each month as may be determined desirable by the city. The failure of water and sewer users to pay charges duly imposed shall result in the automatic imposition of the following penalties: 
                  (1)  Nonpayment after the due date will subject the consumer to a penalty of ten percent of the delinquent account as a late charge penalty. 
                  (2)  Accounts delinquent after the due date are subject to disconnection without further notice. Water and sewer service shall not be reconnected until the delinquent bill, including penalty and reconnection charges, have been paid in full. Reconnect fees shall be determined by the city and a schedule shall be posted at city hall. 
                  (3)  Bills shall be paid at city hall. A failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent bills from becoming delinquent or relieve the consumer from the obligation to pay the bill. 
                  (4)  Upon discontinuance of service for nonpayment of bills, the city may collect the delinquent account in the usual manner provided by law for the collection of debts.

                  Sec. 78-44. - Suspension of service. 
                  In addition to the reasons set forth in section 78-43, the city also reserves the right to discontinue service to a consumer for the following reasons: 
                  (1)  To prevent fraud or abuse; 
                  (2)  Consumer's willful disregard of the city's rules and regulations, and ordinances; 
                  (3)  Emergency repairs; 
                  (4)  Insufficiency of water supply due to circumstances beyond the control of the city; 
                  (5)  Legal processes; 
                  (6)  Direction of public authorities; or 
                  (7)  Strike, riot, fire, flood or unavoidable accident.

                  Sec. 78-45. - Complaints; adjustments. 
                  (a)  If the consumer believes his bill to be in error, he shall present his claim, in person, at the city hall before the bill becomes delinquent. Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as provided in this article. The consumer may pay such bill under protest, and such payment shall not prejudice his claim. 
                  (b)  The city will make a special water meter reading at the request of a consumer for a fee at rates to be posted at city hall. If such special reading discloses that the meter was improperly read to charge the consumer for more water than was actually used, no such charge will be made for reading the meter. 
                  (c)  Water meters will be tested at the request of the consumer upon payment to the city of the actual costs of making the test; however, if the meter is found to over register beyond three percent of the correct volume, no charge will be made. 
                  (d)  If the seal of a meter is broken by other than the city's representative or if the meter fails to register correctly or is stopped for any cause, the consumer shall pay an amount estimated from the record of his previous bills and from other proper data, if available.

                  Section 407. - Amendment of zoning ordinance and map; review standards; application procedures. 
                  407.1.  All amendments to this ordinance, either to the text or map, shall be accomplished in accordance with this chapter.

The applicant shall bear the burden of proof and persuasion. 
                  407.3.  All proposed amendments to the zoning map shall be considered in light of the following six standards used to interpret the balance between an individual's right to the unfettered use of his or her property and the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare of the community. In applying these standards, expression of public opinion unsupported by objective facts shall not be given weight by the mayor and council: 
                  A.  Whether the property to be affected by the zoning proposal has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned, although such use may not be its highest and best potential use. 
                  B.  Whether the zoning proposal will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property. 
                  C.  If not suitable, whether the zoning proposal can be conditioned so that it will not adversely affect the existing use of adjacent or nearby property. 
                  D.  Whether the zoning proposal will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools. 
                  E.  Whether there are other existing or changing conditions which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal. 
                  F.  If applicable, the length of time the property has remained vacant as zoned, considered in the context of land development in the vicinity of the property. 
                  407.4.  Amendments may be proposed by the zoning administrator, the mayor and council, PZB, any owner of property within the City of Manchester, or the owner's legal representative. 
                  407.5.  All applications for amendment shall be made in writing, on forms provided by the zoning administrator, and filed with the zoning administrator. 
                  407.6.  No application will be considered to have been accepted until such forms as described in section 407.5 have been completed and submitted to the zoning administrator for filing, with the proscribed fees. 
                  407.7.  Application forms shall include any request for information deemed necessary by the zoning administrator and may include: drawings showing the dimensions of existing and proposed buildings; entrances and exits from the property described in the application; a detailed description of existing land uses on adjacent and surrounding property; the location of the subject property, including street number, if any; a plat of the land in question, or a description by metes and bounds, bearings and distances of the land, or if the boundaries conform to the lot boundaries within a subdivision for which a plat is recorded in the land records of Meriwether County, then, the lot, block and subdivision designations with appropriate plat reference; the present and proposed zoning district classification for the subject property; the name(s) and address(es) of the owner(s) of the subject property; the area of land proposed to be rezoned, stated in square feet if less than one acre and in acres of one or more; and the application number, date of application and action taken on all prior applications filed for rezoning of all or part of the subject property. 
                  407.8.  Any communication relative to an application for amendment will be regarded as informational only until a proper and complete application for amendment is made. 
                  407.9.  Upon receipt of application for amendment, the zoning administrator shall send a copy of the application to each member of the mayor and council and of the planning and zoning board. The individual officials shall file such conflict of interest disclosures as may be required by O.C.G.A. title 36, chapter 67A. (See appendix C.) 
                  407.10.  The PZB may, but is not required to, hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment, and shall submit its recommendations to the mayor and council within 45 days of receipt of the proposed amendment from the zoning administrator.

Voluntary withdrawal shall not constitute a denial for purposes of section 407.19. In approving an ordinance, the mayor and council may require that zoning conditions be added or deleted, as recommended by the zoning administrator and PZB, or upon its own initiative. The vote of each member of the mayor and council shall be recorded in the official minutes. Any tie vote shall constitute a denial of the proposed amendment. 
                  407.13.  The mayor and council, zoning administrator, and PZB may defer action or recommendation for a reasonable length of time on any application for amendment pending submission of additional information, as requested of the applicant. Any delay must be explained to the applicant. 
                  407.14.  After final action by the mayor and council on a proposed ordinance, any necessary changes to the official map shall be made within 30 days and shall indicate the effective date of the amendment. 
                  407.15.  A temporary notation or a temporary map showing the necessary zoning map change(s) described in section 407.12 shall indicate the effective date of the amendment. 
                  407.16.  An approved amendment to the zoning map(s) becomes effective upon posting of a temporary notation or a temporary map showing the necessary zoning map change(s).

                  Section 408. - Public information. 
                  This section includes requirements for public hearings, meetings, notice, and access to records. All hearings, meetings, notice, and records relative to this zoning ordinance shall follow the procedures established in this section. 
                  408.1.  Hearings. 
                  1.  The Mayor or presiding Council Member shall indicate that a public hearing has been called for the consideration of zoning decisions. Thereupon the Council shall consider each application on an individual basis. 
                  2.  A minimum of ten minutes per side shall be afforded for presentation of data, evidence, and opinion by proponents and opponents of each zoning decision, and a five-minute rebuttal time limit for the applicant. The Council may, but shall not be obligated to, ask for a show of hands for those persons who appear in support of/opposition to the petition. If it appears that the number of persons wishing to appear in support of/opposition to the petition is in excess of that which may reasonably be heard, the Council may request that a spokesperson for the group be chosen so that the entire presentation of the positions of those in support of/opposition to the petition shall not exceed 30 minutes. 
                  3.  In the absence of the applicant at a rezoning public hearing, after hearing from those present, the public hearing may be continued to another date for further information. 
                  4.  While everyone has the right to disagree, members of the audience that are continually disruptive to and disrespectful of the purpose of the meeting, participants in the meeting, and each other are politely and respectfully urged to refrain from their actions or shall vacate the meeting. 
                  5.  After the public hearing is closed, the Council may immediately thereafter vote upon the proposed change or it may delay the vote to a subsequent meeting.

Failure to provide notice as required by this ordinance may constitute grounds for the final action on an application to be declared null and void. It is the responsibility of the applicant to satisfy himself prior to the public hearing that proper notice requirements have been met and evidenced in the record of the hearing. Appearance at the public hearing shall constitute a waiver of all claims based upon improper publication of notice or posting on the property. 
                  408.3.  Records and Minutes of Proceedings. Copies of applications, proposed ordinances, supporting documents and plats, written evaluations and recommendations by the zoning administrator and PZB, and minutes of all related proceedings shall be deemed a part of the official record. When the mayor and council conducts a public hearing on the adoption of a zoning ordinance, the amendment to the text of this ordinance, or an amendment to the classification of property as shown on the official zoning map, the mayor and council is deemed to act in a legislative capacity, and written minutes shall be taken which fairly and accurately reflect the proceedings. When acting in a quasi-judicial capacity to apply this ordinance in consideration of an application for variance, or special use written minutes shall be prepared which fairly and accurately summarize the testimony of any witness presented and which attach any documentary evidence presented at the hearing.

                  B.  The applicant shall remove any and all rezoning signs from the subject property within three business days after the date of hearing on the proposed rezoning.

Persons aggrieved by any decision of the mayor and council arising from a legislative action by the mayor and council may seek declaratory relief and/or equitable relief from the superior court of Meriwether County. Persons aggrieved by any quasi-judicial action may petition the superior court for issuance of a writ of certiorari.

                  409.2.  Extent of Authority of the Mayor and Council. The mayor and council may not, in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, reverse or modify, wholly or in part, any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator resulting in the denial of a development or construction permit where a ground for denial is that the existing zoning does not allow such proposed structure or use, or that a specific variance, special use, or continuation or enlargement of a nonconforming use is first required. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2015) 
                  Section 410. - Special uses; criteria for granting. 
                  The mayor and council shall hear and decide upon special uses. No permit shall be granted in an individual case unless a written application for a special use is submitted by the applicant indicating the section of this ordinance under which the special use is sought. All applications shall be reviewed by the PZB for recommendation. 
                  Before any special use shall be issued, the mayor and council shall consider whether satisfactory provisions and arrangement have been made concerning the following, where applicable: 
                  410.1.  Ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case of fire or catastrophe. 
                  410.2.  Off-street parking and loading areas where required, with particular attention to the items in section 410.1 above and the economic, noise, glare, or odor effects of the special use on adjoining properties and properties generally in the area. Days and hours of operation may be specified as a condition for granting the special use. 
                  410.3.  Uses involving public assemblies, such as churches, auditoriums, theatres, meeting halls, restaurants, and similar places where crowds are likely to congregate shall meet all applicable fire, life safety, sanitation and health codes, and accessibility codes for persons with disabilities. 
                  410.4.  Utilities, with reference to location, availability, and compatibility. Refuse and service areas, with particular reference to the items in sections 410.1 and 410.2 above. 
                  410.5.  Screening and buffering with reference to type, dimension, and character. 
                  410.6.  Signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic safety, economic effect, and compatibility and harmony with properties in the district and with the provisions of the Manchester Sign Ordinance as set forth in chapter 58 of Part II, Code of Ordinances. 
                  410.7.  Adequacy of required minimum yards and other open space; provided, greater buffer requirements can be imposed as a condition for granting the special use. 
                  410.8.  General compatibility of the proposed special use with adjacent properties and other land uses in the general area. 
                  410.9.  The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard or otherwise adversely affect the public interest because of: 
                  A.  The number of persons who attend or use such facility; 
                  B.  Noise or fumes generated; or 
                  C.  Type of physical activity. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2015) 
                  Section 411. - Variances. 
                  The mayor and council, upon recommendation of the PZB, may authorize, in specific cases, such variance from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special circumstances, literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance in the district in question. The variance granted shall be the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building and/or structure. No variance shall be granted in an individual case unless and until a written application for a variance is submitted by the applicant demonstrating: 
                  411.1.  There are extraordinary, exceptional or peculiar conditions and circumstances pertaining to the particular piece of land, structure or building in question which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; 
                  411.2.  The application of these regulations to a particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; 
                  411.3.  Relief, if granted, would not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations; 
                  411.4.  A literal interpretation of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of any rights that others in the same district are entitled to enjoy; 
                  411.5.  That the special conditions and circumstances alleged are not the result of any contrived actions of the applicant; and 
                  411.6.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings similarly situated. 
                  In exercising the above powers, the mayor and council shall not consider any nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same or any other district, and no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other districts as grounds for the issuance of a variance. Under no circumstances shall the mayor and council grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this ordinance in the district involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this ordinance in said district.

                  (1)  Where only one said adjoining lot contains a principal building with a nonconforming setback, the setback shall be the computed average of (a) the normal setback requirements with (b) the nonconforming setback; or 
                  (2)  Where both adjoining lots contain a principal building each with a nonconforming setback, the minimum setback shall be the computed average of the two nonconforming setbacks.

                  Whenever screening is required by this ordinance, a durable masonry wall, or fence and hedge of sufficient opacity to provide a visual blind designed to be compatible with the character of adjoining properties, shall be provided. Such fences and/or walls shall be at least six feet in height, but no greater than eight feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot lines of the adjoining properties. When hedges or natural plantings are used, (together with the fence prescribed), to form the required screening, the minimum sufficient opacity shall be deemed to require no less than three feet of plantings and/or hedge in the area immediately adjacent to the fence, measured along the ground surface from the fence to the inside border of said plantings and/or hedge plantings.

At the time of the application for a building permit, the applicant shall post a performance bond in the amount sufficient to cover the cost of installation of the required screening. If, at the end of the two-year period, the buffered screening is satisfactorily in place as prescribed in this section, the amount of the bond shall be returned to the applicant; however, if the required screening is not completed satisfactorily as set forth in this section by the end of the two-year period, the bond shall be deemed forfeited and the required screening will be installed by the City of Manchester, using the funds from the proceeds of the cash bond posted by the applicant. At the time of the application for a building permit the applicant shall execute a license to the City of Manchester on and over the land site for which application has been made, sufficient to allow the City of Manchester to enter onto the property and perform the required screening work. The zoning administrator shall make determination of the degree of satisfactory completion of required screening according to a common standard; the zoning administrator's decisions in each instance may be appealed to the mayor and council.

                  (Ord. of 1-9-2015) 
                  Section 446. - New building and housing technologies. 
                  Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed as to discriminate against solar, earth-sheltered, or other emerging building and housing technologies. No minimum height requirements for buildings or houses shall be established. 
                  Completely below grade, earth-covered spaces shall not be included in maximum lot coverage calculations since the concerns of water runoff and creating adequate open space around buildings are alleviated. Earth-sheltered designs in which the roof grade is somewhat higher than the surrounding grade may not create the desired open space and building mass relationships intended by the regulations and thus may not be exempt from the lot coverage requirements of this ordinance. 
                  No provisions are made in this ordinance which require that a building or house be oriented in a particular direction. Property owners shall be allowed to construct a building or house on their property (subject to the provisions of this ordinance), with regard to solar orientation regardless of direction from building or house to the street. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2015) 
                  Section 447. - Civil penalties. 
                  Every violation of the terms of this ordinance by any person, firm or corporation shall be deemed a nuisance, and a continuing nuisance for each day such violation may be continued and such violation may be subject to abatement as a nuisance as provided by the laws of this state and ordinances of the city. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2015) 
                  Section 448. - Criminal penalties. 
                  Any firm, person or corporation who shall intentionally do anything prohibited by this ordinance as the same exists or as it may hereafter be amended, or who shall fail to do anything required by this ordinance as it now exists or as it may hereafter be amended, shall be guilty of an offense against the city. Each and every day that such violation exists shall be deemed a separate offense. The owner of any building or premises or part thereof where anything in violation of this ordinance shall be placed or shall exist and any architect, builder, contractor or agent of the owner who may have assisted in the commission of such violation shall be tried, upon citation, before the municipal court. Upon conviction, the person or persons shall be fined not more than $1,000.00 for each offense. The guilty party shall pay all costs as determined by the court. Each day's continuance of a violation shall be considered a separate offense. Citations may be issued by the city manager, zoning administrator, city police officer, building official, or other code enforcement officer. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2015)

                  ARTICLE 5. - ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS 

                  Section 501. - Districts enumerated. 
                  For the purpose of this ordinance, the City of Manchester, Georgia, is divided into the following zoning districts: 

                   
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2015) 
                  Section 502. - Definitions of zoning districts. 
                  A.  R-E Estate Residential. This district is composed of certain areas having a very-low-density, single-family character on lots of approximately one acre and additional open area where it is desirable and likely that similar development will occur. The most stringent development requirements and restrictions in this zoning district will serve to guarantee that the area's natural beauty will not be abused as well as encourage similar development. 
                  B.  R-1 Low-Density Residential. This district is composed of certain areas having a low-density, single-family residential character and additional open area where it is desirable and likely that similar development will occur. Stricter development requirements and restrictions in this zoning district will serve to guarantee that the area's natural beauty will not be abused as well as encourage similar development. 
                  C.  R-2 Low- to Medium-Density Residential. This district is composed of certain areas having medium population and housing density, single-family residential character and additional undeveloped land where it is desirable and likely that similar development will occur. All uses permitted of right in the R-1 district are also permitted in the R-2 district. 
                  D.  R-3 Medium-Density Residential. This district is composed of certain areas having a medium population and housing density, residential character and additional undeveloped land where it is desirable and likely that similar development will occur. Multifamily residential units in the form of duplex apartments may be permitted by special use only. All uses permitted of right in the R-1 and R-2 districts are permitted in the R-3 district. 
                  E.  R-4 Medium- to High-Density Residential. This district is composed of certain areas having a high population and housing density, located where they can be well served by public and commercial facilities. Site area requirements are graduated to reflect the relative need for open space of the various types of residences based on expected family composition. Multifamily residential units in the form of duplex apartments are permitted by right. All uses permitted of right in the R-1, R-2, and R-3 districts are permitted. 
                  F.  R-5 High-Density Residential. This district is composed of certain areas having high population, located where they can be well served by public and commercial facilities. Multifamily units as well as duplex, triplex and quadraplex units are allowed in this district. Detached single-family dwelling residential housing is excluded from this district, with the exception of a manufactured home community, which may be allowed as a special use. 
                  G.  FA Forest, Agriculture. This district is intended to preserve the present rural residential character of certain land within the city, and to promote development of a type which does not require extensive public facilities and services. 
                  H.  C-1 Local Commercial. This district is composed of certain lands and structures used primarily for the retailing of goods and the furnishing of selected services to nearby residential areas. Regulations within this district are intended to permit limited development of the necessary commercial uses while at the same time protecting nearby residential properties from possible adverse effects of the business activities. At such time as the development of presently undeveloped portions of the city warrants provision of additional facilities, prior to making a recommendation to the mayor and council, the zoning board will evaluate applications for such local commercial districts on the basis of the following criteria: 
                  1.  The development of a local commercial district, at the location proposed and in the manner proposed, will not adversely affect abutting residential properties. 
                  2.  The site development plan provides for adequate vehicular and pedestrian access and circulation, and the resulting concentration of vehicular traffic will not present problems of safety or unduly impede normal traffic movement on adjacent residential streets. 
                  3.  The need for the limited commercial district is justified on the basis of facts submitted by the applicant which clearly indicates that a present or imminent trade market exists for the type and extent of facility proposed and that existing general commercial districts (or districts already zoned but not yet developed) do not adequately satisfy the need for such commercial service. 
                  I.  C-2 General Commercial. This district is composed of certain land and structures used to provide for the general retailing of goods and the furnishing of major services to the citizens of Manchester and the surrounding region. This district occupies a central location, is intended to serve a wide trade area, and offers a wide range of services and merchandise. The future expansion of this district should only occur as an increase in depth and intensity of use rather than continued strip-like extensions along major streets. It is expected that in the future most commercial uses requiring this district classification will occur as planned shopping centers occupying presently undeveloped acreage located in proximity and with access to major thoroughfares. 
                  J.  I-C Institutional-Church. This district is composed of real property owned by a recognized religious body. Further, the property owned, if consisting of more than one lot, must be contiguous to the sanctuary or in a continuum of property lots which form an unbroken continuity back to the sanctuary in order to be so designated. (A "break" caused by a street, road, or highway will not be considered a break in continuum.) Property also owned but not satisfying this definition will be designated based on its location elsewhere within the city. 
                  At such times as a religious body wishes to divest itself of such designated property or at such time as a religious body wishes to use one or more of its so-designated parcels, it may petition the planning and zoning board for a new designation of such property prior to the beginning of the disposal of the property prior to a "use" change. In this manner, the property, or the parcels, can be realigned with the contiguous district, or districts, prior to the sale or other disposal of such property, or prior to a "use" change. 
                  K.  I-G Institutional-government. This district is composed of real property owned by a government-municipal, county, state or federal. Those properties which are leased by a government will be excluded from this designation and will be designated based on the compatible uses in the surrounding area. Also excluded from this designation are properties held by a government by way of foreclosure for whatever reason. 
                  At such times as a government wishes to divest itself of such designated property, it shall petition the planning and zoning board for a new designation of such property prior to the beginning of the disposal of the property. In this manner, the property can be realigned with the contiguous district, or districts, prior to the sale or other disposal of such property. 
                  L.  I-1 Light Industrial. This district includes areas which are well adapted to industrial development but where proximity to residential or commercial districts, or other exposure, makes it desirable to limit the manner and intensity of industrial operations. The purpose of this district is to permit the normal operation of the majority of industrial uses under conditions of operation which will protect the other uses in the district as well as nearby residential and commercial uses. This district is not designed for residential use and such use is prohibited. 
                  M.  I-2 Heavy Industrial. This district includes areas which are well adapted to relatively intense forms of industrial use. Controls on the conditions of operations of plants in this district are less stringent than in the I-1 district, since location of I-2 districts makes it unlikely that they will adversely affect less intensive uses. This district is not designed for residential use and such use is prohibited. 
                  N.  Historic Business District. This classification shall serve as an overlay within the C-1 and C-2 commercial districts to recognize and protect those buildings and structures having historic significance or otherwise qualifying for historic preservation tax-credits. In addition to meeting all criteria of the zoning classification in which the building or structure is situated, further regulations as established by a historic preservation ordinance, which ordinance shall identify or classify affected properties, shall apply. 
                  O.  Flood Hazard/Wetland/Slope Protection. This classification shall serve as an overlay within every zoning district to recognize and protect environmentally sensitive lands subject to flooding, statutory wetlands (where determination of the wetland has been made known to the city), and those areas where due to topography, degree of slope and soil conditions there exists an increased likelihood of environmental damage. Permitting by the city for land disturbing activities, including grading, clear-cutting of timber, and construction activities, may be limited or prohibited by applicable federal and state laws. It is incumbent on every property owner and applicant for a development activity permit within the city to familiarize himself with these laws and their applicability to the subject property. It is not the duty of city officials to assess or evaluate construction plans for applicability of these laws, nor shall the city, its officers and employees, be liable in money damages to any owner or applicant who seeks or secures its permission to engage in any prohibited activity on or affecting such lands. Overlaying of areas previously identified or determined by the proper regulatory agency on the official zoning maps of the City of Manchester is intended to be a public service only and to place property owners on notice of those areas where special development criteria may be applicable. 
                  A flood hazard area shall correspond to area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on its most recent official flood hazard maps for the area encompassing the City of Manchester in Meriwether and Talbot counties. General construction within an identified flood hazard area is prohibited, except as meets the criteria of federal, state and local flood management regulations. 
                  A statutory wetland is defined as "those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions." This definition requires evidence of three conditions: (1) presence of water during the growing season, (2) presence of hydric soil, and (3) a prevalence of vegetation adaptive to wet conditions. Permitting of activities in or adjacent to statutory wetlands, and the enforcement of violations of the laws pertaining to wetland protection is within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
                  Recognizing the existence of the Pine Mountain Ridge within the corporate limits of the City of Manchester, certain federal and state regulations may restrict, limit, or prohibit development activities where the degree of slope is so steep as to increase the likelihood of damage to the environment. Factors such as soil type, subsurface conditions, and natural vegetation may influence applicability of these laws and regulations to a specific property. It is the policy of the city to encourage sound and reasonable stewardship of the land, particularly in a manner which protects water quality from runoff that creates erosion and carries sedimentation, while balancing that interest against the owner's right to the use and enjoyment of his property. Persons applying to the city for permits to engage in land-disturbing activities or to permit construction on the Pine Mountain Ridge are encouraged to familiarize themselves with all pertinent laws and regulations and seek compliance therewith prior to applying for a permit from the city. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2015)

                  C.  All materials, equipment, labor and other matters related to street construction shall be provided by the developer. The following is a summary of the improvements required: 
                  1.  Grading. All streets, roads, and alleys shall be graded to their full width right-of-way by the subdivider so that the pavements and sidewalks, when installed in the future, can be constructed on the same level plane. The preparation of the right-of-way before grading is started and the construction of cuts and fills shall be accomplished according to the specifications of the city. 
                  All stumps, tree limbs, and other organic material shall be removed from the rights-of-way and building site areas and disposed of in accordance with law in a permitted landfill. No stumps, limbs or other organic material, including building debris, scrap lumber, etc., shall be buried anywhere in the subdivision development. In developments over ten acres, the city manager may issue a permit authorizing burning, using approved pit burners; provided all other state and local regulatory permits are first obtained and the city is not under a burn warning or hazardous air conditions alert. 
                  2.  [Profile.] Three copies of an as-built subgrade centerline profile shall be submitted. The profile shall include both proposed and as-built centerline elevations at every even station. No curb and gutter or waterlines shall be installed prior to subgrade approval. 
                  3.  Storm damage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary curb, pipes, culverts, headwalls, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, swale ditches, and detention areas, shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water and prepared by a registered professional engineer or landscape architect. 
                  4.  Roadway surfacing. After preparation of the subgrade the roadbed shall have base material and paving applied according to city specifications. 
                  Section 4.24. - Construction requirements for residential subdivisions streets. 
                  A.  The design and construction requirements for residential subdivisions shall comply with the minimum standards shown in table 4-1. 
                  B.  The grading, base and pavement for residential street construction shall be as follows: 
                  1.  Grading. All streets shall be graded to the elevations shown on the approved construction plans. 
                  a.  Clearing and grubbing. After the development permit has been issued, a preconstruction conference has been held, the city engineer duly notified, and all required silt and erosion control measures installed and approved, the contractor may begin clearing and grubbing the project. All trees, stumps, logs, roots, grass, weeds, poles, and other objectionable matter shall be cleared and grubbed from within the construction limits of the project. A 30-foot undisturbed buffer shall be maintained on all property lines prior to submission of construction improvements plans. No rubbish or other material resulting from the clearing and grubbing of the roadway may be buried within the construction limits of the roadway or detention ponds. If burning is permitted, all burn pits must be located outside of the roadway construction limits. 
                  b.  Excavation. All grading operations shall be planned and executed by the contractor in such a manner as to provide suitable subgrade material in the top 12 inches of the roadway. In areas where the material in place is not suitable for subgrades, these areas shall be undercut a minimum of 12 inches and backfilled with suitable material. All rock and boulders in the roadbed shall be excavated to a depth of at least 12 inches below the subgrade and the space backfilled to the correct grade with suitable material. Any stones, broken rock, or boulders resulting from the grading of the roadway may not be placed in any roadway fill area except when approved by the development inspector and then under his supervision. During the construction of the roadway on a day to day basis, the roadbed edges shall be kept lower than the center and the grading shall be done so that the surfaces of the excavated areas and fill will be kept reasonably smooth and well drained. Adequate surface ditches shall be cut at the tops of cut slopes, extending to each end of the cuts in order to carry the water from the side hill. Side ditches or gutters emptying from cuts to fill areas shall be turned outward so as to prevent erosion of the fill slopes. 
                  c.  Placement of fill. Fill construction shall not begin until all clearing and grubbing of the fill area has been completed. All depressions in the ground shall be filled level with the adjacent surface using suitable material and compacted to the approximate density of the surrounding soil before placement of the fill is begun. The entire area upon which fill is to be placed shall be plowed, scarified, and finely broken up to a depth of a minimum of six inches. Before the placement of fill material is begun, all loosened soil shall be compacted the approximate density of the underlying soil. Where a depth of fill and surfacing is three feet or less, the original ground shall be compacted the approximate density of the underlying soil. Where a depth of fill and surfacing is three feet or less, the original ground shall be compacted a minimum 12 inches deep to at least 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density as determined from representative samples of the material being compacted. In areas where layers of organic or other unstable materials exists, the existing ground shall be excavated, for the full width of the fill area, to an underlying stable material. The subgrade thus created shall then be compacted to the approximate density of the underlying material. All fill material shall be deposited and spread in uniform horizontal layers, not more than six inches thick, for the full width of the fill area, and these layers shall be kept uniform by the use of graders, bulldozers or other approved equipment. Each layer shall be compacted within the range of optimum moisture content necessary to achieve the compaction required. Material containing too much water shall be dried to the correct moisture content. If the material is too dry, water shall be added and uniformly mixed with the soil before it is compacted. Fills shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density to within the top 12 inches of the fill. The top 12 inches of the fill shall be compacted to at least 100 percent of the maximum dry density. The entire roadbed shall be scarified and compacted with a sheep's foot or other approved rollers. While the work is in progress, [the] contractor shall maintain the surface in a manner so that the excavation, fills, subgrade, base course, and ditches always present a smooth and even surface. 
                  d.  [Equipment on site]. The contractor shall have available on the job at all times at least one motor patrol grader with adequate power to blade and maintain the roadbed. Suitable scarifiers shall also be available for use whenever necessary. 
                  e.  Final finishing of roadway. After all excavation has been completed and all fills have been placed, the entire road bed surface shall be finally shaped with a grading machine supplemented with hand work whenever required, to secure a smooth surface and uniform cross-section. Slopes of cuts and fills shall also be carefully shaped to the true section specified. When final shaping is finished, the road surface shall conform accurately to the line, grade and cross section shown of plans, and no roots, sod, grass, stones, or other unsuitable material shall remain in the top 12 inches of the finished road bed. All ditches and drains shall be opened to effectively drain the roadway. 
                  2.  Placement of curb and gutter. After sanitary sewer and water lines have been installed, all storm drainage in place, and the final finishing of the roadway has been approved by the city engineer, the installation of the concrete curb and gutter may begin. All concrete curb and gutter shall be in accordance with Manchester construction standards. Any curb and gutter which does not conform to a true section, texture, line and grade shall be removed and replaced as directed by the development inspector. 
                  3.  Subgrade. Before placing any pavement base the entire surface of the subgrade shall be plowed, harrowed, and mixed to a depth of at least six inches. If a subgrade stabilization material is required it shall be incorporated into the subgrade at this time. After the material has been thoroughly mixed the subgrade shall be brought into a proper line and grade and compacted to 100 percent of maximum dry density just prior to placing the base material. The centerline profile shall conform to the established elevations with an acceptable tolerance of one-half inch. The acceptance crown tolerance shall be one-half inch. 
                  4.  Base construction. The city engineer shall be notified 24 hours prior to the placing of any of the base material. After the inspector is satisfied all the equipment necessary for the proper construction of road base is on the proper line, grade, and crown, and compacted to the required density, he may authorize the placing of the base material. After the base material has been placed and compacted to the required density the city engineer will check the completed base course. All areas found to be deficient shall be marked and corrected before any asphalt pavement is placed. Areas where the crown is found to exceed that which is specified or the exposed edge of the concrete gutter is less than the minimum depth required, shall be reshaped and rolled to obtain the required cross-section. After the compacted material has been approved, cores shall be taken as directed by the development inspector to determine the thickness of the constructed base course. Areas found to be deficient in thickness shall be corrected as directed by the development inspector. A copy of all delivery tickets for the graded aggregate base material shall be furnished prior to the placing [of] any asphaltic concrete paving material. A shortage in the base material used shall require that the asphaltic concrete surface course thickness be increased. All work and materials shall be in accordance with the pertinent Graded Aggregate Construction sections of the Georgia Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications..." latest edition. 
                  5.  Paving. After the road base has been accepted by the development inspector and upon his approval the contractor shall begin the construction of the asphaltic concrete pavement. All asphaltic concrete material and construction shall be in accordance with the Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction sections of the Georgia Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications..." latest edition. After the material has been placed and rolled to the satisfaction of the inspector he shall check the cross section of the finished pavement. Any area found to be deficient shall be marked and a record of deficiencies made by the development inspector. 
                  6.  [ Overlay. ] If, in the opinion of the city engineer, the extent of deficiencies will impair the performance of the pavement, he shall direct that an overlay of a minimum thickness of one inch be placed before the roadway is opened to traffic. A copy of the delivery tickets for the asphaltic concrete material used shall be furnished to the development inspector at the time of completion of the work. If the delivery tickets indicate a shortage in the material used from the quantity estimated the development inspector may require a minimum one inch overlay of the streets. 
                  7.  [ Core tests. ] Upon acceptance of the surface course by the city engineer, the developer shall have core tests made as directed by the city, to verify the thickness of the street base and asphalt pavement. If these indicate a deficiency in thickness of the street base and asphalt pavement an overlay shall be required when the following deficiencies occur: 
                  a.  When the number of cores deficient in thickness with the allowable one-quarter of an inch tolerance exceeds 35 percent of the total cores taken on one street. 
                  b.  When two or more consecutive tests show a deficiency of more than one-quarter of an inch allowable tolerance. When a core shows a deficiency in excess of the allowable tolerance additional cores will be taken to delineate the area of the deficient thickness. 
                  c.  Any required overlay shall extend a minimum of 150 feet beyond the outer limits of the deficient area for the full width of the street. Smooth, neat joints shall be saw cut normal to the roadway for full depth of asphalt pavement, removing the original pavement overlay.
