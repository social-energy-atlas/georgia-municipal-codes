         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the County of Wilkes County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the county board. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments

                  The publisher is most grateful to Karen Burton, County Administrator, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

               <p>
                  Sec. 1-1. - Designation and citation of Code. 
                  The ordinances embraced in the following chapters and sections shall constitute and be designated "The Code of Wilkes County, Georgia," and may be so cited. This Code may also be cited as the "Wilkes County Code." 
                  State Law reference— Codification requirements, O.C.G.A. § 36-80-19. 
                  Sec. 1-2. - Definitions and rules of construction. 
                  The following definitions and rules shall apply to all ordinances of the board of commissioners, unless the context requires otherwise: 
                  Generally. The ordinary signification shall be applied to all words, except words of art, or words connected with a particular trade or subject matter, when they shall have the signification attached to them by experts in such trade, or with reference to such subject matter. In all interpolations, the courts shall look diligently for the intention of the county commission, keeping in view, at all times, the old law, the evil and the remedy. Grammatical errors shall not vitiate, and a transposition of words and clauses may be resorted to when the sentence or clause is without meaning as it stands. While subpart A is a codification of general ordinances and subpart B is a codification of ordinances pertaining to land development, provisions in subpart A may also apply to land development and provisions in subpart B may also apply to activities other than land development. The failure to include in subpart B provisions that relate to land development does not excuse noncompliance with such provisions. The inclusion in subpart B of provisions that relate to activities other than land development does not excuse noncompliance with such provisions. 
                  Liberal construction; minimum requirements; overlapping provisions. All general provisions, terms, phrases and expressions contained in this Code shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of the board of commissioners may be fully carried out. In the interpretation and application of any provision of this Code, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. Where any provision of this Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject matter than the other provisions of this Code, the provision imposing the greater restriction or regulation shall be deemed to be controlling. 
                  Adequate. The term "adequate" means equal to what is required, suitable to the case or occasion, fully sufficient, proportionate or satisfactory. 
                  Aforesaid. The term "aforesaid" usually means next before. 
                  All. The term "all" means everyone, or the whole number of particulars. 
                  Also. The term "also" means "in like manner," "likewise," "in addition," "besides," "as well," "further," "too." 
                  As soon as possible. The term "as soon as possible" means within a reasonable time, having due regard to all the circumstances. 
                  At. The term "at" may mean "in," "near," "within," or "about." Its primary idea is nearness, and it is less definite than "in" or "on." 
                  Board of commissioners, board, commissioners, commission, county commission, governing authority and governing body. The terms "board of commissioners," "board," "commissioners," "commission," "county commission," "governing authority" and "governing body" mean the board of commissioners of Wilkes County, Georgia. 
                  Code. The term "Code" means The Code of Wilkes County, Georgia, as designated in section 1-1. 
                  Computation of time. When a period of time measured in days, weeks, months, years, or other measurements of time except hours is prescribed for the exercise of any privilege or the discharge of any duty, the first day shall not be counted but the last day shall be counted; and, if the last day falls on Saturday or Sunday, the party having such privilege or duty shall have through the following Monday to exercise the privilege or to discharge the duty. When the last day prescribed for such action falls on a public and legal holiday as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 1-4-1, the party having the privilege or duty shall have through the next business day to exercise the privilege or to discharge the duty. When the period of time prescribed is less than seven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation 
                  Commission. Wherever the term "commission" is used, the same shall be held to mean the "county commissioners of Wilkes County." 
                  Conjunctions. In a provision involving two or more items, conditions, provisions or events, which items, conditions, provisions or events are connected by the conjunction "and," "or" or "either…or," the conjunction shall be interpreted as follows, except that in appropriate cases the terms "and" and "or" are interchangeable: 
                  (1)  "And" indicates that all the connected terms, conditions, provisions or events apply. 
                  (2)  "Or" indicates that the connected terms, conditions, provisions or events apply singly or in any combination. 
                  (3)  "Either…or" indicates that the connected terms, conditions, provisions or events apply singly but not in combination.

                  (a)  The catchlines of the several sections of this Code printed in boldface type are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of such sections, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted. 
                  (b)  The history or source notes appearing in parentheses after sections in this Code are not intended to have any legal effect but are merely intended to indicate the source of matter contained in the section. Cross references, state enabling legislation references, state law references and editor's notes which appear after sections or subsections of this Code or which otherwise appear in footnote form are provided for the convenience of the user of this Code and have no legal effect. 
                  (c)  All references to chapters, articles or sections are to the chapters, articles and sections of this Code unless otherwise specified. 
                  State Law reference— Notes and catchlines of code sections not part of law, O.C.G.A. § 1-1-7.

                  (a)  All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein, or in the case of repealed chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby, and the subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new code of ordinances by the commission. 
                  (b)  Every proposed ordinance shall be read twice, once at each of two distinct meetings of the commission, except that both the first and second readings thereof shall be done by reading the caption thereof only, unless, upon motion and a majority vote of the commission, the commission requests the reading of the proposed ordinance in its entirety; provided, however, that the commission may provide that the proposed ordinance be read in its entirety at only the first or second reading thereof; further provided, that at any reading of a proposed ordinance, the mayor or other presiding officer may require that a synopsis be given of the proposed ordinance, either before or after the reading thereof. In case of emergency, an ordinance may be read twice by unanimous consent at the same session and passed. The reading of a proposed ordinance, in the event of such emergency, shall be done in the same manner as other proposed ordinances, in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
                  (c)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code should be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section of this Code in substantially the following language: "That section ____________ of The Code of Wilkes County, Georgia, is hereby amended to read as follows:…." The new provisions shall then be set out in full as desired. 
                  (d)  In the event a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added, the following language may be used: "That The Code of Wilkes County, Georgia, is hereby amended by adding a section (or article, chapter or other designation as the case may be), to be numbered ____________ , which reads as follows:…." The new provisions shall then be set out in full as desired. 
                  (e)  All sections, articles, chapters or other provisions of this Code desired to be repealed should be specifically repealed by section number, article number, chapter or other number, as the case may be. 
                  Sec. 1-8. - Supplementation of Code. 
                  (a)  By contract or by county personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the board of commissioners. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the commission or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
                  (b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
                  (c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles;

                  State Law reference— Governing authority has power to enact legislation to restrict operation of adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, and adult movie houses to areas zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3; establishment, maintenance or use of building, structure or place for unlawful sexual purposes, O.C.G.A. § 41-3-1. 

                  Sec. 10-19. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose; intent. The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments as defined herein, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse effect on property values and on the public health, safety, and welfare of the county, and on its citizens and property, and on the character and preservation of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business, establishment, or activity which would otherwise be unlawful. 
                  (b)  Findings. Based on the experience of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta, Georgia, Fulton County, Georgia, DeKalb County, Georgia, Richmond County, Georgia, Floyd County, Georgia, Amarillo, Texas, Austin, Texas, Garden Grove, California, Houston, Texas, Renton, Washington, Phoenix, Arizona, Augusta, Georgia, LaGrange, Georgia, Dalton, Georgia, Whitfield County, Georgia, Carrollton, Georgia, Smyrna, Georgia, Rome, Georgia, Bartow County, Georgia, and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences are believed to be relevant to the problems faced by Wilkes County, Georgia, the Wilkes County Board of Commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed in the unincorporated limits of the county and prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in said establishment is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, this article is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted.

                  Sec. 16-20. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 06102010, art. 1, § B, 6-10-2010) 
                  Sec. 16-21. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (1)  Protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  Ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any article requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement. 
                  (1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be: 
                  a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  (2)  The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  (3)  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
                  a.  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (ref. section 16-35(6)). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a.3 of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-25 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of sections 16-35 through 16-40.

                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 16-25, then the code enforcement officer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this section, sections 16-35, 16-36 and 16-38 through 16-41. Only if data are not available from these sources, then subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: The lowest floor is required to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-35(4). 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  (a)  The county planning commission as established by the county board of commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the code enforcement officer in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The code enforcement officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  (Ord. No. 05122011SESAPCO, § III, 5-12-2011) 
                  Sec. 16-107. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsection (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Best management practices. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in this subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The local issuing authority (LIA) may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15) and (16) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  Minimum requirements. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this section, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12 (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12 (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Additional requirements. Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  Presumption of violations. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 05122011SESAPCO, § IV, 5-12-2011) 
                  Sec. 16-108. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county without first obtaining a permit from the county planning commission to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD, if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the county planning commission and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 16-107(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10 (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. R 391-3-7-.10). 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 16-107(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 16-107(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 16-107(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 05122011SESAPCO, § V, 5-12-2011) 
                  Sec. 16-109. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The county code enforcement officer (or designee) will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.). 
                  (c)  The code enforcement officer (or designee) shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 16-110. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning. 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order. 
                  (3)  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 16-108(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  (b)  For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission present on-site whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 
                  (c)  Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on-site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this article. 
                  (d)  If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said subsection.

                  (a)  Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the local issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any article; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the planning commission within 30 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of written notice of appeal. 
                  (b)  Judicial review. Any person, aggrieved by a decision or order of the local issuing authority, after exhausting his administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal de novo to the superior court of the county.

                  (a)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (b)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (c)  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 18-1. - Enactment clause. 
                  For the purpose of promoting health and general welfare; securing safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; providing adequate light and air; preventing overcrowding of land; preserving the character of the area and its peculiar suitability for particular uses; promoting desirable living conditions; protesting against blight and depreciation; and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and other structures throughout such area, the board of county commissioners does ordain and enact into law the following sections. 
                  (Ord. No. 041389C, art. I, 4-13-1989) 
                  Sec. 18-2. - Short title. 
                  These regulations shall be known as and may be cited as "The Mobile Home Regulations of Wilkes County, Georgia." 
                  Sec. 18-3. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Accessory use means a use customarily incidental to the principal use of the land. 
                  Family means one or more persons occupying a dwelling and living as a single housekeeping unit, as distinguished from persons occupying a house, lodginghouse, or hotel, as herein defined. 
                  Lot means a parcel of land containing a minimum of 43,560 square feet occupied by one or more main buildings and its accessory buildings with such open and parking spaces as are required by the provisions of this chapter and having its frontage upon a public road, public street or streets, having access from a public street or public road. 
                  Mobile home means a movable or portable dwelling unit constructed to be towed on its own chassis, connected to utilities and designed without permanent foundation for year-round occupancy, which can consist of one or more components that can be retracted for towing purposes and subsequently expanded for additional capacity, or two or more units separately towable but designed to be joined into one integral unit. Removal of wheels does not change the classification of said dwelling. Construction of permanent improvements and attachments can change the classification of a mobile home to that of a modular building. The term "mobile home," as used in this chapter, shall have the same meaning as "manufactured home." 
                  Mobile home park means any parcel of land on which is customarily placed three or more mobile homes for a longer period of time than 30 days for rental purposes.

                  Plat means a map, plan or layout of a county, city, town, section, subdivision, or development indicating the location and boundaries of properties. 
                  Principal use means the primary purpose for which land or a building is used. 
                  Right-of-way line means the dividing line between a lot, tract or parcel of land and a contiguous right-of-way.

                  Sec. 24-137. - Groundwater recharge area protection district. 
                  (a)  Intent. 
                  (1)  In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  (2)  The objectives of this section are to: 
                  a.  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  b.  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
                  c.  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality. 
                  (b)  Establishment of district. A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. 
                  (c)  Pollution susceptibility. All recharge areas within the county have a medium pollution susceptibility, as indicated by the state pollution susceptibility map prepared by the state department of natural resources. 
                  (d)  Permit requirements and enforcement. The county will approve no redistricting request or subdivision plan unless the request or plan is in compliance with the groundwater protection standards listed in subsection (e) of this section. 
                  (1)  Enforcement. The county, its agent, officers, and employees shall have authority to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing their duties under this article and may take or cause to be made such examinations, surveys or sampling as the county deems necessary: 
                  a.  The county commission shall have authority to enforce this article; issue permits hereunder; and address violations or threatened violations hereof by issuance of violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator. 
                  b.  Any person who commits, takes part in, or assists in any violation of any provision of this section shall be fined not more than $500.00 for each offense. Each violation shall be a separate offense and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense. 
                  c.  The county commission shall have the authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction as identified in chapter 8. 
                  d.  When a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this section, the violator shall be required to remove the structure. 
                  e.  When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this section, the violator shall be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation as far as practicable. 
                  (2)  Permit review and site plan requirement. With the exception of certain exempted activities identified in subsection (d)(4) of this section, applications for a development permit within the groundwater recharge area district shall include a site plan. The following information is required for all site plans: 
                  a.  A map, drawn to a scale of one inch equals 50 feet or other approved scale, showing all planned improvements including the width, depth, and length of all existing and proposed structures, roads, watercourses and drainage ways, water lines, wastewater and stormwater facilities, and utility installations shall be provided by the applicant. 
                  b.  Location, dimensions and areas of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site. 
                  c.  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
                  d.  Elevation of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than five feet. 
                  e.  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. 
                  f.  Calculations of the amount of cut and fill proposed and cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades in areas of fill or excavation. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on cross-sectional drawings. 
                  (3)  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform to the specifications of said site plan. Significant changes to the site plan that would alter the amount and velocity of stormwater runoff from the site, increase the amount of impervious surface within the development, alter the overall density of development, result in a considerable increase in the amount of excavation, fill or removal of the overall appearance of the development as proposed, can be amended only with the approval of the county commission. Minor changes, such as the realignment of streets or minor alterations to drainage structures and other infrastructure to meet unexpected conditions are exempted from this requirement. 
                  (4)  Exemptions to site plan requirements. The following activities and developments are exempt from the requirement for detailed site plans: 
                  a.  Single-family detached homes constructed within a subdivision of fewer than five parcels. 
                  b.  Repairs to a facility that is part of a previously approved and permitted development. 
                  c.  Construction of minor structures, such as sheds or additions to single-family residences. 
                  (5)  Review procedures. The application shall be made to the county commission and will be reviewed within 45 days. The review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval) by the county commission. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings of the county commission. If the review process is not completed within 45 days, the application is considered to be approved. Decisions of the county commission may be appealed to the county superior court. 
                  (6)  Public notice and public hearing. Public notice of permit applications, through publication in local newspapers, is required. A public hearing on the application, to be held before the county may be scheduled if requested by a citizen. Public announcement of the hearing shall be printed in a legal organ of general circulation at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the hearing. A record of the proceedings shall be made and kept on file by the county. Any person may testify at the hearing. Decisions of the county may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction as identified in subsection (f) of this section. 
                  (7)  Duration of permit validity. 
                  a.  If construction described in the development permit has not commenced within six months from the date of issuance, the permit shall expire. 
                  b.  If construction described in the development permit is suspended or abandoned after work has commenced, the permit shall expire six months after the date that work ceased. 
                  c.  Written notice of pending expiration of the development permit shall be issued by the building inspector. 
                  (e)  Groundwater protection standards. 
                  (1)  Waste disposal facilities. Waste disposal facilities are prohibited within significant groundwater recharge areas. 
                  (2)  Requirements for agricultural compounds. New agricultural impoundment sites are prohibited within significant groundwater recharge areas. 
                  (3)  Hazardous waste disposal facilities. No land disposal of hazardous waste shall be permitted within any significant groundwater recharge area. 
                  (4)  Hazardous waste handling and storage.

                  (Ord. No. 031704, § VIII, § 8.1, 3-17-2004) 
                  Sec. 24-138. - Wetland protection district. 
                  (a)  Intent. 
                  (1)  The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is therefore necessary for the county to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (2)  The purpose of this district is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this district is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
                  (b)  Jurisdiction and boundaries of district. 
                  (1)  Generally. This section shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the county. A generalized wetlands map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the clerk of the county. 
                  (2)  Boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and the wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1344), as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (c)  Local development permits. 
                  (1)  Permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the Wetland Protection district without written permission from the county in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (c)(2) of this section shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 200 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the county or authorized designee using the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
                  (2)  Permitted and prohibited uses. 
                  a.  The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein:

                  (Ord. No. 031704, § VIII, § 8.2, 3-17-2004) 
                  Sec. 24-139. - Flood hazard district. 
                  (a)  Intent. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (2)  It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  a.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  b.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  c.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  d.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  e.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (3)  The objectives of this section are to: 
                  a.  Protect human life and health. 
                  b.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains. 
                  c.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas. 
                  d.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects. 
                  e.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  f.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions. 
                  g.  Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
                  h.  Utilize a map showing floodprone areas inclusive of a 500-foot buffer. The map is intended to be used as a basic guide and should not be the only determining factor used to declare the floodprone area. The floodprone areas designated on the map are not all inclusive or exclusive. 
                  i.  Encourage the use of a qualified surveyor to determine floodprone areas and so designate on plats developed by the surveyor. 
                  (b)  Lands to which this section applies. This section shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the county. 
                  (c)  Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
                  (1)  The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study (FIS), when available, dated (shall always be the latest date adopted or revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency), with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for the unincorporated area of the county are hereby adopted by reference. 
                  (2)  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. The county will utilize a map showing floodprone areas inclusive of a 500-foot buffer. The map is intended to be used as a basic guide and should not be the only determining factor used to declare the floodprone areas. The floodprone areas designated on the map are not all inclusive or exclusive. The county's map was created by the CSRA Regional Development Center GIS Specialist following general guidelines comparable to those used by FEMA and GEMA. The map was presented to a review committee, who recommended formal approval by the county board of commissioners. 
                  (d)  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this section prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
                  (e)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations. 
                  (f)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this section and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
                  (g)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this section, all provisions shall be: 
                  (1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
                  (2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
                  (3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
                  (h)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
                  (1)  The degree of flood protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. 
                  (2)  This section does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of the county or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
                  (i)  Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this section or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this section or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the board of county commissioners from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
                  (j)  Enforcement. The magistrate's court of the county shall have jurisdiction over violations of this section and all procedures for enforcement of this section shall be as provided in O.C.G.A. article 4, chapter 10, title 15 (O.C.G.A. § 15-10-60 et seq.). Complaints of violations of any provision contained herein shall be brought before the magistrate's court on a citation issued by the code enforcement officer or by a law enforcement officer. Citations shall meet all the official requirements as specified in O.C.G.A. § 15-10-63, as amended. 
                  (k)  Administration. 
                  (1)  Designation of ordinance administrator. The county ordinance control officer is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this section. 
                  (2)  Permit procedures.

                  a.  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-35(4). 
                  b.  Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 16-34(6). 
                  c.  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  1.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: 
                  (i)  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  (ii)  In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  (iii)  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  (iv)  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  2.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  (ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  3.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (see section 16-35(6)). 
                  4.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  (ii)  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements listed above. 
                  d.  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  1.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  2.  Only if section 16-35 is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 16-35. 
                  (3)  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  a.  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 16-25, then the ordinance control officer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of the floodway district. Only if data are not available from these sources, then subsection (l)(3)b and (3)c of this section shall apply. 
                  b.  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  c.  1.  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of the "elevated buildings" section. 
                  2.  The ordinance control officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (4)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Areas of special flood hazard may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet aboveground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  a.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of elevated buildings. The ordinance control officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  b.  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required. 
                  c.  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  (5)  Standards for subdivisions. 
                  a.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  b.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  c.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
                  d.  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less.

                  Sec. 32-23. - Septic tanks. 
                  (a)  Minimum design and construction. Septic tanks shall be designed and constructed to equal or exceed minimum design and construction criteria established by the department as published in the current manual for on-site sewage management systems. Any person seeking approval of septic tanks to be used in on-site sewage management systems after the effective date of these rules, shall submit detailed plans and specifications for tank manufacture and such other information as may be required by the county board of health. Manufacturers and suppliers shall be subject to periodic inspection, and approved by the county board of health. 
                  (b)  Location. No septic tank shall be installed less than 50 feet from existing or proposed wells/springs, or suction water lines, and tanks shall be located downgrade from wells/or springs if physically possible; less than 25 feet from lakes, ponds, streams, watercourses, or sink holes; less than ten feet from pressure water supply lines, or less than ten feet from a property line. No septic tank shall be installed less than 15 feet from a drainage ditch or embankment. Septic tanks shall be installed so as to provide ready access for necessary maintenance. Normally, the desired distance a septic tank should be located from a building foundation is at least ten feet but if conditions permit, lesser distances may be allowed by the county board of health. The county board of health, after site inspection, may require greater separation distances than cited herein due to unusual conditions of topography, or other site configuration; subsurface soil characteristics and/or groundwater interference. 
                  (c)  Capacity. The liquid capacity of septic tanks for single-family dwellings shall be not less than 750 gallons for one or two bedrooms; 900 gallons for three bedrooms; 1,000 gallons for four bedrooms and 250 additional gallons for each bedroom over four. The liquid capacity of septic tanks in on-site sewage management systems for nonresidential usage shall be based on the anticipated daily sewage flow from the facility served, but in no case shall be less than 750 gallons. Septic tank capacity shall be increased by 50 percent where garbage grinders are to be used. 
                  (d)  Compartmented tanks. Compartmented tanks are permissible upon approval by the county board of health. 
                  (e)  Tanks in series. The county board of health may approve the installation of two septic tanks placed in series provided that the capacity of the first tank is at least 750 gallons and at least equal to the capacity of the second tank. When tanks in series are used, they shall be connected with a sealed sewer line, and all sewage shall initially enter the first tank. 
                  (f)  Foundation and backfill. Septic tanks shall be constructed or installed level, on a foundation that will prevent settling; backfill shall be placed so that a stable fill results and undue strain on the tank is avoided. Earth backfill shall be free of voids, large stones, stumps, broken masonry, or other such materials. A minimum earth cover of six inches over the tank is recommended. All openings and manholes shall be constructed so as to prevent the entrance of surface water.

                  Sec. 32-24. - Distribution boxes and dosing tanks. 
                  (a)  Minimum design and construction boxes. Distribution boxes shall be designed and constructed in accordance with minimum design and construction criteria established in the department's current manual and section 32-25(d)(1). Approval procedures shall follow the requirements as set forth under section 32-23(a). 
                  (b)  Minimum design and construction of dosing tanks. Where required, dosing tanks shall be designed, constructed, and installed in accordance with the department's current manual. 
                  (Res. No. 05081997, att. C(290-5-26-.06), 5-8-1997) 
                  Sec. 32-25. - Absorption fields. 
                  (a)  Area computation. Absorption trench bottom area shall be based upon the anticipated volume of treated sewage and upon the characteristics of the soil in which absorption fields are to be located as specified in the current on-site sewage management system manual. Soil characteristics and other related data, including percolation tests, may be required by the county board of health. 
                  (b)  Location. No absorption field shall be constructed less than 100 feet from existing or proposed wells or springs; less than ten feet from water supply lines; less than ten feet from building foundations and property lines; less than 15 feet from an embankment nor less than 50 feet from the normal water level of any impoundment, tributary, stream, or other body of water. If it becomes necessary for the absorption field to be crossed by a water supply line, the water supply line within ten feet of the absorption field shall be at least 12 inches above the top of the aggregate layer of the absorption line and shall be encased in a single length of water pipe. No absorption field shall be installed in areas where groundwater, soil characteristics or adverse geological formation may interfere with the absorption of sewage effluent. 
                  (c)  Minimum design and construction for conventional septic tank systems. Absorption lines and absorption trench bottoms shall be true to grade and trenches shall be not less than 25 inches in depth, and shall have not less than 12 inches of earth cover. Maximum length of absorption trench laterals for distribution box systems shall be 100 feet; laterals shall be equal in length and spaced not less than eight feet apart, center to center. Absorption trenches shall be not more than 36 inches wide. 
                  (d)  Field layout methods for conventional septic tank systems. Absorption fields shall be planned and installed in accordance with one of the following methods: 
                  (1)  Distribution box method. On level or sloping topography, the distribution box method may be used, and shall be required when dosing tanks are used. A firm earthen or concrete foundation for distribution boxes extending at least 12 inches beyond the walls of the box shall be provided to ensure against tilting of the distribution box. Extreme care should be exercised in backfilling around and over the distribution box. The top of the distribution box shall have a minimum earth cover of six inches, but no more than 24 inches unless provisions are made for ready access to the distribution box. The sewer from the septic tank or dosing tank shall enter the distribution box and terminate inside the distribution box with an elbow turned downward to form a submerged outlet at normal water level, or a baffle may be used, providing the same function is accomplished. Absorption lines of equal lengths shall be connected to distribution box outlets by independent sewers. Absorption trenches may be installed at the same elevation or at different elevations, but all sewers leading from the distribution box outlet to the absorption lines shall be installed at the same elevation and shall be level for two feet and shall be sealed watertight. Beginning two feet from the distribution box, the grade of such sealed lines shall be not less than one-eighth-inch per foot. Absorption lines shall be laid on a uniform grade of not less than two inches nor more than four inches per 100 feet with the minimum of two inches recommended. An increased number of shorter trenches is recommended rather than the use of fewer, longer trenches. 
                  (2)  Level field method. On level or slightly sloping topography, the level field method may be used. When this method is used, the absorption field shall be installed level, with all absorption lines inter-connected to form a continuous system. A standard tee fitting shall be used to inter-connect the absorption lines. 
                  (3)  Serial distribution method. On more severely sloping topography, the serial distribution method may be used. When this method is used, level absorption trenches shall be constructed along land contours. The sewer from the septic tank shall enter the uppermost absorption lines and terminate at any point in the line so that all sewage from the septic tank is discharged into the first line. Adjacent absorption lines shall be successively connected by means of overflow sewers constructed at any point along the line in such a manner that each trench is filled with effluent to the full depth of aggregate before the effluent flows through the overflow sewer to the next trench. The invert of the first overflow sewer must be at least four inches lower than the invert of the septic tank outlet. At the point where an overflow sewer leaves an absorption trench, the excavation for the overflow sewer shall be dug no deeper than the top of the aggregate in the absorption trench, so that an undisturbed block of earth will remain in place for the full depth of the aggregate. Overflow sewers connecting absorption trenches shall be laid on undisturbed earth.

                  Sec. 32-26. - Privies. 
                  Privies shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the minimum design and construction criteria established by the current on-site sewage management system manual. 
                  (Res. No. 05081997, att. C(290-5-26-.08), 5-8-1997) 
                  Sec. 32-27. - Alternative and experimental on-site sewage management systems and site modifications. 
                  (a)  General information. 
                  (1)  The department recognizes that on-site sewage management systems employing solids retention and on-site soil absorption of sewage effluent, if designed properly and installed in suitable soil, are usually ecologically safe and do adequately protect the public health. 
                  (2)  The department further recognizes that substantial portions of the state's undeveloped land area are marginally suitable or totally unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, and that continued installation of such systems will have a detrimental effect on the public health. Where appropriate, and after thorough assessment of alternatives, the county board of health will consider alternative on-site sewage management systems and/or modifications for areas with soils which may have only marginal suitability in their present condition, including community-managed on-site sewage management systems and combinations of public or community sewage treatment systems and on-site sewage management systems. 
                  (3)  When considering proposals for alternative on-site sewage management systems, priority shall be given to those situations where the alternative system will resolve an existing sewage management problem. Any person or community desiring to install an alternative on-site sewage management system shall submit the following information to the county board of health: 
                  a.  Plans and specifications, along with any engineering, laboratory, or field data required. 
                  b.  Information as required on the application for an individual on-site sewage management system construction permit, and any additional information as may be required by the county board of health. If the proposal for the system is approved, the person making application will be informed by the county board of health of any requirements for maintenance, and any monitoring procedures deemed necessary by the county board of health. Reduction of water usage by the installation of water conserving fixtures and devices should be considered in overall strategy. 
                  (b)  Experimental on-site sewage management systems. The department may consider proposals for the use of experimental on-site sewage management systems. Acceptance or denial of such proposals shall depend on many site and system specific-factors, including a primary consideration that the remainder of the site is suitable for a conventional septic tank system in the event of failure of the experimental system. 
                  (c)  Site modifications. Approval of certain lots determined to be unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, may be reconsidered if appropriate site modifications are carried out to eliminate or significantly ameliorate unfavorable site characteristics. Modifications may include surface or subsurface drainage systems, filling, grading, etc. Any person desiring to modify a lot for the purpose of obtaining a construction permit for installation of an on-site sewage management system shall submit for approval, detailed plans showing the type and extent of modifications. The county board of health may require any additional information or clarification needed for formulating a proper decision on the proposed modifications. No modifications shall be carried out prior to the approval and issuance of a construction permit.

                  Sec. 32-28. - Percolation tests and test borings. 
                  (a)  Percolation tests. If conducted, percolation tests shall not be considered presumptive or conclusive evidence as to the suitability of a given lot for the use of on-site sewage management systems. Such tests shall be considered and analyzed as one of many criteria in determining soil suitability. Acceptable data on soil characteristics, including the location of rock strata and water table evaluations, will be considered of primary importance. Percolation tests, if conducted, will be used to augment or supplement the soils data. It should be further understood that percolation tests conducted during dry weather periods in areas that commonly experience high seasonal water table elevations during wet periods of the year will often exhibit very good percolation rates, thus inaccurately portraying the absorptive capacity of the soil during wet periods. Percolation tests shall be run in accordance with the modified Taft Engineering Center method published in the department's current manual for on-site sewage management systems. 
                  (b)  Location and number. 
                  (1)  Percolation test holes should be located in the area proposed for the installation of the absorption field. Data from test holes in areas outside of, or clearly uncharacteristic of, the proposed installation site will not be allowed. Percolation tests shall not be conducted in holes created by the deterioration of stumps and roots, or any other area which would render results that inaccurately portray the absorptive capacity of the soil in the absorption field area. 
                  (2)  The number of tests shall be sufficient to obtain a proper appraisal of the absorptive capacity of the soil in the proposed absorption field area and shall be determined by the county board of health. The number of tests required for preliminary appraisal of subdivisions may be specified in lesser numbers, provided a general overview of the soil characteristics of the total subdivision acreage is provided. Percolation test holes shall be located by number on a topographic map showing lot designation, boundaries, easements, etc., and the results shall be recorded on the map. 
                  (c)  Test borings for rock, shale, and hardpan. Where surface outcropping or subsurface formations raise reasonable doubt concerning the operational effectiveness of on-site sewage management systems, a sufficient number of test borings to an appropriate depth may be required by the county board of health to determine whether on-site sewage management systems can be expected to give satisfactory service. Such borings and the results shall be located by number and recorded on the topographic map. 
                  (d)  Individuals conducting tests. Individuals conducting percolation tests and/or test borings shall notify the county board of health at least 24 hours prior to performing these procedures and, at the option of the county board of health, such procedures shall be performed in the presence of a county board of health representative.

                  Sec. 32-29. - Septage removal and disposal. 
                  (a)  Septage removal permit. No person shall engage in the removal or disposal of the contents of septic tanks, pit privies, or other on-site sewage management or experimental systems without having first applied for and obtained from the county board of health a septage removal permit, renewed annually, for such activities. The application for such septage removal shall be submitted in writing on forms provided by the county board of health at least ten days prior to engaging in such activities. The application shall include, but not be limited to, the business name and address, name and address of the applicant, the manner by which such contents are to be removed, transported, and given final disposal and such other documentation as may be required by the county board of health, including evidence that septage removed and transported will be accepted at approved disposal sites. If surface spreading, subsurface land disposal or other method of treatment or disposal is to be used, additional information may be required. 
                  (b)  Disposal methods. Approved methods of disposal of septage from on-site sewage management systems shall be discharged to a public or community sewage treatment system for treatment in a wastewater treatment plant, treatment at separate septage handling facilities, or direct land application. Disposal by any of these methods shall require written permission from both the appropriate governing official, private septage handling facility owner or land owner and a representative of the county board of health. 
                  (c)  Vehicle identification. The name and address of the person or firm engaging in the removal of septage from on-site sewage management systems and the permit number shall be lettered on both sides of each vehicle used for septage removal purposes. Letters and numerals shall not be less than two inches in height and shall be readily visible. 
                  (d)  Vehicle maintenance. Every vehicle used for removal of septage from on-site sewage management systems shall be equipped with a watertight tank or body and properly maintained. Liquid wastes shall not be transported in open bodied vehicles. All pumps, hose lines, valves and fittings shall be maintained so as to prevent leakage.

                  Sec. 32-30. - Grease traps. 
                  (a)  Required. Grease traps shall be required for commercial or industrial establishments with on-site sewage management systems where it is determined by the county board of health that grease may be introduced into the system in quantities that may adversely affect the operation of the system. 
                  (b)  Specifications and design. Plans and specifications for grease traps shall be submitted to the county board of health for approval. Grease traps shall be designed to provide a liquid capacity of not less than 125 gallons. Effluent from grease traps shall be disposed of in a septic tank and not directly discharged to the absorption field. 
                  (c)  Construction. Grease traps shall be located, installed and constructed so that the temperature of the sewage will be reduced to permit congealing or separation of grease, and easy access for cleaning is provided.

                  Sec. 32-32. - Subdivision and mobile home parks. 
                  (a)  Plans required. No person may sell, offer for sale, lease, rent, begin construction or otherwise begin the physical development of a subdivision or mobile home park where public or community sewage treatment systems are not available or contemplated to be available to serve the proposed development until proposals and plans for the water supply and sewage disposal method to be provided or installed have been submitted to and written approval has been obtained from the county board of health. 
                  (b)  Predevelopment review advised. All developers considering subdivision or mobile home park development where public or community sewage treatment systems will not be available are strongly advised to seek a predevelopment review by the county board of health prior to purchasing property and/or making substantial monetary outlays for developmental improvements. Rejection or tentative approval may be obtained at this time by submitting the following information: 
                  (1)  A boundary plat including: 
                  a.  Vicinity map; 
                  b.  A topographic map; 
                  c.  A soil map and soil description. 
                  (2)  Complete subdivision analysis record on forms provided by the county board of health. 
                  (3)  Additional information as required by the county board of health for complete understanding and clarification. 
                  (c)  Proposals and plans. Unless previously provided, subdivision or mobile home park proposals shall be submitted on subdivision analysis forms provided by the county board of health. Subdivisions or mobile home park plans shall be drawn to a reasonable scale, with topography depicted by two-foot contour intervals; provided, however, that if ground slope is sufficiently steep for less frequent contour intervals to show the surface configurations, the county board of health may permit the use of lesser contour intervals. Plans shall illustrate the location of all present and proposed wells, watercourses, floodplains, water systems, sewage systems, roads, structures rights-of-way, and easements on the property and within 100 feet outside the perimeter of the property. Subdivision or mobile home park plans shall also include, stormwater drainage systems, elevations of seasonal high water table, location and results of test borings and percolation tests if applicable, lot identification, dimensions, and building lines. The name and registration number of the preparing surveyor or engineer shall also be on the subdivision or mobile home park plans. 
                  (d)  Soil evaluation. Data used to develop soil maps and descriptions shall be obtained from reliable sources as set forth in section 32-21(i), soil data acceptability. Where reliable soil information or the services of a soil scientist are not available, percolation tests, soil borings, and such other tests as the county board of health may require shall be conducted. 
                  (e)  Limits on use of on-site sewage management systems in subdivision and mobile home parks. Approval of subdivisions and mobile home parks for on-site sewage management systems shall not be granted when: 
                  (1)  An available sewer of a public or community sewage treatment system is within 500 feet of the subdivision or mobile home park. 
                  (2)  Soil maps, descriptions, and reports compiled by the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, or a soil scientist indicate that soil conditions prohibit safe development with on-site sewage management systems, or the average percolation rate for the subdivision or mobile home park is more than 90 minutes per inch. 
                  (f)  Drainage. Where on-site sewage management systems are proposed for use, an adequate surface water drainage system shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. Plans for drainage shall comply with local storm drainage plans and policies in effect in the city and/or county at the time of submission to the county board of health, and approval of drainage plans by the local governing body is a prerequisite to county board of health approval. Additionally, any changes or amendments to approved drainage plans must receive the concurrence of the governing agency, and the county board of health shall be provided with a written approval statement from the governing agency. In the absence of local drainage policies, the county board of health will evaluate drainage plans and render decisions on their acceptability. Plans for internal drainage (subsurface drainage), if used, shall be submitted to the county board of health for consideration as to their acceptability.

                  (a)  Certification requirements. 
                  (1)  After the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, no person shall perform the functions ascribed to an individual sewage system installer and service worker in the county unless he has received a valid certificate from the county board of health or unless he is under the direct supervision of an individual who has received a certificate. 
                  (2)  A certification shall be granted to an individual sewage system installer and service worker who displays an acceptable degree of competency on an examination which is compiled and administered by the board. Such examination shall contain questions suitable to the purpose of these rules and regulations and may be administered orally or in writing. The level of competency required on the examination shall be established by the board. 
                  (3)  Certificates shall not be transferable from one person to another. 
                  (4)  Request for examination shall be in writing. The examination shall be administered within 15 days of the date of the request; provided, however, in the event that the applicant is not successful on the examination, a 30-day waiting period shall be required prior to taking subsequent examinations. 
                  (5)  Certificates shall be valid for a period of three years, unless earlier suspended or revoked or until the board requires reexamination as prescribed in subsection (b)(3) of this section. 
                  (b)  Certification renewal and reexamination. 
                  (1)  An individual sewage system installer and service worker who holds a valid certificate may renew the certificate by making application in writing to the county board of health up to 60 days prior to the three-year expiration date of the certificate then held. 
                  (2)  An individual sewage system installer and service worker who holds an expired certificate shall be subject to reexamination by the board prior to reissuance of the certificate in the manner described in subsection (a) of this section. 
                  (3)  The board may require reexamination of all individual sewage system installers and service workers holding valid certificates, if in the opinion of the board it is justified due to significant changes in existing laws and rules and regulations. In such instance, the board will notify all certificate holders in writing, and provide a period of six months for reexamination. All certificates issued prior to reexamination as specified in this section shall be invalid at the end of the six-month period designated by the board. 
                  (c)  Denial of certificate. When a person has failed to display adequate knowledge and competency on the examination described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, the board shall give written notice of this fact to such person and afford an opportunity for a hearing as specified in section 2.01(a) of Enforcement and Administrative Rules and Procedure for the county. 
                  (d)  Intercounty acceptance of certified persons. The county board may accept proof of certification from other county boards of health, provided that their certification is granted on the same or a reasonably similar basis and that written proof of certification is provided by the originating county and signed by the chairman of the board of health or his authorized representative. In the event that the certificate from the originating county is expired, revoked or suspended, the board shall not be required to accept the certificate. 
                  (e)  Acceptance of certificates issued under prior rules and regulations. All valid certificates now held by individual sewage system installers and service workers, which were issued under the Rules and Regulations for Certification of Sewage Systems Installers, adopted by the county board of health on October 27, 1989, shall be considered valid until their expiration, revocation or suspension. 
                  (Ord. No. 061590SS, § 5, 6-15-1990) 
                  Sec. 32-62. - Enforcement. 
                  When in the judgment of the county board of health a certified individual sewage systems installer and service worker violates any provisions of the Rules and Regulations for Individual Sewage System Disposal Systems chapter 270-5-25 (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. ch. 270-5-25) of the state department of human resources or any subsequent rules and regulations or laws of the county board of health, state department of human resources, or the legislature of the state, which relate to the work performed by individual sewage system installers and service workers or otherwise displays negligence or incompetence, the certificate provided under section 32-61 may be revoked; provided, however, such persons shall be notified of the charges in writing and provided with an opportunity for a hearing as specified in section 2.01(a) of Enforcement and Administrative Rules and Practice and Procedure of the county prior to any such revocation.
