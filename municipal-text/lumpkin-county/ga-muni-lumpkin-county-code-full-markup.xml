PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Lumpkin County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were local legislative acts relative to the county and ordinances and resolutions adopted by the county board of commissioners through May 21, 2009. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments

Amendments to the act are indicated by history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a subsequent history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act.

Similarly, Part II of the act, providing for referendum, and enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

Any part of Lumpkin County which is described in that attachment as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Except as otherwise provided in the description of any commissioner district, whenever the description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia.

                  Sec. 13. - Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds of the authority shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Lumpkin County, Georgia, nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said county, but such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for.

                  Sec. 14. - Trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside the state. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of the revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition and construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys. 
                  Sec. 15. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the revenue bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes thereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
                  Sec. 16. - Sinking fund. 
                  The moneys received pursuant to an intergovernmental contract and the revenues, fees, tolls, fines, charges, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such revenues, fees, tolls, fines, charges, and earnings were produced by a particular project for which revenue bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or the trust indenture may provide. Such funds so pledged from whatever source received shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund, which sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of: 
                  (1)  The interest upon such revenue bonds as the same shall fall due; 
                  (2)  The principal or purchase price of such revenue bonds as the same shall fall due; 
                  (3)  Any premium upon such revenue bonds as the same shall fall due; 
                  (4)  The purchase of such revenue bonds in the open market; and 
                  (5)  The necessary charges of the paying agent for paying principal and interest. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. 
                  Sec. 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds or any of the coupons appertaining thereto and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights given in this Act may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the revenue bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state, including specifically but without limitation, the Revenue Bond Law, or granted under this Act or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, fines, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
                  Sec. 18. - Validation. 
                  Revenue bonds and the security therefor shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Bond Law. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the state and any institution, department, or other agency of the state and any county, municipality, school district, or other political subdivision or authority of the state which has contracted with the authority for services or facilities relating to the project for which revenue bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated. Such defendant shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts shall not be adjudicated as a part of the basis for the security for the payment of any such revenue bonds. The revenue bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such revenue bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority and all other defendants. 
                  Sec. 19. - Venue and jurisdiction. 
                  Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Lumpkin County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
                  Sec. 20. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
                  While any of the revenue bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such revenue bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or authority shall be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such revenue bonds nor shall the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such revenue bonds and, upon the issuance of such revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such revenue bonds. 
                  Sec. 21. - Moneys received considered trust funds. 
                  All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenue, income, fees, and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act. 
                  Sec. 22. - Purpose of the authority. 
                  Without limiting the generality of any provision of this Act, the general purpose of the authority is declared to be that of providing buildings, facilities, and services for the citizens in Lumpkin County, Georgia.

                  Sec. 24. - Rules, regulations, service policies, and procedures for operation of projects. 
                  It shall be the duty of the authority to prescribe rules, regulations, service policies, and procedures for the operation of any project or projects constructed or acquired under the provisions of this Act, including the basis upon which recreational services and facilities and other public services and facilities shall be furnished. The authority may adopt bylaws. 
                  Sec. 25. - Tort immunity. 
                  To the extent permitted by law, the authority shall have the same immunity and exemption from liability for torts and negligence as Lumpkin County, Georgia; and the officers, agents, and employees of the authority when in the performance of the work of the authority shall have the same immunity and exemption from liability for torts and negligence as the officers, agents, and employees of Lumpkin County, Georgia, when in the performance of their public duties or work of the county. 
                  Sec. 26. - Tax-exempt status of authority.

                  Sec. 5. - Revenue bonds. 
                  The authority, or any authority or body which has or which may in the future succeed to the powers, duties, and liabilities vested in the authority created hereby, shall have power and is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds of the authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost as herein defined of any one or more projects. The principal of and interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund hereby provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates per annum, payable at such time or times, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority, and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution for the issuance of bonds. 
                  Sec. 6. - Same; form, denomination; registration; place of payment. 
                  The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereon, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. 
                  Sec. 7. - Same; signatures; seal. 
                  In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary of the authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and the secretary of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such person may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. 
                  Sec. 8. - Same; negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
                  All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of this state. Such bonds, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation within the state. 
                  Sec. 9. - Same; sale; price; proceeds. 
                  The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority. The proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose or purposes provided in the resolutions and proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds. 
                  Sec. 10. - Same; interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
                  Prior to the preparation of any definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
                  Sec. 11. - Same; replacement of lost or mutilated bonds. 
                  The authority may provide for the replacement of any bonds or coupons which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
                  Sec. 12. - Same; conditions precedent to issuance. 
                  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified or required by this Act. In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
                  Sec. 13. - Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Lumpkin County nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said county; but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. All such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
                  Sec. 14. - Trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for the protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.

                  Editor's note— Printed herein are local acts of the Georgia General Assembly establishing and changing the county's geographical boundaries. In addition to the acts included in this article, 1874 Ga. Laws (Act No. CCCXXII), page 372, changed the boundary between Lumpkin County and neighboring Dawson County, Georgia; however, that act has been omitted since it was repealed and the then original boundaries restored by 1875 Ga. Laws (Act No. CCLVIII), page 274. In some instances herein, only the portion of the act regarding boundaries has been printed and the remainder of the act has been omitted, as indicated by editorial notes. The bracketed phrase "illegible text" appearing in some of the acts herein is derived from state historical records. In compiling these acts, obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. The acts printed herein gave rise to a boundary dispute between Lumpkin County and Dawson County, Georgia. A survey of the disputed boundary was ordered by the governor by executive order dated August 9, 2005. The survey was subsequently conducted and approved by the secretary of state on December 9, 2008.

                  (2)  To employ and remove all department heads of the county under the jurisdiction of the board of commissioners and staff employees of the county manager pursuant to policies established by the board, except for the county attorney, county auditor, and members of all the boards, commissions, and authorities who shall be appointed and removed by the board of commissioners pursuant to law or county ordinance; 
                  (3)  To exercise managerial authority and supervision over the county manager's staff and all department heads under the jurisdiction of the board of commissioners;

                  (6)  To recommend to the board of commissioners for adoption such measures as the county manager may deem necessary or expedient; 
                  (7)  To supervise the performance of all contracts made by any person, company, or corporation with the county for work done for the board of commissioners; 
                  (8)  To submit to the board of commissioners for approval, prior to July 31 of each year, a proposed operating budget for the next fiscal year showing budget revenues and expenditures during the preceding fiscal year; appropriations and estimated revenue and recommended expenditures for the next fiscal year; recommended tax levies; and such other information and data as may be considered necessary by the board of commissioners;

                  (11)  To delegate purely administrative duties to department heads or subordinates in the county government whose work the county manager shall supervise and direct; provided, however, that the delegation or assignment of duties to subordinates shall not relieve the county manager from responsibility for administration of such position; 
                  (12)  To appoint and employ the clerk of the board of commissioners of the county and to assign such additional duties of such position as the county manager deems appropriate;

                  Sec. 2-178. - Procedure for employing outside legal counsel. 
                  Having determined that there exists no formal policy for selecting and engaging outside legal counsel to represent the county, its constitutional officers, agents and employees, the board of commissioners finds as follows: 
                  (1)  In all legal matters it shall be a primary responsibility of all personnel to protect the attorney-client privilege. No legal matters shall be discussed by the board except in a properly called executive session. Each board member, agent and employee shall ensure that legal matters are protected from inadvertent disclosure by email or otherwise. 
                  (2)  The county attorney shall have the primary responsibility for representing the county. Within the general representation of the county, the board of commissioners shall be the primary client of the county attorney, and all conflict issues shall be so resolved. 
                  (3)  It is recognized that the county attorney will, from time to time, determine that outside counsel is required to properly represent the county due to the special nature of the matter under consideration, the size of the task, conflicts, and time constraints and for other reasons. 
                  (4)  When the legal matter in question is covered by any insurance policy such that the insurer appoints counsel, the appointed counsel will be the primary counsel for the county in that matter. The board of commissioners, however, reserve the right to engage additional counsel as they may direct. 
                  (5)  When time allows, the county attorney, county manager and finance director, with initial guidance from the board of commissioners, shall issue a request for qualification or a request for proposal to selected qualified counsel. Responders shall be interviewed or otherwise reduced to no more than three recommended applicants with the final choice made by the board of commissioners. This will be the anticipated selection process for bond attorneys. 
                  (6)  The board may, from time to time, direct that a request for quotation (RFQ) be issued for various types of legal matters for the purpose of preparing a "recommended list" of attorneys for such matters as the board deems appropriate. 
                  (7)  When any legal matter involves litigation or a threat of litigation, a timely response may require coordination with potential outside counsel, and the rendering of opinions. The county attorney shall coordinate all such matters with the county manager, and will provide periodic notice to the board. Such notice may be by email of information to be reviewed at the county manager's office when necessary to protect the attorney-client privilege. When matters are of lower sensitivity (notice of filed documents, ante litem notice and other public documents) copies will normally be disseminated to all board members. 
                  (8)  All engagement of outside counsel will be reviewed at a called meeting or at the next regular meeting of the board in executive session. The board will approve at that time the engagement of counsel or will direct alternative engagement of counsel, subject to any cost of work done by engaged counsel.

                  (a)  In the event a decision of any department of the county is appealed to the board of commissioners for review, the administrative procedures set out in these procedures shall provide guidance on how such an appeal shall be conducted. 
                  (b)  To the extent that the documentation of the department from which the appeal arises has specific guidance for the filing and conduct of an appeal, those instructions will be followed unless otherwise specifically provided. In any case where the time provided for in the specific guidance is greater or lesser than the time provided herein, the greater time will prevail.

                  2.  An entity without legal status (for example, an informal business or an individual "doing business as" a "business name") must be filed in the name of the individual. 
                  3.  No other person may sign for a person or entity filing an appeal unless the person signing is duly authorized in writing to represent the person or entity during the appeal. Any, each and every act by such authorized person shall be binding on the person or entity represented. If, in the sole discretion of the county manager it is determined that the agent or representative should be a designated "attorney in fact" acting under a written power of attorney, the county manager shall provide an appropriate form, the proper execution of which shall become a necessary part of the appeal. 
                  b.  No appeal shall be accepted unless all fees due and payable have been paid. 
                  c.  Each appeal shall be filed in ten copies, with each copy a compete set of all documents and exhibits to be considered.

Any appeal which does not provide ten copies of each document, and each exhibit, photographs, books or other attachment, shall be refused. Any material added to the appeal after filing must also be provided in ten copies as set out below. No material shall be permitted to be entered during the appeal unless the specified copies have been provided in advance as required. 
                  (2)  Within ten days following the date when the complete appeal has been filed, with all documents and exhibits in proper numbers of copies, the appeal shall be sent to the county manager for review. The department shall include with the appeal all background information, exhibits, and the decision of the department in ten copies. 
                  (3)  Within ten days of receiving an appeal, the county manager shall either return the appeal to the department if any element of the appeal is not provided as set out in these procedures, or forward the appeal to the members of the board of commissioners for consideration. The county manager shall at that time poll the board members to determine a time and date certain at which the appeal shall be heard. 
                  (4)  Within five days of providing the appeal to the members of the board, the county manager will set the time and date of the appeal, and will give notice to the department, the appellant, all members of the board of commissioners, and such additional parties at the county manager deems appropriate. 
                  (5)  Appeals shall be set normally on a date and at a time not in conflict with other county business, and shall be the sole activity on the agenda; multiple appeals may be scheduled consecutively if required. 
                  a.  Appeals, which have been set for a date and time, may be reset at the sole discretion of the county manager if required by the exigencies of the governing authority. 
                  b.  An appellant may request in writing, stating the basis for the request, that a scheduled appeal be reset. Granting such request shall be in the sole discretion of the county manager, and shall only be granted for good cause shown. 
                  (6)  An appeal may be amended or supplemented by the Appellant at any time prior to the hearing date. 
                  a.  For any appeal or amendment the county manager, in his sole discretion, may reset the date of the hearing to provide adequate time for review of the amendment or the supplemental information. 
                  b.  Any amendment or supplementation within ten or fewer days of the scheduled appeal shall automatically require that the hearing date be reset to a date more than ten days in the future. 
                  c.  Any amendment or supplement, and all exhibits or additional material or information filed therewith, shall be filed in ten copies. 
                  (7)  Upon the call of the appeal by the presiding officer of the board, appellant shall have 30 minutes to present the appeal. Members of the board shall ask questions as they deem appropriate. At the end of 30 minutes, appellant will cease speaking. The department from which the appeal arose shall have 15 minutes to present its rebuttal. At the end of 15 minutes the department will cease speaking. 
                  (8)  After both appellant and the department have been heard, the presiding officer shall call for a motion to approve the appeal, to deny the appeal, or to request additional information. In circumstances requiring additional consideration, the board may also move for additional consideration and set a date and time certain to reconvene to consider the matter and render a decision. 
                  (9)  When sitting for the purpose of considering an appeal, no appeal shall be heard unless at least three members are present at all times during the appeal hearing and decision. All members hearing an appeal must be present for the consideration of the motion on the appeal. Members not present at all times during the appeal may not vote on the motion on the appeal. 
                  (10)  Any decision upon motion to deny the appeal shall be final. 
                  a.  No decision to deny an appeal shall be subject to reconsideration by the board except by unanimous vote of the board of commissioners for the sole purpose of preventing manifest injustice. 
                  b.  In the event a denial is reconsidered, the board may affirm its denial, or structure such solution, as it deems appropriate. Its decision on the matter shall be final and not subject to further review.

                  Sec. 2-508. - Lumpkin County facility naming policy. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners, recognizing that some public facilities house programs that are dependent, in part, on private funding, encourages those programs to seek the support of friends, corporations, and other private individuals and organizations and does hereby set a policy regarding the naming of facilities and/or rooms. 
                  (b)  General. Funds raised from private donations may be used in support of the mission and objectives of the program, including funds for the construction of physical facilities, and gifts and grants for other purposes as may be designated by the donor. However, programs are not authorized to commit any county funds for challenge or matching grants or gifts for the construction of facilities or for other purposes. The board of commissioners shall not consider gifts, contributions, or income in determining the allocation of county funds to that program. Private donations shall not be subject to control by the board of commissioners or the county administration except as otherwise provided in board policy or by the Memoranda of Understanding established between a program and the county. A program may not accept gifts of real property without the prior approval of the board of commissioners. A program may otherwise accept gifts, bequests, agreements, or declarations of trust that do not carry obligations to the county that may conflict with state law and that do not impose a financial burden on the program beyond that which can be managed within the program's current budget. If acceptance of the gift or donation would require the program to incur additional cost that cannot be borne within the program's current resources, the program must obtain the approval of the board of commissioners before accepting the gift or donation. Each program must maintain a report of all gifts received by the program and its cooperative organizations through private donations and shall provide an annual report of such gifts to the board of commissioners. Each program is authorized to execute those documents necessary to provide proper fiscal management of those funds accepted under this authorization and to further delegate the authority to execute such documents to the chief financial officer of the program. 
                  (c)  Introduction. The act of naming a facility is the conferral of not only a high honor but also a conspicuous honor. It publicly exhibits the judgment and standards of the county as well as the board of commissioners and signifies lasting approval of the actions of the honoree. 
                  The board of commissioners considers the naming of county real estate and facilities in honor of an individual, family, corporation, foundation, or organization to be one of the highest distinctions it can bestow. Namings may be authorized for a person who has attained prominence generally recognized throughout the county, for outstanding and distinguished accomplishments, for service, or for philanthropic giving. In light of the importance and magnitude of this honor, the following guidelines and process shall apply to all place naming on all property owned or leased by the county under the auspices of a county program. 
                  The board of commissioners may establish an (ad hoc or standing) advisory committee to make naming recommendations to the board. The chairman of the advisory committee is the final arbiter of all decisions related to place naming prior to submittal to the board of commissioners for approval in accordance with board policy and procedures. 
                  (d)  Process for place naming. When the desire for naming is apparent and/or it appears that a contribution (gift) to benefit the program will result in a naming request for a donor or other individual, the county manager must be notified and provided with a profile of the donor or individual being honored, the area of interest along with any proposed stipulations, and information about how the contribution (gift) will be paid. The program seeking donations in exchange for naming rights should ensure that the proposed naming is consistent with the interest of the board of commissioners and is commensurate with the level of prominence, accomplishment, service or philanthropic giving from the person, persons, group, or groups for which the naming will be made. Namings authorized without associated fund raising should be the exception. The board of commissioners will authorize external namings to honor a living person only when that person has been disassociated from employment from local, state, or federal government employment for at least two years prior to seeking the board of commissioner's approval. 
                  After review by the county manager, the information will be forwarded to the chairman for his consideration. If approved, the chairman will submit the naming recommendation to the board of commissioners for approval in accordance with board policy and procedures. All naming of facilities, rooms, real estate, facilities, and property owned or leased by the board of commissioners, including facilities constructed, donated, or acquired by affiliated organizations of the county, requires prior authorization by the board of commissioners. 
                  In order to assure county and program coordination of naming ceremonies, such events typically are planned through the county manager's office in coordination with the associated program office(s). 
                  (e)  Signage. All signage to be affixed on or adjacent to any, building, facility, or interior space shall be approved by the board of commissioners (in consultation with the donor). All signage shall be consistent with the county's master plan and design criteria. No signage shall be approved and/ or erected that is in contravention of board of commissioner's policy. All signage must be ADA compliant. 
                  (f)  Contribution guidelines. When the naming of a facility is based on a monetary contribution, the following guidelines apply: 
                  (1)  Building: Any person or entity desirous of having a building named shall be able to pursue this end in consideration of a financial contribution so long as the gift amount is at least ten percent of the cost to construct the building or of the estimated value for existing buildings. The gift must be secured at least four months prior to the announcement of the naming and may only occur in accordance with the approval of the board of commissioners. 
                  (2)  Interior: Any person or entity desirous of having an interior space such as rooms, hallways, etc., named shall be able to pursue this end in consideration of a financial contribution of at least $10,000.00 or $50,00 per square foot whichever is greater. The gift must be secured at least four months prior to the announcement of the naming and may only occur with the approval of the board. 
                  At the discretion of the board, there may be reasonable exceptions to the above. 
                  The gift, or a signed pledge for the gift, must have been received by the institution before the naming is completed. Deferred or estate gifts are preferred to be irrevocable and defined in writing. Deferred gifts such as bequests, charitable gift annuities, charitable trusts, and life insurance policies may be appropriate for current naming opportunities. Options should be discussed with donors and appropriate assurances secured by the program. 
                  Any gift, for a place naming shall be paid over a period of no longer than five years and outlined in writing in a commitment signed by the donor. All other gifts for interiors must be paid in full once approved by the board of commissioners. The gift may be unrestricted or to establish a program endowment or in other ways selected by the donor and is not intended to be restricted to construction and/or facilities related costs. 
                  It is the policy of Lumpkin County to forward the formal naming request to the board of commissioners only after at least 20 percent of the gift has been received by the program. Should the request be denied, funds will be returned to the donor. The board of commissioners may also consider in-kind contributions to a project in exchange for naming rights to facilities or rooms. 
                  (g)  Removal or modification of names. Namings authorized by the board of commissioners shall not be modified without approval of the board. 
                  From time to time, situations may occur which would warrant the removal of a name from a building or room in a facility. When the naming authority lies with the board of commissioners, so does the authority and responsibility to remove a name when appropriate. 
                  Circumstances may dictate that the parameters under which a place name was bestowed at the program have changed to the extent that consideration must be given to removing the name. These circumstances may include, but are not limited to the following circumstances: 
                  The honoree does not follow through on a financial commitment; The honoree fails to maintain the high standards of the county or program or the board of commissioners; or 
                  The honoree, person or entity, engages in conduct that constitutes an act of moral turpitude; or for other appropriate reasons. 
                  The board of commissioners judges each naming removal situation individually based on the facts. No decision will be made without taking into account all of the facts that are relevant to the decision. The board will endeavor to ensure that the removal of a name is consistent with the interests of county, board of commissioners, and the program. 
                  The Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners makes no assurances that a naming will remain beyond the useful life of the facility or in perpetuity. If a facility or feature is substantially changed, a named facility or feature may no longer exist and the program director, in his or her discretion, may seek the board of commissioner's approval to transfer the name to a new facility or feature. 
                  (h)  Procedures for the removal of names. When it becomes apparent that there may be a reason to consider the removal of a name from a facility, the county manager shall be supplied with the original naming history and all salient circumstances surrounding the removal recommendation. 
                  The county manager will present the naming history to the board of commissioners who shall make a determination as to whether a name shall be removed. 
                  The removal of a name from a room or other interior space(s) of a facility must be approved by the board of commissioners. 
                  (i)  Periodic review of naming policy. The county manager shall review this guideline on a regular and recurring schedule in order to assure that it continues to be in compliance with the policies of the board of commissioners.

                  The purpose of this policy is to clearly define assets and real property, purchased or held, by Lumpkin County Government and the proper procedures for the inventory and disposal of such assets.

                  Sec. 2-564. - Definitions. 
                  (1)  Asset. Any item purchased by the county that has an initial, individual cost over $5,000.00 and a useful life of over two years, a serial number, or any item or group of items that is tracked on the county's general ledger as an asset. 
                  (2)  Real property. Any real estate and improvements on such property.

                  Sec. 2-565. - General objectives. 
                  An asset is defined as any item purchased, or held, by Lumpkin County Government that has an initial, individual cost over $5,000.00 and an estimated useful life in excess of two years. Such assets will be placed on the asset inventory maintained by the office of financial administration. Exceptions to this are vehicles and equipment purchased at State Surplus sales that are required to have a tag or have a useful life over two years or book value over $5,000.00. Such items will be placed on the asset listing even if the item's cost was less than $5,000.00. Donated capital assets are to be recorded at their estimated fair market value at the date of donation. 
                  This policy does not apply to "groups" of computers or office furniture purchased that may go over the $5,000.00 limit but individually be less than $5,000.00 unless placing them on the asset listing is beneficial to the county for insurance or depreciation purposes. 
                  Assets of the county shall be counted through a physical inventory annually in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 50-16-140 and 50-16-141 and a record of that inventory turned in to the office of financial administration for audit purposes. 
                  This policy also applies to all serial numbered items such as firearms, radios, pagers, phones, medical equipment, fire hose, gravel, pipe etc. even though these items may individually be less than the fixed asset threshold such items should be accounted for yearly, and while not maintained on the county asset inventory, each department is required to maintain a listing of these items, perform an annual county inventory, and name the person responsible for each item. 
                  Real property that is purchased, or held, by the county shall be reviewed annually for insurance purposes and to make sure the property is still useful to the county.

                  Sec. 2-566. - Disposal of assets. 
                  Assets shall be disposed of once they are no longer of value to the county in accordance with state and local law. Prior to disposal, a listing of all items shall be given to the county manager and division director of finance and special services for review and recommendation for removal from the asset inventory. The list will also be shared with other county departments to determine if an item can be used by another department prior to being placed on a work session agenda. Once the list is finalized, it will be taken before the board of commissioners for final review and a vote taken to dispose of the assets. The disposal of assets shall be handled via a public auction, or if the board of commissioners deems the items to be surplus and of no value, then those items may be disposed via transportation to the Lumpkin County transfer station, with a list of such property dumped returned to finance for inclusion in the annual inventory file, or sold for scrap. If items are sold for scrap, a listing of the items shall accompany the check when it is delivered to finance. 
                  The board of commissioners utilizes GovDeals for the disposal of assets. 
                  County assets under the $5,000.00 threshold, and not covered by this policy, shall be kept in storage until such time a county auction may be advertised and held. 
                  The board may also consider trading vehicles or equipment in with the value applied to the purchase/lease of new vehicles or equipment. Such action shall be spread upon the minutes of the meeting of the board of commissioners.

                  Disposition of real property owned by the county shall be conducted by public sale in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-9-3, or as otherwise provided by state law. 
                  Except as otherwise specifically provided by state law, the county shall not dispose of any real property unless the board of commissioners has declared such real property to be surplus. 
                  Real property may be sold by any means deemed most advantageous to the county under the particular circumstances, as determined by the board of commissioners. A sale to a private person shall be for highest net purchase price reasonably obtainable by the county. A sale to another unit of government shall be a fair and reasonable purchase price, which need not be as high as the purchase price obtainable from a private person.

                  Sec. 2-656. - Grant revenue recognition policy. 
                  All grant-related revenue entitled and transferred to the Lumpkin County BOC (and, in effect, the finance department) is recognized at the end of the respective grant's reporting period (by quarter, by month, etc.). These reporting periods are based on the multiple and specific conditions of the grant, or by some other authoritative reporting guidelines. 
                  In the event that a grant reimbursement is not received by March 31st of the following fiscal year, the reimbursement request will be considered "deferred revenue" for the just-ended fiscal year, and the reimbursement revenue will be recognized when it is received.

                  Policy: For all manual journal entries created by any one member of the finance department's staff (excluding the finance director), each journal entry is verified by the finance director before being submitted into the accounting software. For all manual journal entries created by the finance director, the grant/budget specialist verifies each journal entry before submission.

                  Sec. 2-658. - Lumpkin County inter-fund transfer policy. 
                  Interfund transfers are accounting transactions which move fund balance (reserves) from one fund to another. Such transfers are used to 1) move revenues from the fund that the statute or budget requires to collect them to the fund that the statute or budget requires to expend them, and 2) provide unrestricted revenues collected in the general fund (Lumpkin County's primary operating account) to finance various programs accounted for in other funds in accordance with budgetary authorizations. The director of finance as well as the budget/grant analyst possess the designated authority to analyze, prepare, and execute routine/non-routine transfers in the normal course of business. All transfers are allowable under GAAP principles. Generally, any interfund transfer can be categorized into one of two types: 
                  (1)  Residual equity transfers: nonrecurring or non-routine transfers of equity between funds; such equity may or may not be returned by the recipient fund. 
                  (2)  Operating transfers: routine transfers for which there is no intent to return any of the transferred funds to the lending fund. 
                  With the exception of Capital Road Fund transfers to the SPLOST Fund, all inter-fund transfers that occur within the course of business for Lumpkin County are linked directly to the county's general fund; reserves are either a) transferred from the general fund to a recipient fund or b) transferred to the general fund from another fund. Further, these transfers are readily labeled in one of three ways: transfers (expenses to GF), "Due To" transfers (assets/liabilities of GF), and "Due From" transfers (assets/liabilities of GF). Listed below is the breakdown of Lumpkin County's interfund transfers based on said categorization. 
                  Transfers (from GF) to: 
                  • E-911 (for portion of expenses not covered by revenue). 
                  • Multiple grants (to match grant amounts). 
                  • Public defender (county contribution). 
                  • Capital projects (construction projects/capital purchases). 
                  • Solid waste fund. 
                  "Due To" Transfers: 
                  • GF to drug rehabilitation fund (for cash held at year end). 
                  • GF to law library fund (for cash held at year end). 
                  • GF to technology fee fund [probate and magistrate] (for cash held at year end). 
                  • SPLOST fund to GF (for expenditures paid). 
                  • CDBG fund to GF (for health dept. grant expenses). 
                  • Planning fund to GF (for expenditures). 
                  • Hotel/motel tax fund to GF (for funds paid to Chamber of Commerce). 
                  • Public defender to GF (expenditures). 
                  "Due From" Transfers: 
                  • Juvenile services fund to GF (for cash held at year end). 
                  • Other funds to GF (repayment for inmate fund purchases on credit card). 
                  • GF to multiple grants fund (repayment for expenses).

                  Sec. 2-659. - Lumpkin County electronic check signature policy. 
                  Payroll and accounts payable check distribution: As part of the check distribution process, the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners (in conjunction with the Lumpkin County Finance Department) uses electronic, template-based signatures for all payroll and accounts payable checks. The authorized signatures, explicitly reserved for and designated to the commission chairman, county manager, finance director, and county clerk, are applied (either individually or in some combination thereof) by default to all aforementioned checks during the printing process. All accounts payable checks require two authorized signatures and are generally supplied with the signatures of the county manager and finance director. Payroll checks are supplied with the chairman's signature, which is all that is required. It should be noted that any of the aforementioned signees have authorization to apply their electronic signatures to any type of check, if necessary; however, the county clerk's signature is never sufficient by itself, and must be accompanied by at least one other authorized signature. Without exception, all respective check register or check proof forms are signed by at least two of the aforementioned authorized signees prior to check disbursement. Lumpkin County also utilizes electronic payments for vendor invoices. The check proof of invoices to be paid requires two authorized signatures, most often the county manager, county clerk, or finance director prior to the file being submitted to the bank for processing. The file must also be approved by the finance director or the budget and grants analyst prior to final processing by the bank. 
                  Public defender check distribution: All checks originating and distributed from the public defender fund are also supplied with electronic, template-based signatures; again, only the Chairman, FD, CM, and CC are to be considered authorized signees. Only one authorized signature is needed to validate a PD check, and, generally, the FD's signature is used; however, any of the aforementioned personnel's signatures can be used if the FD is unavailable. Also, only one signature is necessary for a PD check register or check proof, and any one of the four authorized signatures can be used for check/check register verification. Lumpkin County also utilizes electronic payments for vendor invoices. The check proof of invoices to be paid requires one authorized signature, most often the finance director, prior to the file being submitted to the bank for processing. The file must also be approved by the finance director or the budget/grants analyst prior to final processing by the bank. 
                  SPLOST check distribution: All checks originating and distributed from the SPLOST fund are also supplied with electronic, template-based signatures; again, only the Chairman, FD, CM, and CC are to be considered as authorized signees. Two authorized signatures are needed to validate a SF check, and, generally, the FD and CM supply the respective checks with their signatures; however, any of the aforementioned personnel's signatures can be used if either the FD or CM is unavailable. Also, two signatures are necessary for a SF check register or check proof, and any one of the four authorized signatures can be used for check/check register verification. Lumpkin County also utilizes electronic payments for vendor invoices. The check proof of invoices to be paid requires one authorized signature, most often the finance director, prior to the file being submitted to the bank for processing. The file must also be approved by the finance director or the budget/grants analyst prior to final processing by the bank. 
                  (Res. No. 2012-69, exh. A, 12-18-2012; Res. No. 2017-64, Exh. A, 9-19-2017) 
                  Sec. 2-660. - Lumpkin County check distribution policy. 
                  Brief procedural background: With respect to the operational regulations of the Lumpkin County Finance Department, the accounts payable clerk (APC) is solely authorized to prepare for distribution (or, for "pick-up") any and all checks relating to/affecting the general fund, SPLOST fund, and some drug court related funds. Once a check has been printed by the APC, at least two designated county department heads and/or officials (typically the county manager, finance director, county clerk, or some combination thereof) must 1) verify the elements of the check and 2) add their signature of approval before sending the check to the accounting clerk (AC) for distribution. Once submitted to the AC, the check is sealed in an envelope and held securely for its intended recipient. 
                  Policy: After the AC has received the printed and verified check, he/she sends an email notification to its intended recipient. Some checks are produced on a weekly/bi-weekly/monthly basis and may or may not require email notification. Typically, most checks prepared for pick-up are entitled to county employees, but there are some vendors that request pick-up. Unless otherwise noted or excepted, all completed and available checks are to be distributed exclusively to department heads and/or authorized personnel from the company vendor; this measure should substantially diminish the possibility of any kind of confusion in relation to procedure as well as fraudulent incidents, thereby decreasing the county's (and the respective department's/vendor's) overall liability. At the discretion of the FD and AC, some checks can be distributed to county employees who do not manage their respective departments. Lastly, the employee/designated department official/vendor representative picking up the check must sign the accompanying check stub before leaving. This measure will further ensure quality control when said stubs (and all supplemental/remaining documentation relating to the checks) are digitally scanned into DocuScan. 
                  The AC keeps all distributable checks in a single folder that is secured in the safe. Again, unless otherwise excepted, department heads are exclusively permitted to pick-up any check respective to their branch. If/when, hypothetically, a check is being requested and the AC is unavailable to distribute, any one finance department employee has authorization to distribute the requested check as long as he/she verifies that the check sufficiently matches the recipient's request and information. 
                  Every effort will be made to have all checks available for pick-up every Friday after 2:00 p.m. In the event that a nationally or locally recognized holiday falls on any given Friday, or if an extended holiday (Thanksgiving, Christmas) should take up the majority of a given work week (especially the end of the week), checks will either be a) available for pick-up before the holiday begins or b) available in the upcoming week after the holiday, depending on the given workload for the department.

                  Sec. 2-661. - Lumpkin County money safe policy. 
                  Any department serving under the authority of the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners that receives, handles, stores, or deposits monies shall be required to use a security safe (with a lock and/or combination, preferably/specifically designed to protect money) for the purposes of housing and securing all said monies. Regardless of the department's protocol procedures for managing monies, all monies receipted in a given business day are to be securely stored in a safe at the close of that business day as a way of ensuring the monies' location. The safe should be stored within the department's designated building in an inconspicuous location, preferably in a lockable closet or underneath a desk. With the exception of authorized employees, this location should be inaccessible to all persons. All doors and rooms surrounding the safe are to be locked at the close of every business day.

                  From time to time it may be necessary for commissioners to request the purchase of certain supplies and materials to aid them in the performance of their duties. A request for such supplies and materials shall be submitted to the county clerk via email. The county clerk will verify that funds are available to purchase supplies and materials and will forward the request to the purchasing agent with the proper account code for processing. Should a commissioner request items that are not included in the current budget, that commissioner may request that the item(s) be added to the next work session agenda for consideration by the board of commissioners. Should the board of commissioners approve the request at the next regular meeting, the request will be forwarded to the purchasing agent with the appropriate account code for processing. This does not apply to items which are replaced according to adopted and or contractual replacement schedules.

                  Sec. 2-704. - Purchasing responsibilities. 
                  It is imperative that the county continually strives to balance cost, delivery, and quality in every area of the county's operations. It is mandatory in purchasing that the responsibility for buying materials and services be assigned to a group of people skilled in negotiating, value analysis, and other purchasing techniques. 
                  To achieve this overall objective, the responsibilities, authorities, and controls set forth in this procedure and related policies must be adhered to by all county employees and elected officials. 
                  The following are the basic responsibilities of the purchasing department: 
                  (1)  Only those persons to whom authority has specifically been delegated by the board of commissioners are authorized to commit county funds for materials, equipment, supplies, and services. 
                  (2)  The purchasing agent has the responsibility for the procurement of all goods and services and to either provide the services for such procurement or give functional directions to others delegated the authority to perform such service. 
                  (3)  Purchasing is responsible for initiating and maintaining effective and professional relationships with suppliers. 
                  (4)  All employees involved in purchasing activities will work to maintain and enhance the county's image by their personal conduct and methods of doing business. 
                  (5)  All employees engaged in purchasing activities will recognize and practice good public relations by giving all callers and visitors courteous treatment. 
                  (6)  Purchasing personnel are to seek to obtain and purchase all goods at the lowest possible total end-user cost, considering the guidelines of prices, service, quality, and delivery. 
                  (7)  Purchasing personnel are to inform ordering departments whenever the quality or specifications of materials ordered are inconsistent with sound purchasing practices or market conditions. 
                  (8)  Purchasing personnel will negotiate the return of rejected equipment or supplies to suppliers.

                  Sec. 2-705. - Purchasing requiring formal sealed bids. 
                  Approvals shall be in accordance with process described below. If the request is for public works projects or any other item that has been determined should be advertised, the request will be submitted to purchasing no later than 12:00 noon on Wednesday for submittal to the newspaper by 12:00 noon on Friday. The advertisement will be developed in accordance with Georgia Law and submitted by the purchasing agent. A bid package will be developed by purchasing in conjunction with public works, as needed, and can be picked up by interested parties. Once an approval form is received, the purchasing staff will use the following process: 
                  Competitive sealed bidding. In most cases, the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of source selection and should be used whenever possible, as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions must be met: 
                  (1)  Clear and adequate specifications are available; 
                  (2)  Two or more responsible bidders are willing to participate in the process; and 
                  (3)  Cost of materials, supplies, equipment or project is $20,000.00 or greater. 
                  Acquisitions $20,000.00 or more—Any commodity which is expected to cost $20,000.00 or more shall be acquired through the competitive sealed bid process except as otherwise provided in the procedure. 
                  Dissemination of invitations to bid. Public notice of an invitation to bid shall be advertised as required by Georgia Law. The public notice shall contain a general description of the item to be purchased, the location where documents may be obtained, and the date, time, and place of bid opening. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be in the purchasing office. Any other methods of advertisement, identified as likely to result in optimal competition, may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing agent. 
                  Receipt of bids. No bids shall be eligible for consideration by the county unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and received by the purchasing department by the date and time specified in the request for bids. The purchasing department shall stamp all bids with the date and time of receipt, and shall be secured until the designated opening time. A bid delivered late shall, under no circumstances, be eligible for consideration by the county. Late bids shall be returned unopened to the bidder. 
                  Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the request for bids. The name of each bidder, the purchase price contained in each bid, and such other information as the purchasing agent deems appropriate, shall be announced as the bids are opened. A record of bid information shall be recorded and available for public inspection. Prior to the opening of bids, only the number and not the names of bidders may be disclosed to interested parties. 
                  Modification of bids. Any clerical mistake which is blatantly obvious on the face of a bid may, subject to the limitations described below, be corrected upon written request and verification submitted by the bidder. A non-material omission in a bid may be corrected if the purchasing agent determines the correction to be in the county's best interests. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening: 
                  (1)  Price information, and 
                  (2)  Any required insurance or bonding. 
                  Withdrawal of bids. Bids may be withdrawn, only by written request, at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, withdrawal of bid shall be based upon the following: 
                  The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid due to an error, within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure. Bids may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids solely due to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents, and material used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. The bidder's original work papers shall be the whole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if he elects to withdraw his bid. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid. 
                  Bid evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the solicitation. 
                  Bid cancellation. An invitation for bids may be cancelled prior to opening date or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the county, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing department, or as a result of improper conduct on the part of a county employee. The reason for any cancellation shall be made a part of the bid file. 
                  Bid award—Responsive and responsible bidder(s). Subject to approval by the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners, bids shall be awarded to the responsible bidder(s) whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bid, will be most advantageous to the county, with price and other factors considered. A written award mailed (or otherwise furnished) to the successful bidder within the time for acceptance specified in the bid shall be deemed to result in a binding contract without further action by either party. 
                  Approval of bids. All bid awards shall be approved or rejected by the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners. 
                  Rejection of bids. Lumpkin County reserves the right to reject any or all bids if it determines such rejection to be in the best interest of the county. 
                  Disqualification of bids. The following types of bids shall be disqualified for consideration for a bid award: 
                  (1)  A bid which is incomplete in any material aspect, 
                  (2)  A bid submitted without required bonds or insurance; 
                  (3)  A bid submitted by a company on the ineligible source list. 
                  Tie bids. In the event two responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the two are substantially the same, the bid shall be awarded to the Lumpkin County bidder if only one of the bidders has its principal place of business in Lumpkin County. If both or neither of the tied bidders has its principal place of business in Lumpkin County, the bid award shall be made to the winner of a coin toss by purchasing department staff in a public session, where bidders and one or more witnesses may be present. Lumpkin County reserves the right to award a bid to an out of county business should the successful bidder be delinquent on taxes payable to Lumpkin County.

Any bid or proposal submitted without the required bid bond will not be considered for award. 
                  (1)  Bid bond : The bond must be accompanied by a bid guarantee of not less than five percent of the amount of the bid. The guarantee may in the form of cashier's check or certified check made payable to the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners, or a bid bond issued by a surety company.

                  (3)  Payment bond. The successful bidder may be required to furnish a guarantee of payment for the protection of all subcontractors and all persons supplying labor, material, machinery, and equipment provided for in the contract, in the amount of the contract awarded, prior to commencing work. This bond is required for road projects only if the contract is more than $20,000.00; all other projects require a payment bond regardless of the contract amount.

                  Sec. 2-707. - Collusive or anti-competitive practices. 
                  All bid packages shall contain a non-collusion affidavit to be signed and notarized prior to award.

                  "Professional services" refers to such services as legal, medical, engineering, surveying, architectural, accounting, finance, and others performed by individuals whose profession is licensed by the state or federal government. 
                  It is the policy of this county to award contracts for professional services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications at a fair and reasonable price, with the ultimate selection based on the best interest of the county and receipt of maximum value. This is a "Quality Based Selection" process. 
                  Unless specifically authorized by the board of commissioners, the selection process for professional services shall follow the same basis process as that for competitive sealed bids. The invitation will be for request for proposal, and pricing will not always be requested at the invitation level. The scope of work will include the selection criteria to be used. When the selection process for professional services is executed any way other than through sealed proposals or sealed bids, the board of commissioners will authorize such process and procedures. Such procedures shall permit as much competition as possible consistent with obtaining qualified persons and/or firms to perform necessary professional services. The selection process may vary for each type of professional service or according to the purpose of an individual contract.

                  Surplus property may be sold by any means deemed most advantageous to the county under the particular circumstances, as determined by the board of commissioners. A sale to a private person shall be for highest net purchase price reasonably obtainable by the county. A sale to another unit of government shall be a fair and reasonable purchase price, which need not be as high as the purchase price obtainable from a private person.

                  Sec. 2-710. - Open market purchases. 
                  The following are guidelines for open market purchases by the purchasing department. This shall not prohibit formal sealed bids when in the best interest of the county. 
                  Purchases $0.01 to $999.99. The user shall use his/her judgment to source, supply, and determine the appropriate number of quotations to obtain. The user shall submit the request via the request for procurement form located on the employees only website. The user must use approved vendors with existing county contracts. New vendors will only be used in extenuating circumstances. 
                  For routine maintenance, building repairs, and planned projects, the department head or their designee may request to purchase items necessary to keep their department functioning, with prior approval by purchasing, provided they ensure funds are available in the appropriate budget line item. Purchasing has the right to substitute like items if a comparable, less costly item can be found. Purchasing also has the right to request additional justification for the expenditure. Once approved, each receiving receipt must be signed by the department head or their designee and coded to the correct line item before submittal to the finance department. A list of approved designees for each department must be on file in the purchasing department and approved by the department head. 
                  If funds are not available, it is the department head's responsibility to make arrangements with the budget and grant analyst to transfer funds to the appropriate line item before any purchase is made. 
                  Purchases $1,000.00 to $9,999.99. The user shall get written quotations for not fewer than three prospective bidders. (Exception: proprietary items and sole source items.) If purchased as a proprietary or sole source item, it should be indicated on the request for procurement form, and all supporting documents should be attached. (Approval of purchases to be made by the budget and grant analyst or finance director prior to notification of bidders.) 
                  Purchases $10,000.00 to $19,999.99. These typically require informal (non-advertised) sealed bids. (Exceptions: Proprietary items and sole source items) If purchased as a proprietary or sole source item, it should be indicated on the request for procurement form, and all supporting documents should be attached. (Approval of purchases to be made by the budget and grant analyst or finance director prior to notification of bidders.) 
                  Whenever possible, long term contracts should be obtained for supplying consumable commodities, such as motor oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, tires, batteries, and other items for which monthly or periodic requirements can be reasonably forecasted. Contracts or purchase agreements should extend no longer than a one year period. Any contracts for greater than one year shall meet the requirements of the O.C.G.A. The purchasing agent shall make periodic checks to assure the party under contract is not escalating his delivery price beyond current market prices. 
                  Whenever possible, all fixed asset purchases and bids for non-consumable commodities such as office equipment and furniture, heavy equipment, and vehicles will be combined upon written request from the purchasing agent. This shall be done as an effort to obtain volume discounts and reduce costs for processing paperwork. 
                  NOTE: Nothing in this policy should be interpreted as to limit competition. Each is to use his/her best judgment in securing all competition reasonably available. Employees are encouraged to attain competition regardless of the amount. All purchases will be from contracts when they are available.

                  The fleet maintenance administrative coordinator may purchase parts up to $2,000.00 without a purchase order. The fleet maintenance administrative coordinator shall purchase certain items, such as tires, using a "blanket purchase order." The purchasing agent shall issue the purchase orders on an "as needed" basis for their use. All purchases shall comply with the purchasing policy. All invoices for purchases must be submitted to accounts payable and the purchasing department not fewer than two times per week. Purchase order numbers shall be shown on all invoices, packing lists, or other correspondence referencing a purchase.

                  Sec. 2-712. - Emergency purchases. 
                  Some purchases under maintenance and repairs may fall under the guidelines for emergency purchases, which is defined as the purchasing of equipment, materials, supplies, or services without obtaining bids during any emergency situation where the purchase is required to protect or preserve human life or property, or provide essential services. 
                  In order to improve the purchasing department service to other departments and continue the control of purchasing, the finance department shall determine what the requesting department needs to purchase and why the request cannot be submitted under normal operating procedure. All emergency orders must have justification on the purchase requisition. 
                  If it is determined by the finance department that there is a bona fide emergency, the following understanding must be agreed upon and information obtained: 
                  (1)  The department in question must obtain approval from the finance director for purchases totaling $1,000.00 to $9,999.99 and from the county manager for purchases totaling $10,000.00 to $19,999.99. The purchasing agent does not have the authority to approve funds; 
                  (2)  Successful vendor's name and mailing address; 
                  (3)  Name(s) and telephone number(s) of bidder(s) contracted; 
                  (4)  Furnish the name of the item(s); 
                  (5)  Price of item(s); 
                  (6)  Discount terms; 
                  (7)  F.O.B. points; and 
                  (8)  Total amount of order. 
                  If the amount is $1,000.00 or greater, the department in question must indicate on the requisition the names of not fewer than three vendors contacted, unless sole source or proprietary items. When obtaining quotes, the department in question shall get the price, terms, etc., and must inform the vendors that the price is F.O.B. point of delivery.

                  Sec. 2-713. - Request for procurement. 
                  Requests for the procurement of materials, services, and supplies should be originated via the request for procurement form on the employees only website by the department head or a designated employee. Once submitted, the purchasing agent enters the purchase requests into the financial software. The purchasing agent maintains the master vendor file but does not maintain the chart of accounts, does not initiate checks for expenditures, and does not issue debit memos. 
                  The following are guidelines for procurement requests: 
                  (1)  Requested items are to be clearly and completely described including technical data, sketches, blueprints, etc., when needed. 
                  (2)  Sources of supply may be suggested but are not necessarily binding on the purchasing agent. 
                  (3)  Requests for procurement received by the purchasing agent should be analyzed and reviewed for clarity and completeness to ensure procurement of the correct merchandise. 
                  (4)  The user department is responsible for verifying availability of budgeted funds before making a purchase. Any department exceeding their budget will be held to emergency purchases only. 
                  (5)  If the user department prefers a particular brand or make of article, valid reasons for such preference must be noted on the request. 
                  (6)  Any request that is not properly completed will be returned to the department for completion. 
                  (7)  Nothing will be ordered without a completed request for procurement, unless deemed an emergency and approved by the finance director and/or county manager, as necessary. No exceptions.

                  Sec. 2-714. - Purchase orders. 
                  After the purchase requisitions have been completed by the purchasing agent and approved by either the finance director or budget and grant analyst, a purchase order will be issued. The purchase order is completed from information on the requisition and from quotation inquiries. 
                  (1)  A purchase order is created by assigning a purchase order number to a requisition and/or a copy of approved bid tabulation. 
                  (2)  Vendor ships supplies to designated shipping point and mails invoice to the finance department, Attn: Accounts Payable. 
                  (3)  Shipment is inspected by receiving department head for conformity to specifications. 
                  (4)  Purchasing agent verifies invoice and shipping receipt with the purchase order.

                  (6)  Purchasing agent enters receiving information into file and forwards invoice and shipping receipt to accounts payable to be paid.

                  Once the purchase order has been issued, a copy should be maintained in an open purchase order file in the purchasing department, and a copy should be sent to the requesting department to return when the item(s) are received. The requesting department should send the receiving copy of the purchase order and packing slips as proof of delivery. Purchasing should match the receiving documents to the purchase order from the open file and hold until an invoice is received. All three documents (P.O., receiving record and invoice) should be forwarded to accounts payable for payment.

                  Except for cash in certain restricted and special funds, the county will consolidate cash balances from all funds to maximize investment earnings. Investment income will be allocated to the various funds based on their respective participation and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

                  Sec. 2-743. - Objectives. 
                  The primary objectives, in priority order, of investment activities shall be safety, liquidity, and yield: 
                  (1)  Safety of principal. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The objective will be to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk. 
                  (2)  Credit risk. The county government office of financial administration will minimize credit risk, the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, by limiting investments to the safest types of securities; pre-qualifying the financial institutions, broker/dealers, intermediaries, and advisers with which the county government will do business; and diversifying the investment portfolio so that potential losses on individual securities will be minimized. 
                  (3)  Interest rate risk. The county government office of financial administration will minimize the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in general interest rates, by structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity; and investing operating funds primarily in shorter-term securities, money market mutual funds, or similar investment pools. 
                  (4)  Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands (static liquidity). Furthermore, since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity). A portion of the portfolio also may be placed in money market mutual funds or local government investment pools which offer same-day liquidity for short term funds. 
                  (5)  Yield. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described in subsection (4) of this section. The core of investments are limited to relatively low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed. Securities shall not be sold prior to maturity with the following exceptions: 
                  a.  A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of principal. 
                  b.  A security swap would improve the quality, yield, or target duration in the portfolio. 
                  c.  Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold.

                  Sec. 2-744. - Standards of care. 
                  (a)  Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the prudent person standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written procedures and this investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in accordance with the terms of this policy. Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived. 
                  (b)  Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business. They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio. Employees and officers shall refrain from undertaking personal investment transactions with the same individual with whom business is conducted on behalf of the county government. 
                  (c)  Delegation of authority. Authority to manage the investment program is to be delegated by the board of commissioners after review of the proposed investment program. The delegated individual hereinafter referred to as investment officer and derived from code section as determined by the board and legal counsel. Responsibility for the operation of the investment program is hereby delegated to the investment officer, who shall act in accordance with established written procedures and internal controls for the operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy. Procedures will include all written internal control practices, safekeeping, delivery verses payment, investment accounting, repurchase agreements, wire transfer agreements, and collateral/depository agreements. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the investment officer. The investment officer shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials.

                  Sec. 2-745. - Authorized financial dealers and institutions. 
                  (a)  A list will be maintained of financial institutions authorized to provide investment services. In addition, a list also will be maintained of approved security broker/dealers selected by creditworthiness (i.e., a minimum capital requirement of $10,000,000.00 and at least five years of operation). These may include primary dealers or regional dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15C3-1 (Uniform Net Capital Rule). 
                  (b)  All financial institutions and broker/dealers who desire to become qualified for investment transactions must supply the following as appropriate: 
                  (1)  Audited financial statements. 
                  (2)  Proof of National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) certification. 
                  (3)  Proof of state registration. 
                  (4)  Completed broker/dealer questionnaire. 
                  (5)  Certification of having read and understood and agreeing to comply with the county investment policy. 
                  (c)  An annual review of the financial condition and registration of qualified financial institutions and broker/dealers will be conducted by the investment officer. 
                  (d)  From time to time, the investment officer may choose to invest in instruments offered by minority and community financial institutions. In such situations, a waiver to the criteria under subsection (a) of this section may be granted. All terms and relationships will be fully disclosed prior to purchase and will be reported to the appropriate entity on a consistent basis and should be consistent with state or local law. These types of investment purchases should be approved by the appropriate legislative or governing body in advance.

                  Sec. 2-746. - Internal controls. 
                  (a)  The investment officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the county government are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal control structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: 
                  (1)  The cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived; and 
                  (2)  The valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by management. 
                  (b)  Accordingly, the investment officer shall establish a process for an annual independent review by an external auditor to ensure compliance with policies and procedures. The internal controls shall address the following points: 
                  (1)  Control of collusion. 
                  (2)  Separation of transaction authority from accounting and recordkeeping. 
                  (3)  Custodial safekeeping. 
                  (4)  Avoidance of physical delivery securities. 
                  (5)  Clear delegation of authority to subordinate staff members. 
                  (6)  Written confirmation of transactions for investments and wire transfers. 
                  (7)  Development of a wire transfer agreement with the lead bank and third-party custodian.

                  Sec. 2-747. - Delivery versus payment. 
                  All trades where applicable will be executed by delivery versus payment (DVP) to ensure that securities are deposited in an eligible financial institution prior to the release of funds. The securities will be held by a third-party custodian as evidenced by safekeeping receipts.

                  Consistent with the GFOA policy statement on state and local laws concerning investment practices, the following investments will be permitted by this policy and are those defined by state and local law where applicable: 
                  (1)  U.S. government obligations, U.S. government agency obligations, and U.S. government instrumentality obligations, which have a liquid market with a readily determinable market value; 
                  (2)  Canadian government obligations (payable in local currency); 
                  (3)  Certificates of deposit and other evidences of deposit at financial institutions, bankers' acceptances, and commercial paper, rated in the highest tier (e.g., A-1, P-1, F-1, or D-1 or higher) by a nationally recognized rating agency; 
                  (4)  Investment-grade obligations of state, provincial and local governments and public authorities; 
                  (5)  Repurchase agreements whose underlying purchased securities consist of the foregoing; 
                  (6)  Money market mutual funds regulated by the securities and exchange commission and whose portfolios consist only of dollar-denominated securities; 
                  (7)  Local government investment pools, either state-administered or through joint powers statutes and other intergovernmental agreement legislation; and 
                  (8)  Investment in derivatives of the instruments in this section shall require authorization by the appropriate governing authority.

                  Sec. 2-751. - Investment parameters. 
                  Investments shall be diversified by: 
                  (1)  Limiting investments to avoid overconcentration in securities from a specific issuer or business sector (excluding U.S. Treasury securities); 
                  (2)  Limiting investment in securities that have higher credit risks, investing in securities with varying maturities, and continuously investing a portion of the portfolio in readily available funds such as local government investment pools (LGIPs), money market funds or overnight repurchase agreements to ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in order to meet ongoing obligations. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-65, § VI(1), 10-21-2005) 
                  Sec. 2-752. - Maximum maturities. 
                  (a)  To the extent possible, the county shall attempt to match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow, the county government office financial administration will not directly invest in securities maturing more than five years from the date of purchase or in accordance with state and local statutes and ordinances. The county government shall adopt weighted average maturity limitations (which often range from 90 days to three years), consistent with the investment objectives. 
                  (b)  Reserve funds and other funds with longer-term investment horizons may be invested in securities exceeding five years if the maturity of such investments is made to coincide as nearly as practicable with the expected use of funds. The intent to invest in securities with longer maturities shall be disclosed in writing to the legislative body. 
                  (c)  Because of inherent difficulties in accurately forecasting cash flow requirements, a portion of the portfolio should be continuously invested in readily available funds such as LGIPs, money market funds, or overnight repurchase agreements to ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained to meet ongoing obligations.

                  Sec. 2-753. - Reporting. 
                  The investment officer shall prepare an investment report at least quarterly, including a management summary that provides an analysis of the status of the current investment portfolio and transactions made over the last quarter. This management summary will be prepared in a manner which will allow the board of commissioners to ascertain whether investment activities during the reporting period have conformed to the investment policy. The report should be provided to the investment officer, the legislative body, and any pool participants. The report will include the following: 
                  (1)  Listing of individual securities held at the end of the reporting period. 
                  (2)  Realized and unrealized gains or losses resulting from appreciation or depreciation by listing the cost and market value of securities over one-year duration that are not intended to be held until maturity (in accordance with governmental accounting standards board (GASB) requirements).

                  (4)  Listing of investment by maturity date.

                  The investment portfolio will be managed in accordance with the parameters specified within this policy. The portfolio should obtain a market average rate of return during a market/economic environment of stable interest rates. A series of appropriate benchmarks shall be established against which portfolio performance shall be compared on a regular basis.

                  The market value of the portfolio shall be calculated at least quarterly and a statement of the market value of the portfolio shall be issued at least quarterly. This will ensure that review of the investment portfolio, in terms of value and price volatility, has been performed consistent with the GFOA recommended practice on market-to-market practices for state and local government investment portfolios and investment pools. Market value is defined as the current market price of a security. Market-to-market is the process whereby the book value or collateral value of a security is adjusted to reflect its current market value.

                  Covered account includes all accounts administered by the county. 
                  Identifying information means any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person, including: name, address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification number, computer's internet protocol address, or routing code. 
                  Identity theft means a fraud committed or attempted using the identifying information of another person without authority.

                  Sec. 2-848. - Program adoption. 
                  The county board of commissioners (board) developed this identity theft prevention program (program) pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission's Red Flags Rule (Rule), which implements section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, 16 CFR 681.2. This program was developed with oversight and approval of the board of commissioners. After consideration of the size and complexity of the county's operations and account systems, and the nature and scope of the county's activities, the board determined that this program was appropriate for the county, and therefore approved this program on May 21, 2009.

                  Sec. 2-849. - Program purpose. 
                  Under the Red Flag Rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an identity theft prevention program tailored to its size, complexity and the nature of its operation. Each program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to: 
                  (1)  Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program; 
                  (2)  Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; 
                  (3)  Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and 
                  (4)  Ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity theft. 
                  (Res. No. 2009-34, exh. A(I(A)), 5-21-2009) 
                  Sec. 2-850. - Identification of red flags. 
                  In order to identify relevant red flags, the county considers the types of accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous experiences with identity theft. The county identifies the following red flags, in each of the listed categories: 
                  (1)  Notifications and warnings from credit reporting agencies. 
                  a.  Report of fraud accompanying a credit report; 
                  b.  Notice or report from a credit agency of a credit freeze on a customer or applicant; 
                  c.  Notice or report from a credit agency of an active duty alert for an applicant; and

                  Sec. 2-853. - Program updates. 
                  The county will periodically review and update this program to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the county from identity theft. In doing so, the county will consider the county's experiences with identity theft situations, changes in identity theft methods, changes in identity theft detection and prevention methods, and changes in the county's business arrangement with other entities. After considering these factors, the program administrator will determine whether changes to the program, included the listing of red flags, are warranted. If warranted, the county will update the program.

                  Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating this program lies with an identity theft committee for the county. The committee is headed by a program administrator who may be the head of the county or his appointee. The program administrator position will be held by the county risk management coordinator. Two or more other individuals appointed by the head of the county or the program administrator comprise the remainder of the committee membership. The remaining positions are identified as the director of finance and the commander of criminal investigation division of the sheriff's office. The program administrator will be responsible for the program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of county staff on the program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to the program.

                  Sec. 2-857. - Specific program elements and confidentiality. 
                  For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, knowledge about specific red flag identification, detection, mitigation and prevention practices may need to be limited to the committee who developed this program and to those employees with a need to know them. Any documents that may have been produced or are produced in order to develop or implement this program that list or describe such specific practices and the information those documents contain are considered confidential and should not be shared with other employees or the public. The program administrator shall inform the committee and those employees that handle sensitive information of those documents or specific practices that should be maintained in a confidential manner. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.

                  ARTICLE XII. - LOCAL VENDOR PREFERENCE POLICY 

                  Sec. 2-871. - Purpose. 
                  The Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners hereby establishes a local vendor preference policy in recognition of the vital contribution made by local businesses by providing employment, and contributing to the local tax base. Departments are encouraged to use local vendors whenever possible. However, the county has an obligation to the taxpayers to use financial resources wisely and cannot always utilize local vendors.

                  Sec. 2-872. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  County shall mean Lumpkin County, Georgia. 
                  Out of county vendor (out of jurisdiction) shall mean any vendor that does not have a physical presence within the geographic boundaries of Lumpkin County, Georgia. Physical presence constitutes ownership of property, maintains, operates, or occupies office space, warehouse, or other physical business structure. Use of a post office box does not constitute a physical presence for purposes of this policy. 
                  Local vendor shall mean a business which maintains a valid business license and a principal business office, or a satellite office with at least one full-time employee, located in the county. Local vendor shall have a street address and should be able to easily demonstrate that goods or services to be procured by the county are either made, stored, processed, sold or rendered at such establishment or facility; and, that substantial administrative or management activities related to the establishment or facility are performed by one or more employees, principals, representatives, or agents for the purpose of transacting business. It shall be the responsibility of the vendor to provide evidence of meeting this standard to the satisfaction of the county prior to the award of a bid or quote. 
                  Responsible bidder shall mean a bidder who has the capability in all respects to perform fully the contract requirements, and the experience, integrity, perseverance, reliability, capacity, facilities, equipment, and credit which will assure good faith performance. 
                  Responsive bidder shall mean a bidder who has submitted a bid which conforms m all material respects to the requirements stated in the invitation to bid.

                  (a)  If the local vendor is responsible, responsive, and within five percent of the lowest responsible, responsive bid submitted by any out-of-county vendor, the local vendor will be provided notice by the county and given the opportunity to reduce its bid/quote to match the bid/quote offered by the out-of-county vendor. The local vendor shall have three business days after the date of such notice to match the lowest bid/quote in writing. If such local vendor agrees to match the bid/quote received from the out-of-county vendor within the time specified by the county, it will be deemed the lowest responsible bidder/quote and receive the award. 
                  (b)  Should the lowest responsible local vendor decline to match the lowest bid/quote in writing, the county shall provide the next lowest responsible local bidder/quote who is within five percent of the lowest responsible bidder/quote with the same notice an opportunity to match the bid/quote of the lowest responsible bidder as outlined in subsection (a) above. This process shall continue as necessary until an award is made either to a responsible local vendor bidder/quote who is within five percent of the lowest responsible bidder, or the lowest responsible bidder itself. 
                  (c)  Preference shall be given to the local vendor in an instance where a local vendor and out of county vendor submit equivalent lowest responsible bids/quotes. 
                  (d)  Local vendor awarded any bid/quote shall not assign or sub-contract more than 50 percent of the dollar value of the contract to be performed by any entity that is not a local vendor as defined by the policy. 
                  (e)  In the event the only bidders/quotes are local vendors, the bid/quote shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder/quote. 
                  (f)  In the event there are two or more local vendors within five percent of the lowest bid/quote and/or whose bid is tied, the county shall determine first by the length of time the local vendor has been located within Lumpkin County, Georgia, and then, if necessary, the previous experience with said local vendor.

                  The definition of grant administration for the purposes of this policy is as follows: Any activity or function required on the part of county staff or the chairman of the board of commissioners related to the submission of an application or implementation of a grant award. 
                  The purpose of the grant procedures outlined in this document is:

                  This policy is applicable to any Lumpkin County department, constitutional/elected county official, or division preparing and submitting grant applications to agencies outside the county government for funds, materials, or equipment to be received and administered by the county or by an agency for which the county acts as the fiscal agent. The goals and objectives of the county departments should be established early in the planning process and should not change based upon changes in the availability of different funding sources sought and received. If the grant policies and regulations conflict with regulations and policies of the county, the federal and state regulations will prevail unless such regulations are less restrictive than the county policies whereby the county policy prevails. 
                  No grant will be accepted that will incur management reporting costs greater than the grant amount. Such costs include, but are not limited to, indirect costs, overhead and any other items needed to administer the grant.

As a rule, federal and state regulations prevail unless less restrictive than county policies, where county policies prevail.

                  Sec. 2-900. - Board of commissioners exemption. 
                  The board of commissioners may, at their discretion, exempt any grant from this policy. The previous exemption authorized by the board of commissioners related to equipment grants for the sheriffs office not requiring matching funds remains in effect.

                  (b)  Where the applicant is a partnership, limited liability company or corporation, the provisions of this section shall apply to all its partners, officers, manager and majority stockholders. In the case of a corporation the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and the majority stockholder, if an individual. Where the majority stockholder is not an individual, the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and its agent registered under the provisions of this subsection. In the case of a partnership the license will be issued to all the partners owning 20 percent or more of the partnership. If no partner owns 20 percent or more of the partnership, then the general partner, managing partner or the partner with the greatest ownership will be licensed. In the case of a limited liability company, the license will be issued jointly to the limited liability company and manager. 
                  (c)  No person, firm, limited liability company or corporation shall be granted any alcoholic beverage license unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the board of commissioners or their designee that such person, manager, partners in the firm, or officers and directors of the corporation have not been convicted or plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to and have been released from parole or probation concerning any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexual related crime within a period of ten years immediately prior to the filing of such application.

An applicant's first conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a county ordinance shall not, by itself, make an applicant ineligible for an alcohol license. Should any applicant, partner, or officer instrumental in the sale or dispensing of any alcoholic beverage, after a license has been granted, be convicted or plead guilty or nolo contendere to a crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexual related crime, the license shall be immediately revoked and cancelled.

                  (g)  The board of commissioners may decline to issue a license when any person having any ownership interest in the operation of such place of business or control over such place of business does not meet the same character requirements as set forth in this section for the licensee. 
                  (h)  All licensed establishments must have and continuously maintain in the county a registered agent upon whom any process, notice or demand required or permitted by law or under this chapter to be served upon the licensee or owner may be served. This person must be a resident of the county. The licensee shall file the name of such agent, along with the written consent of such agent, with the board of commissioners and shall be in such form as they may prescribe. 
                  (i)  A license application may be denied to any applicant for any alcoholic beverage license where it appears that the applicant would not have adequate financial participation in the proposed business to direct and manage its affairs, or where it appears that the application is intended to be a mere surrogate for a person who would not otherwise qualify for a license for any reason whatsoever. 
                  (j)  For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which a defendant who was allowed to avail themselves of the state First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq., as amended. Except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender.

                  (c)  If a license is surrendered or a licensee severs his association with a licensed establishment, the establishment may continue to sell alcoholic beverages for a period of 45 days from the date of surrender, or from the date determined by the board of commissioners to be the date of severance, provided no such sale shall be authorized until such time as a new application for a license is made. The application shall indicate that no change of ownership has occurred, except as excepted in this section. Upon issuance of a new license, the authorization to sell under the previous license shall be revoked by operation of law. No additional license fees shall be required during the period for which the original license was issued. 
                  (d)  Nothing in this section, however, shall prohibit one or more of the partnership holding a license to withdraw from the partnership in favor of one or more of the partners who were partners at the time of the issuance of the license. This section shall not prohibit transfer of stock between persons who held stock in the corporation at the time of issuance of the license nor shall it prohibit transfers of stock which do not result in any person increasing his stock holdings to a total of ten percent or more of any class of stock. 
                  (e)  Except as provided in subsections (a) through (d) of this section, any change in the ownership of any entity owning a licensed establishment shall cancel and revoke any license pursuant to this chapter automatically, without the necessity of any hearing. 
                  (f)  Should a licensee make application to the board of commissioners for a transfer of location and should such a transfer of a location be approved, with no change of ownership of the business, the license fee paid for the previous license shall be applied to the new location. Each applicant for a transfer of location shall pay a transfer fee in the amount provided in the county fee schedule.

                  Sec. 6-19. - Purpose of article. 
                  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 8-1. - Reserved. 
                  Sec. 8-2. - ADA Service Animals Policy—Lumpkin County Facilities. 
                  (a)  Purpose. Under the ADA, local governments must allow service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of a facility where the public is normally allowed to go. This policy defines service animals, allows non-service animals to be in facilities for certain special events and programs, sets policy that non-service animals are not allowed in county facilities, and sets parameters for service animals as detailed by the ADA. 
                  (b)  Definition. Only dogs and miniature horses are recognized as service animals. Service animals are not required to wear vests identifying them as such. A service animal is any dog (or miniature horse) trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability. The work or task a dog (or miniature horse) has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person's disability, such as guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, calming a person with PTSD during an anxiety attack, etc. Service animals are not required to be licensed or certified by a state or local government to qualify for protection under ADA. Search and rescue and police dogs are excluded from this policy. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA. 
                  (c)  Policy statement. Lumpkin County has an obligation to operate public facilities in a safe, sanitary manner. In order to meet this obligation, only service animals will be allowed in county facilities. Lumpkin County reserves the right to verify that an animal is truly a service animal. If it is obvious what the service animal's function is, staff are not allowed to ask any questions. 
                  When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only two questions are allowed: 
                  (1)  Is the dog a service animal that is required because of a disability? (Do not ask about the disability.) 
                  (2)  What specific work or task has the dog been trained to perform? (Do not ask for documentation for the dog or ask for a demonstration of the dog performing its work or task.) 
                  Service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered unless these devices interfere with the service animal's work or the individual's disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or some other effective method. 
                  A person with a disability may be asked to remove his service animal from the facility if: 
                  (1)  The dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it. 
                  (2)  The dog is not housebroken. 
                  When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, the individual must be offered some other avenue to obtain the goods or services needed. 
                  Individuals using service animals may not be isolated from other patrons, treated less favorably, or charged fees that are not charged to other patrons without animals. 
                  Allergies and fear of dogs are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service animals. 
                  Lumpkin County staff are prohibited from providing care, food, or water for a service animal. 
                  This policy does not apply to special events and programs that may involve the use of non-service animals. Such programs and events should be reported to the county manager's office two weeks prior to the event. (An example of such an event would be the Chestatee Regional Library System's "Read to a Dog" program.)

This election shall become a part of the permit and must be made at the time the initial building permit is requested. Any use of such ungraded or rough sawed lumber without such written election, except as may otherwise be permitted by the provisions of the code, shall be prima facie evidence of a code violation and shall be grounds for an automatic issuance of a stop work order. In such case after issuance of the stop work order a review by the building official shall be made within ten working days, and any review within such time period shall be considered a timely review. If, after review, the building official determines that such use was not elected at the time the initial application for a building permit was made, the nonconforming materials shall be removed and replaced by conforming materials.

                  Sec. 14-2. - Lumpkin County Emergency Services Uniform Patch. 

                  Emergency services in its true definition encompasses the delivery of fire/rescue, emergency medical services, and emergency management. This design was developed by members of the Lumpkin County Emergency Services led by Lieutenant Ryan Estes. The power of patriotism and mission of service is embedded within the emblem. 
                  The new patch contains the approved county seal with the traditional fire service Maltese Cross. Listed in each section of the cross are the services which the Lumpkin County Emergency Service represents. The dual American flags represent the community's patriotism and allows service members to wear the patches appropriately on each arm. Medical certification is placed as customized rocker on the right sleeve to fulfill state requirements, and specialty team designation rockers may be added. 
                  Emergency Services ensures public safety by addressing different emergencies: Fire, Emergency Medicine, Rescue, and Disaster Management and Recovery (natural or manmade). By redeveloping the name of emergency services to encompass all of its functions, emergency services seeks to unify all branches within the Service, strengthen their position within the region and become compliant with National Fire Protection Association, National Incident Management System, and Georgia Emergency Management Agency standards.

                  Sec. 14-147. - Persons unable to pay; internal policy. 
                  The county recognizes that in some cases the expense of pursuing such cost recovery against indigents or other persons not capable of providing such reimbursement and defrayal of costs would exceed the benefits of any recovery. The EMA director shall provide by internal policy, with the consent and approval of the board of commissioners for those categories of individuals to be subject to a rebuttable presumption of nonpayment.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The "actual start" means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. The term "permanent construction" does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of roads and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Accessory structures are not exempt from any article requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the term "actual start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

                  (1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. (The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.) The term "substantial improvement" includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. Substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  (2)  The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
                  a.  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the roads, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the roads, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 16-22. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  DIVISION 3. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 16-103. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components including ductwork, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 16-104. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-103(4), elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in zone A1-30, AE, or AH, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions in this subsection, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in section 16-72(a)(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, as referenced in section 16-103(6). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a. through (3)c. of this section. No recreational vehicle may be used as a residence or occupied for more than 90 days without approval of a variance from the county planning commission. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-25, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. 
                  b.  Development may be permitted; provided, however, it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  c.  Only if section (4)a. of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.

                  Sec. 16-105. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-25, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 16-25, then the planning director shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this division. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the provisions in section (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a six-inch increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-103(4) pertaining to elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. The planning director shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Sec. 16-130. - Procedures. 
                  (a)  The county planning commission as established by the governing authority of the county shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the planning director in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this division are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create public annoyance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

                  Sec. 16-161. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsection (b), (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/ BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsection (b), (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (16) and (17) of this section, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to Code Section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to Code Section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this subsection maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 16-162. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county without first obtaining a permit from the planning department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the county planning department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 16-161(b), (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by six copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the District for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, and any variances required by section 16-161(c) (15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 16-162 (b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised Plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 16-161(b), (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and State laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 16-161(c) (15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 16-162 (b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7 (f) (1). 
                  (Res. No. 2010-05, § V, 1-21-2010; Ord. No. 2018-42, Exh. A, 7-24-2018) 
                  Sec. 16-163. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The planning department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.

                  (c)  The planning department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to Code Section 12-7-8 (a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7 (e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Minor land disturbing activities, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(3), means home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion. Additional criteria to be considered: 
                  (1)  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed. 
                  (2)  Minor land disturbing does not apply to disturbance associated with nonresidential construction projects. The Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 intends for the minor land disturbing exemption to apply only to activities associated with individual homes and does not extend the exemption to any similar activities not associated with individual homes. Therefore, the exemption applies to individual home gardens, individual home landscaping, individual home repairs, individual home maintenance work, individual home fences, and other related individual home activities where the cumulative impact to the buffer does not exceed a total of 100 square feet. Appropriate best management practices are to be designed, installed, and maintained for exempt projects to control erosion and sedimentation for the duration of the project and until final stabilization is achieved. 
                  (3)  The term minor land disturbance is not found in the NPDES general construction permits and is therefore not applicable to sites covered by the general permits. For common developments, once an individual lot meets the criteria for notice of termination (NOT) submittal and an NOT has been properly submitted to EPD, land disturbance by the homeowner within the buffer may meet the criteria of minor land disturbance and may therefore be exempt from the variance requirement. For residential stand alone construction projects minor land disturbance may apply once the project meets the criteria for NOT submittal and an NOT has been properly submitted to EPD. The minor land disturbance exemption would not apply to nonresidential stand alone construction projects.

                  Sec. 16-242. - Intent and purpose. 
                  This guideline is intended to clarify the land disturbing activities that can occur within the state-protected stream buffer under the minor land disturbance exemption and without a variance from EPD.

                  Sec. 16-243. - For minor land disturbing activities within the state-protected stream buffer. 
                  (a)  The following land disturbing activities are examples of projects in addition to those specifically listed in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(3) that would be considered minor land disturbing and do not require a buffer variance: 
                  (1)  Elevated structures such as decks, gazebos, patios, walkways, viewing platforms or open picnic shelters provided: 
                  a.  No more than 100 square feet of footprint of the elevated structure extends into or over the buffer; 
                  b.  No grading, cutting, filling or similar land disturbing activities occur as a part of site preparation, construction or subsequent development; 
                  c.  The structure is built on posts, concrete blocks or similar; 
                  d.  Permanent protective vegetative cover remains or protective measures (e.g. mulch, gravel) are installed within the footprint of the elevated structure to prevent post-construction erosion and to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; 
                  e.  A natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; 
                  f.  No poured or prefab concrete or asphalt slabs, pads or foundations are constructed or placed as a part of site preparation, structure construction, or subsequent development; and 
                  (2)  A pervious ground level walkway approach to a dock or similar structure provided: 
                  a.  No more than 100 square feet of the constructed walkway extends into or over the buffer; 
                  b.  No grading, cutting, filling or similar land disturbing activities occur as a part of site preparation, construction or subsequent development; 
                  c.  No poured or prefab concrete or asphalt slabs, pads, supports or foundations are constructed or placed as a part of site preparation, structure construction, or subsequent development; and 
                  d.  All ground preparation and walkway material placement is completed with the use of handheld equipment. 
                  (b)  The following land disturbing activities are examples of projects that would not be considered minor land disturbing and would require a buffer variance. 
                  (1)  Any land disturbance utilizing wheeled or tracked machinery or equipment that enters or is physically located within the state waters buffer. 
                  (2)  Paving with concrete and/or asphalt. 
                  (3)  Any project or combination of projects on the same property which results in more than 100 square feet of structure and/or walkway within or extending into the buffer regardless of when the construction takes place. 
                  (4)  The construction of a barbeque pit. 
                  (5)  The construction of a ground-level patio. 
                  (6)  The construction of a swimming pool. 
                  (7)  The construction of a structural or decorative retaining wall. 
                  (8)  The construction of a seawall where land disturbance within the state waters buffer will occur. 
                  (9)  Backfilling any seawall construction within the state waters buffer. 
                  (10)  The construction or placement of any structure resulting in the removal or eventual loss of permanent protective vegetation around or underneath the structure, thereby allowing post-construction erosion to occur.

                  The following are the guidelines, which the county uses for those unable to pay funeral expenses. The county believes in the reverence and dignity of the deceased and will always hold the utmost respect for both the deceased and their families. 
                  (1)  Because the primary responsibility is with the family, the county will not become involved unless there is truly a need. As with any expenditure by the county government, we are held accountable to the taxpayers of the county. In any situation where indigent services are requested, certain criteria must be met and an affidavit signed stating the deceased is truly indigent and no family member is capable of paying funeral expenses. The county Staff will also utilize DFACS as a source to verify indigent status. 
                  (2)  The request for these services must be made only when there is truly an indigent need and the funeral director and/or the county commissioners must be made fully aware of the financial circumstances of the parties involved. After consideration of these circumstances, the request will be considered. 
                  (3)  Should the county accept responsibility, the following services and merchandise will be provided at a cost not to exceed $500.00: 
                  a.  Removal of remains. 
                  b.  Embalming with no restoration. 
                  c.  Minimum casket. 
                  d.  Open and close grave. 
                  e.  Graveside service. 
                  f.  Two-hour visitation, same day as service. 
                  (4)  In the event that the provided services exceed $500.00, the county reserves the right to remove one or more items from the list. 
                  (5)  Anything other than the items listed above must be paid for in advance by the family of the deceased. If you choose to upgrade the services and merchandise, this agreement is void and the family is responsible for all expenses. 
                  (6)  Cremation is an acceptable practice and if it is the family's desire, it will be considered as an option.

This is a density-based subdivision with the overall density being one unit per gross acre. Minimum side setbacks are ten feet and rear setbacks are 20 feet. Flag lots are not allowed. The minimum lot size is one-eighth acre. All class V subdivisions must have curb and gutter, and must also provide sidewalks along one side of the street. A minimum of 40 percent of the total tract must be designated as greenspace and must be left as natural as possible, but the greenspace area may be used for passive recreation (hiking trails, etc.) Covenants that provide for protection of the greenspace areas must be presented to the planning commission. These covenants must be referenced in the final plat and recorded with the final plat. The covenants must indicate that each lot be given an undivided interest in the greenspace common areas. The following statement will be placed on the final plat: 
                  "Each lot of this subdivision will have an undivided interest in the greenspace common area." 
                  (b)  Where the developer desires to use recreation fields or a golf course as part of the green space calculations, the value for this area is calculated at the rate of 50 percent of the value of natural greenspace. Recreation or golf course greenspace may show ownership by a legal corporation. The minimum tract size for a class V designation is 20 acres. A class V (greenspace subdivision) must have a minimum building setback of 100 feet from the right-of-way of any existing state or county road with the first 50 feet being an undisturbed, supplemented or planted buffer. (This may be reduced by the planning commission for reason).

                  Sec. 26-65. - Class VI subdivision. 
                  This classification will be used for mixed use developments (commercial single-family and multifamily residential). The development must be designed for multiple uses. This classification allows the designers to propose to the planning commission a development that they believe will provide the best use of the land and will provide benefit the community as a whole. Multifamily may account for a maximum of 50 percent of the total acreage. The total number of multifamily units allowed must be based on the calculations in the multifamily regulations. The planning commission will review the first preliminary plan for the concept and make recommendations to the developer. The first preliminary must contain a boundary, conceptual site plan, topo (quad data ok) and general utility information. The second preliminary submittal must contain any recommendations from the planning commission, all of the normally required preliminary subdivision information, and a construction/completion schedule. The planning commission must review and approve the second preliminary prior to any development permits being issued. The planning commission has great leeway under the class VI designation. By approval of the preliminary and final plats they are also granting variances from any of the provisions of this regulation. This is done as part of the approval process if the planning commission has determined that the changes are necessary for a quality development and in the overall best interest of the community. The minimum size for a class VI is 20 acres. A class VI subdivision must have a mix of residential and commercial with a maximum of 50 percent of the total area devoted to multifamily and a maximum of 50 percent devoted to commercial.

                  This classification is for estate or farm subdivisions with a minimum lot size of three acres that require the construction of new roads. Within this class subdivision a maximum of 20 percent of the lots may be flag lots with the flagpole being a minimum width of 30 feet and a maximum length of 500 feet. The setbacks within a class VII subdivision are 50 feet from all property lines.

                  The following land subdivisions shall be defined as subdivisions but may be exempted from the requirements of these regulations if it is determined that one of the following criteria is met: 
                  (1)  The combination or recombination of portions of previously approved platted lots where the total number of approved lots is not increased and the resultant lots meet the standards herein. 
                  (2)  The division of land into no more than five parcels of five acres or more, with each lot having direct access to a county road. Any further subdivision of these tracts may only be approved by the planning commission. 
                  (3)  The division of land by either a minor subdivide or a class I subdivision does not require planning commission approval, unless referred to the planning commission by the planning director because of special circumstances. 
                  (Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 209, 7-16-2009)

                  (a)  Any subdivision proposing to use public water must present a letter from the state, the county water authority or municipal water department indicating preliminary approval along with the preliminary plat. All water and/or sewer systems must have all required state and county approvals and be fully operational prior submittal of final plat for approval for recording. 
                  (b)  Because of the severe topography, numerous waterways and potential for erosion, the grading of building lots and roadways at the same time (mass grading) is not permitted without special permission of the planning commission. Additionally, any slope greater (steeper) than a ratio of two units horizontal to one unit vertical (2:1) shall provide and construct a retaining feature. Any retaining feature greater than seven feet in height will require a design by a registered professional engineer. 
                  (c)  All plats shall indicate the date of the most current FEMA's data: to include FIRM Panel numbers, zone boundary and designation, or wording to indicate that the property is not within FEMA's designated special flood hazard areas. Delineate all stream buffers, and if applicable, all building setbacks and other required buffers.

                  (a)  Definitions. The following are definitions and requirements for splitting parcels in a platted subdivision in the county: 
                  Average area means the average area of all the platted lots in a subdivision will be initially determined from GIS and recorded survey data as determined by the planning director. More accurate data set out in a signed and recordable plat of survey may be considered. 
                  Platted subdivision means any subdivision that was platted after the adoption of the county subdivision regulations on April 24, 1975, and recorded by the county clerk of courts. 
                  Subdivision lots means a parcel of land in a platted subdivision that is less than three times the average area of all lots in the subdivision. 
                  Subdivision tract means a parcel of land in a platted subdivision that is greater than three times the average area of all the platted lots in the subdivision. 
                  (b)  All subdivision classes except I, III and VII require a roof pitch of no less than five vertical to 12 horizontal, with an overhang of no less than one foot exclusive of gutters. 
                  (c)  All subdivision classes except I and VII require paved driveways from the edge of the existing paved road to the home or garage. (Classes I and VII require paving from the edge of the existing paved road to the right-of-way only.) 
                  (d)  Subdivision classes IV, V, and VI allow on site construction only, conventional construction. No homes may be moved in. 
                  (e)  All subdivision classes require adequate parking for a minimum of two vehicles on the lot and off of the right-of-way with, if possible, a turnaround area or other provisions to avoid backing vehicles into the street. 
                  (f)  All subdivision classes except I and II require a landscaped entrance and all homes must front on and have their access to a subdivision street. (A ten-foot no-access easement strip shall be provided for all lots abutting along an existing county or state roads). 
                  (g)  All subdivisions classes except I, II and V must have a minimum building setback from any existing state or county road right-of-way of 50 feet with the first 25 feet being an undisturbed, supplemented or planted buffer. 
                  (h)  Class III, IV, V and VII subdivisions, planned developments and a minor subdivide may be designed with private roads, provided that the maintenance of these roads are covered under the covenants or deed of the property and approved by the planning commission. 
                  (i)  Because of the severe topography, numerous waterways and rocky soil conditions any subdivision lots of less than one acre will, prior to the issuance of a building permit, be required to provide a level three soil analysis overlaid on the lot layout with topographical information. Every lot regardless of size must have a preliminary site plan showing the proposed house location, primary and secondary drainfield locations (drainfields must be shown in a suitable soil type), with location of driveways, and any other site amenities. This site plan must be submitted to the department of environmental health with the application for a septic permit. A copy must also accompany the building permit application. 
                  (j)  All preliminary subdivision plats of more than 25 lots submitted for development on a county road which doesn't meet current county road requirements must be submitted with a registered professional engineer's traffic study. This study must show the current traffic volume, the increase in traffic volume from the development, and the traffic capacity of the road. If the proposed traffic volume exceeds the traffic capacity of the road, the developer may be required to improve the road, at his expense, to ensure that the capacity of the road is not exceeded by the proposed development.

The following requirements must be met before the request for division will be heard by the planning commission: 
                  (1)  A sign will be posted on the property by the planning department advertising the date of the meeting. 
                  (2)  A recorded copy of the subdivision covenants must be provided with the application, or an affidavit (under oath) stating that no covenants exist. 
                  (3)  The divider of the tract must send a letter, via certified mail, to the owner of all lots in the subdivision that share a property line with the subject lot. This letter will be addressed to the owner of the lot at the address of the previous year's tax bill and will be postmarked a minimum of two weeks prior to the planning commission hearing on the proposed lot split. The letter shall contain the following statement: 
                  "As owner (or agent of owner) of Lot No._____ in the ___________ Subdivision, which is adjacent to your Lot _____, I am applying for permission from the Lumpkin County Planning Commission to allow my Lot to be subdivided into _____ additional lots. The planning commission meeting will be held on [date]." 
                  (4)  A copy of the letter and the receipt of mailing will be provided to the planning department at least one week prior to the scheduled hearing as proof that this notice was mailed at least two weeks prior to the county planning commission hearing of the lot split. 
                  (5)  No lot resulting from the splitting of a platted subdivision lot may have an area less than the average acreage of all subdivision lots in the platted subdivision. The average acreage of the subdivision lots will be the average of all lots at the adoption of regulation, or as existing at the time of the application, whichever is smaller. 
                  (6)  Each lot resulting from the split must have a minimum of 30 linear feet of frontage on an existing or newly created subdivision road and be accessed from that frontage.

                  (6)  To provide for future modification and expansion. 
                  (b)  Applicability. This standard is applicable to all roads under the jurisdiction of the board of commissioners including frontage roads and service roads of limited access highways. However, these provisions do not apply to roads under the jurisdiction of the state department of transportation. 
                  (c)  Prohibitions. 
                  (1)  Construction of masonry or other substantial structures other than those specifically allowed by this chapter within the county right-of-way or county-owned easements shall be prohibited. 
                  (2)  No sign shall be permitted in county owned right-of-way or easements other than those placed by the governing authority. 
                  (3)  No vehicles, equipment, trailers, boats or other similar items shall be parked, placed, or stored on county owned right-of-way or easements except in the case of an emergency.

                  (1)  Driveway widths shall be a minimum of 15 feet and a maximum of 30 feet for one-way operation and a minimum of 25 feet to a maximum of 40 feet for two-way operation. Driveway widths shall be measured parallel with the existing roadway or, if roadway is on a curve, parallel with the tangent of the curve at the point where the centerline of the driveway intersects the curb, or edge or pavement where no curb exists. 
                  (2)  Although paved driveway widths may be less than 24 feet, the improved access point to the property shall not be less than 24-feet wide when the driveway crosses an open ditch to access the roadway. 
                  (3)  Driveways 40-feet wide shall be approved only where long wheel base vehicles are to be a majority of the traffic to a facility. 
                  (e)  Sight distance along roadway. 
                  (1)  All driveways shall be so located, designed and constructed so that vehicle operators using them will have adequate sight distance in both directions along the road. 
                  (2)  All exit driveways or driveway lanes shall have the minimum sight distance in subsection (f) of this section measured in each direction. The planning director may require longer distances based on the site specific road conditions to ensure safety. 
                  (f)  Driveway sight distance. 

                   
                  (g)  Number of driveways.

                  a.  One, two-way drive on main road and one, two-way driveway on the secondary road totaling two, two-way driveways. Driveways are to be located as far as practical from the intersection. 
                  b.  Two, one-way driveways may be substituted for one, two-way drive. 
                  (7)  Multiple businesses on commercial tracts. 
                  a.  Up to 300 linear feet of frontage: one, two-way drive or two, one-way drives. 
                  b.  Frontages between 300 and 1,000 linear feet: two, two-way drives.

                  e.  Frontages of over 3,000 linear feet: driveways as determined by the planning director on a case-by-case basis. 
                  (8)  Joint driveways. 
                  a.  A joint driveway may be authorized when requested by two applicants owning adjacent property or when required by the county as part of a subdivision review. 
                  b.  Joint driveways are required when one of the following is present: 
                  1.  Commercial and industrial lots with less than 300 feet of right-of-way frontage; and 
                  2.  Fronts a roadway with more than 2,000 trips per day. 
                  (h)  Driveway design. 
                  (1)  General conditions. Where turnouts and driveways access state or federal roads and permits are required by the state department of transportation, a copy of such permit shall be supplied to the county by the applicant. 
                  (2)  Angle. 
                  a.  The angle of one-way driveways with the roadway shall be as close to 90 degrees as possible. 
                  b.  Driveways used for two-way operation shall intersect the roadway at an angle as near 90 degrees as possible. 
                  c.  If joined with another two-way driveway conditions shall be that no vehicle will have to make a deflection of greater than 90 degrees when entering or leaving the property. 
                  (3)  Driveway radii. Curb cut radius shall be at least 20 feet and not greater than 35 feet for commercial developments. For industrial developments curb cut radius shall be at least 25 feet and not greater than 40 feet. 
                  (4)  Grade. For nonresidential driveways, the grade of the driveway shall slope downward and away from the road surface at the rate not less than 2.0 percent or more than 6.25 percent out to the road ditch line, but in no case less than 18 feet from the edge of the pavement. Where the roadway pavement is super-elevated and the upper shoulder is graded to the slope of the pavement, the grade of the driveway shall conform to the slope of the shoulder to a point 12 feet from the edge of the pavement. However, beyond this 12-foot line the driveway and islands shall be designed to rollover grade so that water from this area will not flow onto the roadway shoulder or pavement. In some cases it may not be feasible to continue the slope of the pavement upward with the super elevation. In such cases the planning director shall make this determination during his inspection and review of the permit request and will revise the plans submitted accordingly, as well as provide adequate documentation as to why this variance was made in this particular instance. Through the remaining right-of-way width the grade of the driveways shall not be greater than 6.25 percent, positive or negative. In areas where the right-of-way exists, the elevation of the driveway at the right-of-way line shall not be more than one foot higher or lower than the edge of the road at the point opposite that point on the driveway unless specifically waived by the planning director and documented on the plan as to why the waiver was justified. 
                  (5)  Driveway widths. Driveway width shall be at least 15 feet for one-way driveways and at least 24 feet for two-way driveways. Curb cuts shall not be greater than 40 feet. 
                  (6)  Acceleration/deceleration lane requirements. 
                  a.  The appropriate deceleration lane (commercial or industrial uses) shall be constructed. Acceleration lanes shall also be required where it is determined by the planning director that they are needed because of the nature of the business or type traffic in question. Such lanes shall be constructed at no cost to the county. The right-of-way for such lanes and for future provision of acceleration lanes shall be dedicated to the county by the applicant. 
                  b.  The pavement section for the lanes shall match that of the main road or be a lesser design if approved by the planning director. In areas where there will remain an open road side ditch, curb and gutter will not generally be required along the longitudinal part of the deceleration/acceleration lanes, but shall be provided on the radii, medians, etc., in order to prevent pot holes in the radius of the drive. 
                  c.  Deceleration lanes shall be required of all developments that have at least one of the following criteria present: 
                  1.  Frontage road has more than 10,000 ADTs; 
                  2.  Frontage road has speed limit of 45 miles per hour or greater; 
                  3.  The total development when built out will generate more than 2,000 ADTs; and 
                  4.  Sight distance at driveway is less than the minimums described in subsection (e) of this section. 
                  (i)  Island locations, dimensions, development and delineation. 
                  (1)  Island location. Any two driveway's connection with a highway shall be separated by an island area. The side of the island adjacent to the highway travel lane shall be located at the existing curbline if any. Otherwise the side of the island shall be ten or more feet from the edge of the pavement as specified by the county. If approved by the planning director the distance between the side of the island and the edge of the pavement may be less than ten feet. 
                  (2)  Unpaved islands. The area or island between the uncurbed driveways serving roadside enterprises shall remain unpaved unless a sidewalk is required of sufficient width to cover the entire island. 
                  (3)  Open ditch islands. Where a roadside ditch exists, providing an acceptable obstacle to prevent vehicular traffic over the island, the applicant may request to retain the condition. If approved by the county, delineation of the driveway and roadway will not be required. However, an acceptable barrier consisting of six or eight vertical concrete curb, six inches or more in height which shall circumscribe those islands installed between and on either side of the driveways. 
                  (j)  Encroachment upon intersection design. No portion of a driveway other than a normal radius shall enter the right-of-way at a point at distances of less than 25 feet from the point of intersection of the right-of-way lines

                  Sec. 26-226. - General requirements for road construction. 
                  (a)  Disturbed area shall be kept to a minimum during road construction; the smallest practical area shall be disturbed at any one time. Erosion control measures must be installed prior to or concurrent with the land disturbing activity. Suitable vegetative cover or mulch shall be applied immediately following construction to all disturbed areas and rights-of-way. Mass grading of subdivision roads and lots together is prohibited. 
                  (b)  Permanent drainage structures shall be designed for anticipated runoff of a 24-hour, 25-year storm and installed in the initial phase of road construction. These structures shall be protected and kept open to control runoff. These structures must be grouted, clean, undamaged and in proper working order prior to the issuance of a final approval. 
                  (c)  All streets shall have shoulders of no less than nine feet in width, clear of all obstruction other than breakaway posts, with a slope of no greater than 1.25 inches per foot and no less than 0.75 inch per foot. 
                  (d)  All finished driveways entering on a paved road must be hard surfaced (asphalt or concrete) from the edge of pavement to not less than 30 feet or the edge of the ROW whichever is greater. (Some subdivision classes require paved drives) The driveway must be designed to divert water into the roadside ditches or onto areas other than the road. This item will be inspected at or before the final inspection for the house and a certificate of occupancy will not be issued if this requirement is not met. 
                  (e)  All residential subdivision entrances serving 25 lots or more shall have a deceleration lane. The lane length shall be determined by the design engineer using accepted standards. (See section 26-544, the county standard details.) A 50-foot taper shall be provided to serve as an acceleration lane. The planning commission may accept or increase the length depending on local conditions. On state rights-of-way the need and length shall be determined by the state DOT. 
                  (f)  The proposed county right-of-way shall be cleared the full required width of all trees, bushes, debris and other materials. 
                  (g)  No signs, structures, wells, or other items, except mail boxes, are allowed on the county right-of-way. 
                  (h)  Prior to preliminary review, the centerline of the proposed roads shall be staked at 50-foot intervals and restaked for inspection prior to application of base course.

                  Sec. 26-227. - Exemption from curb and gutter requirement. 
                  In a residential subdivision where all lot sizes are larger than one acre the use of curb and gutter to county standards shall be at the option of the developer. In class IV and class V subdivisions, a variance to the curb and gutter requirement may be applied for. An engineer's technical report demonstrating the hydrological and environmental benefits to the removal of curb and gutter in the development must be included with the application. The design and report should also incorporate the items listed in section 26-567 when possible.

                  The purpose of a variance is to provide relief when a strict application of this chapter would impose unusual practical difficulties or unnecessary physical hardships on the applicant. Practical difficulties and unnecessary hardship may result from the size, shape or dimensions of a site or the location of existing structure thereon; from geographic, topographic, or other conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity. No variance shall be granted to allow the use of property for a purpose not authorized or in a manner not authorized by this chapter. No variance may be granted for a self-imposed hardship.

                  1.  For the purpose of this chapter, the area of Lumpkin County, Georgia, is hereby divided into the character areas listed below and described on the character area Map of Lumpkin County. There are specific development requirements for new development proposed in each character area based upon the land use category of the proposed development as described in section 27-40 et seq. of this chapter. Every lawful land use fits into a land use category, and no otherwise lawful land use is prohibited in any character area. The development requirements are intended to reduce potential conflicts between adjacent land uses by establishing buffers between uses and subjecting certain uses to additional scrutiny and approvals because of the scale of their potential impacts on neighboring and nearby land uses. 
                  2.  Character areas: 
                  A.  Agricultural preservation—Agricultural preservation areas are intended for uses such as conservation, farming, commercial agricultural uses, and very low-density large lot residential development. "Conventional" subdivision development is discouraged in this character area, and maintaining distance between active agricultural uses and new residential uses or other incompatible uses is emphasized. 
                  B.  Rural places—Rural places is intended for development as rural residential communities connected to the agricultural, economic, environmental, and aesthetic features of the rural and natural landscape through practices such as clustering development at farmsteads and large lot homesteads, crossroad hamlets, or within large lot conservation and master planned developments. 
                  C.  Residential growth area—Residential growth areas are intended for conventional subdivisions and commercial nodes. Development in this area with be characterized by smaller lot sizes and a greater variety of housing types. 
                  D.  Industrial— areas are intended for uses that are likely to have negative impacts on neighboring properties or the surrounding area, and particularly those uses that could be potentially dangerous to health, safety, or general welfare if located near residential development. 
                  E.  Neighborhood village centers—Neighborhood village centers are intended for small-scale commercial uses designed to serve daily local needs of the surrounding area. These uses will generally be retail or service oriented and be located in buildings between 3,000 and 6,000 square feet, but not more than 30,000 square feet. 
                  F.  Community village centers—Community village centers are intended for commercial, office, and mixed-use developments that serve a region or a larger area than the immediate neighborhood. 
                  G.  Commerce Corridor — Commerce corridors are intended for commercial, industrial, and other employment uses that do not have significant impacts on the environment or on nearby properties. Examples of these uses include office and business parks, large scale commercial sites, office-warehouse centers, distribution/service facilities, industrial sites, high-technology and research uses, wholesaling companies, and similar businesses. Because of the intensity of use and its potential relationship to residential uses, intensive industrial uses are discouraged in this character area. 
                  H.  Gateway Corridor—Gateway corridors are intended large-scale commercial, office, technology, and distribution uses along major roadways and transportation corridors. 
                  3.  No land shall be developed within a particular character area unless the property is compatible with the requirements outlined within this chapter. 
                  4.  For the purposes of this restriction, the term "within" shall mean that character area in which the largest percentage of the relevant parcel lies.

                  All manufactured homes must pass a minimum of three inspections before a certificate of occupancy is issued and connection of permanent power is approved. 
                  (1)  The first two inspections are for erosion control, footings, foundation, anchors and tie downs. These items must be installed according to manufacturer's instructions or the rules and regulations for manufactured homes published by the State Safety Fire Commissioner on new manufactured homes.

                  (4)  If an inspection fails for any reason including improper work or failure to follow guidelines or regulations, or because of lack of access for the inspector or because of the lack of or improperly installed erosion control, a reinspection fee in the amount set forth in the County Fee Schedule in section 18-19 will be assessed and must be paid prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy and connection of permanent power. 
                  (5)  A copy of the septic permit indicating the system as installed is approved by the health department must be provided prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

                  Sec. 30-12. - Variances. 
                  The purpose of a variance is to provide relief when a strict application of these regulations would impose unusual practical difficulties or unnecessary physical hardships on the applicant. Practical difficulties and unnecessary hardship may result from the size, shape, location or dimensions of a site or structure. 
                  A variance will not be granted for a self-imposed hardship. 
                  (1)  Reasonable conditions may be imposed in connection with a variance as deemed necessary to protect the best interest of the surrounding property or neighborhood, and otherwise secure the purpose and requirements of these regulations.

                  Editor's note— Res. No. 2008-28, §§ I—XIII, exhs. A—C, adopted June 19, 2008, amended Art. II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. II, §§ 38-23—38-37, pertained to drugs and alcohol, and derived from Res. No. 2006-69, exh. A, adopted Nov. 16, 2006. 

                  Sec. 38-23. - Policy statement. 
                  It is the position of the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners that alcohol and controlled substance abuse is a significant health problem in the United States today. The costs involved with this problem include human costs, such as lost jobs, morale problems, injuries, illnesses, and deaths, as well as economic costs, such as property damage, absenteeism, tardiness, lost productivity, increased health insurance costs, and the costs involved in replacing and retraining new employees. Further, in professions that serve the public, alcohol and substance abuse represents a real danger to the health and safety not only of the employees themselves, but also of the constituents served by those employees. 
                  It is the objective of the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners to provide safe and effective public service. To meet this objective, the problem of alcohol and controlled substance abuse must be identified, confirmed and defeated. In order to achieve this, the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners has developed a comprehensive alcohol and controlled substance abuse policy. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-28, § I, 6-19-2008; Res. No. 2012-48, exh. A, 8-21-2012) 
                  Sec. 38-24. - Definitions. 
                  Within this substance abuse policy, and on any accompanying forms, the following terms shall have the meanings associated therewith: 
                  Controlled substance shall have the meaning and include the substances defined as "controlled substances" in the Georgia Controlled Substances Act, O.C.G.A. §§ 16-13-20 and 16-12-21(4) as said Act shall appear from time to time. 
                  Safety sensitive position shall be those positions where inattention to duty or errors in judgment by the employee or applicant while on duty will have the potential for significant risk of physical harm to the employee, other employees or the general public. A list of such positions is attached as Exhibit C. 
                  Confirmed positive result. Whenever an initial test for drugs or alcohol is found to be positive, the laboratory will carry out additional tests pursuant to laboratory testing guidelines to confirm that the initial positive indication was correct. If the second procedure also indicates the presence of drugs or alcohol, the test result will be considered a confirmed positive result. 
                  Medical review officer shall mean a properly licensed physician who reviews and interprets the results of drug tests and evaluates those results together with medical history and any other relevant biomedical information to confirm positive results. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-28, § II, 6-19-2008; Res. No. 2012-48, exh. A, 8-21-2012) 
                  Editor's note— Exhibit C, referenced above, is set out at the end of this article. 
                  Sec. 38-25. - Drug and alcohol use prohibited. 
                  Alcohol and controlled substance use by employees during assigned working hours, in all county-owned, operated, leased or maintained buildings or on county-owned, operated, leased or maintained grounds, or otherwise while on official business shall be prohibited. This shall include the use or possession of controlled substances, the abuse of prescription medications, the possession of prescription medications by anyone other than the person for whom the medication was prescribed (except as required by official duty), and the use or abuse of alcohol. This prohibition (and the procedures set forth below) is in addition to any other drug and alcohol policy, including any policies or programs required by federal or state law. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-28, § III, 6-19-2008; Res. No. 2012-48, exh. A, 8-21-2012) 
                  Sec. 38-26. - Types of testing to be implemented. 
                  (a)  Pre-employment testing: Because substance abuse is not easily detectible in an applicant without the provision of a drug and alcohol screening, and because the safety and health of employees and the health and safety of citizens depend upon a workforce free from drug and alcohol abuse, all job applicants being considered for employment in positions for which pre-employment drug and/or alcohol screening is allowed by law, shall be required to pass a drug and/or alcohol screening test prior to being hired. All job applicants shall be informed in advance that such testing shall be required, and postings for all jobs shall include a notice of this testing requirement. Pre-employment testing shall take place only after an offer of employment has been made but before employment actually commences. 
                  (b)  Random and periodic drug testing: Employees in all positions designated as safety sensitive, involved in drug interdiction, or having unsupervised access to prisoners or contraband shall be required to submit to a drug and alcohol screening test at random or on a periodic basis from time to time as determined by the department head and the human resources director. 
                  (c)  Drug and/or alcohol screening test based on reasonable suspicion: 
                  (1)  Any employee shall be required to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that such employee is under the influence or effects of drugs and/or alcohol immediately before, during or immediately after assigned working hours or while otherwise on duty or in control of government property. 
                  (2)  Reasonable suspicion means a reasonable belief based on specific objective and articulable facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts in light of experience. Situations that may give rise to a conclusion that an employee is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol include, but are not limited to, the following: 
                  a.  An employee is involved in a physical or verbal altercation on the job. 
                  b.  An employee has an excessive number of incidents or accidents on the job. 
                  c.  An employee exhibits unusual behavior such as slurred speech or unsteady walking or movement on the job. 
                  d.  An employee has an odor of alcohol or marijuana on their person on the job. 
                  e.  An employee is in possession of alcohol, drugs, or drug paraphernalia on the job. 
                  f.  An employee is observed using illegal drugs or alcohol or has exhibited the symptoms and manifestations of being impaired due to alcohol or drug use. 
                  g.  An employee has caused or contributed to an accident while on the job. 
                  (3)  In the event a supervisor determines that reasonable suspicion exists that an employee is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, the supervisor shall immediately report the incident to his/her immediate supervisor or department head and shall complete the form entitled observation checklist (Exhibit A). 
                  (4)  The determination of whether reasonable suspicion exists shall be made by the department head or, in his/her absence, by the highest-ranking supervisory staff on-duty at the time. 
                  (5)  Following the determination that reasonable suspicion exists, the facts underlying the determination of reasonable suspicion shall be disclosed to the employee at the time the demand to submit to testing is made. The employee shall be transported to and from the testing site by the employee's supervisor or a designee. Following the testing procedure, the person transporting the employee shall make appropriate arrangements to transport the employee home. 
                  (6)  Supervisors shall be required to document in writing, by the next working day, the specific facts, symptoms or observations that formed the basis for their determination that reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the testing of an employee. All documents created in connection with the determination of reasonable suspicion shall be forwarded to the human resources director and/or county manager. 
                  (d)  Testing after accidents or injury: An employee in a safety sensitive position, an employee involved in the interdiction of illegal drugs, or an employee who, in his/her job duties, is given unsupervised custody of prisoners or contraband shall be subject to a drug and alcohol test conducted when, while on duty or just prior to going on duty: 
                  (1)  The employee is operating a vehicle and/or equipment causing significant damage or any bodily injury; or 
                  (2)  The employee is involved in a fatality; or 
                  (3)  The employee is cited with a traffic violation; or 
                  (4)  The employee sustains a work-related injury requiring medical treatment beyond first aid. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-28, § IV, 6-19-2008; Res. No. 2012-48, exh. A, 8-21-2012) 
                  Editor's note— Exhibit A, referenced above, is set out at the end of this article. 
                  Sec. 38-27. - Prescription drug use. 
                  (a)  Any employees using prescription medication while on the job shall do so in strict accordance with medical directions. It is the employee's responsibility to notify the prescribing physician of the duties required by the employee's position and to ensure the physician approves the use of the prescription medication while the employee is performing his/her duties. 
                  (b)  The abuse and/or inappropriate use of legally prescribed drugs, including the performance of duties when the employee knows or should know that he or she is potentially impaired due to prescription drug use, shall be prohibited and shall be deemed a violation of this policy. Job performance or attendance deficiencies resulting from use shall be cause for disciplinary action up to and including termination. If any employee's behavior or job performance gives rise to a reasonable suspicion that the employee is abusing or inappropriately using prescription medication, the employee may be required to submit to drug testing and to take leave until such time as the employee is cleared to return to work by the employee's physician, the medical review officer, and the human resources director. 
                  (c)  Employees and job applicants shall at the time of testing provide a list of those prescriptions and over-the-counter medications the employee recently has used. The list of medications shall be kept confidential until there has been a test result. The list of medications shall be disclosed only to the medical review officer who will determine whether the positive result was due to the lawful use of any of the listed medications. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-28, § V, 6-19-2008; Res. No. 2012-48, exh. A, 8-21-2012) 
                  Sec. 38-28. - Consent. 
                  Before a drug and alcohol test is administered, employees and job applicants will be asked to sign a consent form (Exhibit B) authorizing the test and permitting release of test results to the employer and the medical review officer. The consent form shall provide a space for employees and job applicants to acknowledge that they have been notified of the requirements of this policy. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-28, § VI, 6-19-2008) 
                  Editor's note— Exhibit B, referenced above, is set out at the end of this article. 
                  Sec. 38-29. - Refusal to consent 
                  (a)  Job applicants: Any applicant for a position for which pre-employment drug and/or alcohol screening is permitted by law who refuses to consent to a drug and/or alcohol test shall be denied employment, and any conditional offer of employment shall immediately be rescinded. 
                  (b)  Employees: Any employee who refuses to sign the required consent form or to submit to a drug and/or alcohol test as required shall be deemed to have violated this policy. 
                  (c)  No show: Employees who fail to appear at the designated collection site to submit to a required drug and/or alcohol test when so directed shall be deemed to have refused to submit to the test shall be deemed to have violated this policy. A "no show" shall include any attempt to adulterate a test sample or otherwise frustrate, impair, or otherwise impede the testing process. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-28, § VII, 6-19-2008) 
                  Sec. 38-30. - Testing laboratory guidelines 
                  (a)  All testing procedures shall be administered and accounted for by an approved laboratory and/or medical facility operating in compliance with the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) or College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines. 
                  (b)  Urine samples shall be provided in a private restroom stall or similar enclosure so that employees and applicants may not be viewed while providing the sample, unless circumstances require monitored testing. Outer garments, bags, briefcases, purses, or other containers will not be permitted into the test area. The water in the commode shall be colored with dye to protect against dilution of test samples. 
                  If the drug and/or alcohol test is to be conducted using a specimen other than urine (e.g. hair, saliva, blood, etc.), the sample shall be collected in a manner consistent with the privacy of the employee and the need to minimize the possibility of adulteration and/or mislabeling of the sample. 
                  (c)  Whenever an initial test for drugs and alcohol is found to be positive, the laboratory will then carry out additional tests pursuant to laboratory testing guidelines to confirm that the initial positive indication was correct. If the second procedure also indicates the presence of drugs or alcohol, the test result is considered a confirmed positive result. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-28, § VIII, 6-19-2008) 
                  Sec. 38-31. - Confidentiality of test results. 
                  To the extent allowed by law, all information from an employee's or job applicant's drug and alcohol screening shall be confidential and only available to the medical review officer, human resources director and those with a need to know at the discretion of the human resources director. Disclosure of test results to any other person, agency, or organization shall be prohibited unless written authorization is obtained from the employee or job applicant. In any case, the results of an initial positive drug or alcohol test shall not be released until the results are confirmed. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-28, § IX, 6-19-2008) 
                  Sec. 38-32. - Violations of this policy. 
                  Any violation of this policy shall be handled in a manner consistent with disciplinary procedures. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-28, § X, 6-19-2008) 
                  Sec. 38-33. - Employee assistance program. 
                  Referrals to an employee assistance program or rehabilitation program shall be made in accordance with established employee assistance policies, if any. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-28, § XI, 6-19-2008) 
                  Sec. 38-34. - Drug and alcohol convictions. 
                  Consistent with the Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, employees shall report to his or her department head within five working days any arrest or conviction made under a criminal drug or alcohol law and any charge made under a drug or alcohol law for which conviction could cause the loss of driving privileges. The department head shall then investigate and make appropriate recommendations to the human resources director. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-28, § XII, 6-19-2008) 
                  Sec. 38-35. - Return to duty. 
                  Any employee who tests positive on a drug or alcohol test will be immediately placed on suspension without pay until such time as a determination of appropriate disciplinary action is made. The suspension without pay shall be for a period of not less than one nor more than ten working days for any employee who is non-exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. For employees exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act, such suspension shall be for a period of not less than one day nor more than two whole work weeks, providing that the period of suspension coincides with the employee's official work week. 
                  Any employee who tests positive for the presence of illegal drugs or alcohol above the minimum thresholds set forth in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended, will be referred for evaluation by a substance abuse professional (SAP) at the expense of the employee. A substance abuse professional is a licensed physician or certified psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional, or addiction counselor certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission or by the International Certification Reciprocity Consortium/Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse. 
                  Assessment by a SAP, does not shield an employee from disciplinary action or guarantee employment or reinstatement. The civil service manual should be consulted to determine the penalty for performance-based infractions and violation of policy provisions. 
                  If an employee is allowed to return to duty, he/she must properly follow the rehabilitation program prescribed by the SAP, the employee must have negative return to duty drug and alcohol tests, and be subject to unannounced follow-up testing for a minimum period of one year. Unannounced follow-up testing shall be at the sole discretion of the employer and shall be at any time. The cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid directly by the employee or his/her insurance provider. The cost of follow-up testing will be borne by the employee. Employee will be allowed to take accumulated sick leave and annual leave to participate in the prescribed rehabilitation program.

                  I hereby consent to submit to urinalysis and/or other tests as shall be determined by the Human Resources Director in the selection process of applicants for employment, for the purpose of determining the drug content thereof. 
                  I hereby acknowledge that I have been notified of the requirements of the Lumpkin County Substance Abuse Policy. 
                  I agree that Corporate Care and/or Chestatee Regional Hospital personnel may collect the specimens for these tests and may test them or forward them to a testing laboratory designated by the Human Resources Director for analysis. 
                  I further agree to and hereby authorize the release of the results of said tests to the Human Resources Director or his or her designee. 
                  I understand that it is the current use of illegal drugs that prohibits me from being considered for employment with Lumpkin County. 
                  I further agree to hold harmless the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners and its agents (including the above named physician or clinic) from any liability arising in whole or in part, out of collection of specimens, testing, and use of the information from said testings in connection with consideration of my application of employment.

                  Editor's note— Res. No. 2012-62, exhs. A, B, adopted Nov. 20, 2012, added provisions that were not specifically amendatory. At the editor's discretion, said provisions were included as §§ 38-51—38-77, 38-86, 38-87. 

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 38-51. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer equipment at Lumpkin County. These policies and procedures are in place to protect the employee and Lumpkin County. Inappropriate use exposes Lumpkin County to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems, services and legal issues.

                  Sec. 38-52. - Policy. 
                  Certain Lumpkin County employees may be provided Internet access to assist them in performance of their jobs. The computer system belongs to Lumpkin County, acting by and through its duly elected board of commissioners, and may only be used for county business purposes. The Internet can be a valuable source of information and research. In addition, e-mail can provide an excellent means of communicating with other employees, customers, citizens, outside vendors and other businesses. Use of the internet, however, must be tempered with common sense and good judgment. If you abuse your right to use the Internet, this privilege may be revoked. In addition, you may be subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination, civil and/or criminal liability. All information on county computers and systems is considered county property. Deleting, altering or sharing confidential or any other information upon termination is a violation of state law and will be investigated and prosecuted.

                  Sec. 38-53. - No expectation of privacy. 
                  The computers and the computer accounts given to county employees are to assist them in the performance of their jobs. Employees do not have an expectation of privacy in anything they create, store, send or receive on the computer system. The computer system belongs to the county and may be used for county business purposes only. There shall be no use of the county system for personal or private use. 
                  (Res. No. 2012-62, exh. A, 11-20-2012) 
                  Sec. 38-54. - No privacy in communications. 
                  Employees should never consider electronic communications to be either private or secure. E-mail may be stored indefinitely on any number of computers, including that of the recipient. Copies of your messages may be forwarded to others either electronically or on paper. In addition, e-mail sent to non-existent or incorrect user names may be delivered to persons that you never intended. 
                  Users of the email system are responsible for managing e-mail messages, as well as other electronic documents according to the county and state record retention policy and schedule (O.C.G.A. § 50-18-90). It is the responsibility of the county e-mail sender and county e-mail recipients to retain messages, as well as any attachments, for the approved retention period. Email messages are subject to Georgia's Open Records Act (O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70).

                  These guidelines set the standards for appropriate behavior of county employees when accessing the Internet using government resources. Remember the county name goes with you as an electronic signature wherever you go on the internet. County employees must exercise great care to protect the county reputation and ability to conduct business in all Internet activities. Activities of county Internet users are logged, including visits to inappropriate site (erotica, hate groups, etc.), and reported to management as necessary.

                  The internet, blogs, Twitter, Web, social networking sites (such as Facebook, etc.) and any other medium of electronic communication shall not be used in a manner that is detrimental to the mission and function of Lumpkin County. Any matter that brings individual employees or any department into disrepute has the corresponding effect of reducing public confidence and trust in Lumpkin County Government, thus impeding our ability to work and serve the public. 
                  While employees have the right to use personal/social networking pages or sites, as employees of Lumpkin County they are public servants held to a higher standard than the general public with regard to standards of conduct and ethics.

                  Employees who utilize social networking sites, blogs, Facebook, Twitter or other mediums of electronic communication in their off-duty time shall maintain an appropriate level of professionalism and appropriate conduct so as not to broadcast in a manner which brings discredit to Lumpkin County Government. 
                  Employees are prohibited from using their title as well as any reference to Lumpkin County in any correspondence, to include e-mails, postings, blogs, Twitter, and social network sites such as Facebook, unless the communication is of an official nature. This prohibition includes signature lines in personal email accounts. 
                  All candidates seeking employment with Lumpkin County shall be required to complete an affidavit indicating any participation in any social networking sites. Networking sites shall be listed by name. The candidate shall provide access to the networking site as part of any background investigation. 
                  Employees who are the subject of an administrative investigation may be ordered to provide access to his or her social networking site(s) when the investigation is directly, narrowly, and specifically related to the employee's performance or ability to perform the required duties of his or her job description.

                  • Visiting inappropriate web sites (erotica, hate groups, etc.).

                  Failure to comply with these guidelines may be brought to the attention of management for appropriate action, which may result in loss of Internet privileges or disciplinary action, including termination or employment. Violations of applicable laws or regulations (e.g. Computer Security Act, export control laws, copyright laws, etc.) could result in criminal or civil prosecution.

The Internet is a worldwide network of computers that contains millions of pages of information. Users are cautioned that many of these pages include offensive, sexually explicit and inappropriate material. In general, it is difficult to avoid at least some contact with this material while using the Internet. Even innocent search requests may lead to sites with highly offensive content. In addition, you may receive e-mail containing offensive material. E-mail or pop-ups containing offensive material received on county computers shall be immediately reported to the department head or elected official who shall maintain a log of such occurrences. The employee should block these offensive e-mail senders and send to "Junk Mail" folder. Users accessing the Internet do so at their own risk.

These acts include, but are not limited to, sending mass mailings or chain letters, spending excessive amounts of time on the Internet, playing games, engaging in online chat groups, printing multiple copies of documents, or otherwise creating unnecessary network traffic. Because audio, video and picture files require significant storage space, files of this sort may not be downloaded unless they are business related.

Developers are required to purchase signs at their own expense; signs must be approved as to design and color, and must be installed to county specifications. Lumpkin County will purchase and install street name signs and traffic control (STOP) signs in accordance with the fee schedule in effect at the time of installation. 
                  (d)  Lumpkin County road sign regulations provide that:

The county will normally install the sign within one week of delivery from the manufacturer; however installation will be subject to weather and other department priorities. all sign installations shall be recorded by the county road department and locations maintained in the county GIS database. 
                  (f)  Signs damaged or stolen after installation will not be replaced until the cost of the replacement has been paid to the county. Replacement cost of the sign will be the county cost of the sign plus 20 percent, which will include the cost of the installation. 
                  (g)  For cost, see below for the Schedule of Costs: 
                  SCHEDULE OF COSTS  STREET NAME SIGN AND STOP SIGN COST  February 21; 2012

                  Total cost: $110.00 to purchase and install a street sign. 
                  Stop Signs: 
                  Total Cost: $115.00 to purchase and install a stop sign. 
                  This schedule of costs is subject to change based on the cost of materials, labor and administrative expenses. All such changes may be implemented by the public works director with the advice and consent of the finance director and planning director. 
                  No orders will be accepted unless all information is provided (name of street, location of sign, etc.) accompanied by sufficient funds to provide payment in full. No order will be taken for future delivery which could result in county having to warehouse, store or protect goods for a period greater than 30 days after receipt of the signs and necessary installation materials.

Acceptable reasons for changing road names are: 
                  (1)  To correct spelling; 
                  (2)  To eliminate duplication (in spelling or sound);

                  This article shall not apply to the purchase or sale of used motor vehicles, including motorcycles and motor driven cycles, as defined in the Georgia Vehicle Code, nor shall it apply to businesses or charitable organizations that accept donated goods for resale, nor shall it apply to the sale or purchase of aluminum cans.

                  Sec. 44-33. - Electronic reporting of transactions. 
                  The sheriff's office shall enter into a contract for service and maintain its contract for service with LeadsOnline, or a similar entity as designated by the sheriff, in order to enhance its investigative services to protect pawnbrokers, secondhand dealers, secondary metals recyclers, and members of the general public. In the event of a change to its electronic reporting system, the sheriff or his designee will notify all impacted licensees of the change within a reasonable time prior to such change. 
                  Every pawnbroker, secondhand dealer and secondary metals recycler shall operate and maintain a computer system with internet access and photographic or video capability sufficient for the electronic reporting requirements described in this article. Any failure or malfunction of such equipment on the part of the licensee shall not exempt the licensee from the recording/reporting requirements outlined in section 44-114 of this article. The licensee shall immediately notify the sheriff's office of any such failure or malfunction, and shall have such resolved as soon as practicable. Failure by the licensee to resolve any failure or malfunction of equipment in a reasonable amount of time will lead to license revocation proceedings under section 44-138 of this article. 
                  (Res. No. 2014-39, exh. A, 8-9-2014) 
                  Sec. 44-34. - Record of transactions. 
                  Throughout the term of the license, every pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler shall report/upload to LeadsOnline, or the county's current electronic reporting system, the below listed information for each and every transaction conducted during each day they were open for business by the end of that business day. All information shall be recorded in the English language. 
                  A transaction shall consist of all articles brought in to a pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn by an individual (pawner/seller) at the same time and date, and includes the sale of non-junk/scrap articles by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer to another person. Non-junk/scrap articles purchased by a pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler from another business shall not be considered to be transactions for the purposes of this section, and are exempt from the reporting requirements of this section, and are also exempt from the waiting period established under section 44-38. Articles brought in to a pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn at different times on the same date by the same person shall be considered as separate transactions, regardless of how short the difference in time is between those transactions. Separate transactions, either from the same person or different persons, shall not be combined and reported collectively. 
                  (1)  Non-junk/scrap articles other than coins and paper money. 
                  a.  Purchases/receipts by licensees. 
                  i.  Reserved. 
                  ii.  All such articles sold, bartered, traded, pledged or pawned to a pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler by an individual (pawner/seller) during a transaction shall be associated with the person (pawner/seller) who brought the article(s) in. The licensee shall record/report the following information for each such transaction: 
                  1.  The name, current address and date of birth of the pawner/seller. 
                  2.  A digital photographic or scanned image of a photo ID card of the pawner/seller, sufficiently clear to allow the information on the ID to be read. The photo ID must be a currently valid (not expired) card issued by a government entity of the United States, and must include the pawner/seller's first and last name, current address, date of birth, and physical descriptors. 
                  3.  Reserved. 
                  4.  The date and time of the transaction. 
                  iii.  Descriptions/photographs of articles. 
                  1.  Individually identifiable articles: 
                  (a)  Each individually identifiable non-junk/scrap article brought in to a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during a single transaction shall be itemized separately. Pawnbroker or secondhand dealer licensees shall not lump such articles together (e.g., "five gold monogrammed rings"), but must provide a complete and thorough description of each item to include the following: 
                  (i)  Type of article. 
                  (ii)  Brand name/make/manufacturer (if applicable). 
                  (iii)  Model number (if applicable). 
                  (iv)  Serial number (if applicable). 
                  (v)  Color/finish. 
                  (vi)  Any other identifying marks, writing, engraving, etc. 
                  (b)  A digital photograph(s) shall be taken of each individually identifiable article, sufficiently detailed to allow reasonable identification of the article. The digital photograph(s) shall capture any identifying numbers, marks, writing, engraving, etc., or any other distinguishing characteristics. 
                  (c)  Each individually identifiable non-junk/scrap article brought into a secondary metals recycler shall maintain a legible description of all purchase transactions as outlined in O.C.G.A. § 10-1-353 and must include the following: 
                  (i)  Weight, quantity, or volume and a description of the type of regulated metal property purchased in a purchase transaction. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term "type of regulated metal property" shall include a physical description, such as aluminum cans, copper 12GA wire, galvanized tubing; 
                  (ii)  A digital photograph or photographs where a single photograph is not sufficient to show the regulated metal property in a reasonably clear manner. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term, "reasonably clear manner" shall include images that will accurately reflect the detailed transaction recorded by the secondary metals recycler. 
                  (iii)  Reserved. 
                  (2)  Non-individually identifiable articles: 
                  (a)  Articles that cannot be distinguished from any other similar articles may be described in groups of similar types of articles, but only within the same transaction made by the same seller/pawner. Licensees shall provide reasonable descriptions of the number and types of items within each group to enable the sheriff's office to determine if they may have been stolen during a particular crime. Example: an individual pawner/seller brings in a video game controller, five video game discs, and numerous items of jewelry. The licensee would first of all have to individually itemize and photograph the video game controller as outlined in "Individually identifiable articles" above, as it would be a serially-numbered item. As for the remaining items, the licensee shall not list them as "Miscellaneous video games and jewelry." Instead, the licensee shall describe them as follows: "Five video game discs to include the following titles...." and "Miscellaneous jewelry to include two yellow gold necklaces, one silver necklace, two pairs of silver earrings, one women's yellow, gold ring, one women's white gold diamond ring and two silver bracelets." 
                  (b)  A digital photograph(s) shall be taken of each group of similar types of articles within each transaction made by the same seller/pawner. The articles may be photographed together as a group, but each individual article shall be visible in the photograph. For example, given the circumstances outlined in subsection (a) above, the five video game discs would be photographed together as a group side-by-side (not stacked on top of each other), and the jewelry items would be photographed together as a group with each item laid out so as to be individually viewable (not piled together in a heap). 
                  b.  Sales by licensees. 
                  i.  In order to facilitate the return of stolen items to their rightful owners, individually identifiable non-junk/scrap articles sold by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer to an individual shall be reported to LeadsOnline. Licensees shall individually itemize and describe each individually identifiable article so sold. 
                  ii.  Each individually identifiable non-junk/scrap article sold by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall be associated with the person to whom it was sold. The licensee shall record/report the following information for each such transaction: (1) The name and current address of the purchaser must be recorded/reported; a photographic image of a government-issued photo ID card is not necessary. (2) A digital photograph of non-junk/scrap articles sold by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer to an individual is not required. 
                  iii.  As there is no lawful basis for confiscating and returning property to the victim of a crime that cannot be individually identified as having been stolen from the victim, reporting the sale of non-individually identifiable articles by a licensee to LeadsOnline is not required. 
                  (2)  Junk/scrap articles. 
                  a.  Purchases by licensees. 
                  i.  Junk/scrap articles may be recorded/reported in bulk, but must specify the weight, type (e.g., steel, copper, aluminum, etc.) and form (e.g. sheet, pipe, wire, etc.) of the bulk material. Junk/scrap articles purchased by secondary metals recyclers shall adhere to the prescription provided in subsection (l)a.iii.(c). 
                  ii.  Each different type and form of junk/scrap bulk material brought in to a secondhand dealer by an individual for sale during a transaction shall be associated with the person who brought the material in. Licensees shall record/report the following information for each such transaction: 
                  (1)  The name, current address and date of birth of the pawner/seller. 
                  (2)  A photographic or scanned image of a photo ID card of the seller, sufficiently clear to allow the information on the ID to be read. The photo ID must be a currently valid (not expired) card issued by a government entity of the United States, and must include the pawner/seller's first and last name, current address, date of birth, and physical descriptors. 
                  (3)  If the seller is selling on behalf of a company or business, the name, address, and telephone number of such company or business shall also be recorded/reported. 
                  (4)  If the junk/scrap is brought by motor vehicle to a licensee for sale, the make, model, color, and license plate number of that vehicle shall be recorded/reported. 
                  (5)  The date and time of the transaction. 
                  (6)  A digital photograph or, if the licensee has a video system, video segment of each individual type and form of bulk material purchased by the licensee shall be linked to the record of that transaction. 
                  b.  Sales by licensees. 
                  i.  Licensees do not need to record/report any information pertaining to the sale of junk/scrap material. 
                  ii.  Reserved. 
                  (3)  Coins and paper money. 
                  a.  Purchases/receipts by licensees. 
                  i.  Coins have no distinguishing characteristics that separate them from other coins of the same mintage, and although paper money is serial numbered, those serial numbers are so seldom known by their last possessor that paper money is effectively indistinguishable from other paper money of the same denomination. Furthermore, unlike coins made of precious metals, paper money seldom carries any value significantly beyond the face value of the bill, and when stolen is usually used directly as cash and not sold to a currency dealer. Accordingly, coins or paper money brought in by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during a single transaction do not need to be itemized individually, but rather may be recorded/reported in bulk. 
                  ii.  Coins or paper money brought in to a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during a transaction shall be associated with the person (pawner/seller) who brought the article in. The licensee shall record/report the following information for each such transaction: 
                  1.  The name, current address and date of birth of the pawner/seller. 
                  2.  A digital photographic or scanned image of a photo ID card of the pawner/seller, sufficiently clear to allow the information on the ID to be read. The photo ID must be a currently valid (not expired) card issued by a government entity of the United States, and must include the pawner/seller's first and last name, current address, date of birth, and physical descriptors. 
                  3.  The date and time of the transaction. 
                  4.  The quantities and types of coins or paper money present. If coins are all of the same type, they shall be reported by either quantity or weight, and type (e.g., 5 Morgan silver dollars, 12 buffalo nickels, 5 lbs. of wheat pennies, etc.). If coins are from a collection, a description of the theme of the collection (e.g., Bicentennial coins, state quarters, etc.) along with the number of coins shall be provided. If coins represent an accumulation of disparate coins with no overall theme, a generic description of the type and quantity of coins shall be provided (e.g., approximately 200 U.S. coins of miscellaneous dates and denominations, approximately 100 foreign coins from various countries, etc.). Paper money shall be reported by quantity and type (e.g., 12 U.S. $5.00 silver certificates, etc.). 
                  iii.  As a photograph of coins or paper money conveys no more information than can be obtained from the written descriptions required by subsection (3)a.ii.(d) of this section, no photographs of coins or paper money are required. 
                  b.  Sales by licensees. 
                  i.  Licensees do not need to record/report any information pertaining to the sale of coins or paper money to other individuals or businesses. 
                  1.  In the event the electronic reporting system malfunctions or is otherwise not operational, the licensee shall, at all times during such malfunction or non-operation, be required to keep written records of any and all transactions made during the period of malfunction or non-operation, to include all information required by this section. These written records shall be reported/uploaded to LeadsOnline, or the county's current electronic reporting system, as soon as practicable after the electronic reporting system is functional. No such written records shall be erased, mutilated or changed. Written records shall be open and available for review upon request by any peace officer during regular business hours.

                  Sec. 44-35. - Pawnbrokers: issuance of signed receipt. 
                  Every pawnbroker shall, at the time of making any advancement or loan, deliver to the person pawning or pledging any property a receipt signed by him containing an accurate account and description, in the English language, of all the goods, articles or other things pawned or pledged, the amount of money, value or thing loaned thereon, the time of pledging the same, the rate of interest to be paid on such loan and the name and residence of the person making the pawn or pledge.

                  No secondhand dealer shall receive any article or thing by way of pledge or pawn, nor shall he loan or advance any sum of money on the security of any article or thing, unless he also happens to be separately licensed as a pawnbroker under this article, and complies with the specific requirements of sections 44-35 and 44-36 of this article.

                  Sec. 44-38. - Waiting periods. 
                  No articles received on deposit or pledge by any pawnbroker, shall be permitted to be redeemed or removed from the place of business of such pawnbroker for 48 hours after the delivery of the signed receipt required by section 44-35. No articles pawned or pledged shall be sold or disposed of by any pawnbroker within one year from the time the pawner or pledger shall make default in the payment of interest on the money so advanced by the pawnbroker, unless by the written consent of the pawner or pledger. 
                  No pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall expose for sale, or sell, trade or barter, or melt, crush/compact, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, any non-scrap/junk article that is individually identifiable within 30 days of the time of purchasing or receiving the same, nor until the same has been in or upon the premises where the same are offered, exposed, traded, bartered or sold, at least 30 days, unless the article consists primarily of precious metal(s). Due to fluctuations in the prices of precious metals and security concerns emanating from the accumulation of large quantities of precious metals, there shall be no waiting period for such articles, even if they are individually identifiable. 
                  There shall be no waiting period for scrap/junk, coins, paper money or other non-individually identifiable articles.

                  Sec. 44-39. - Prohibited transactions. 
                  No pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler, in the course of conducting his business, shall receive any articles for pawn, pledge, advancement of money, loan, resale, or personal use from: 
                  (1)  Minors who are under 18 years of age. 
                  (2)  Any person appearing to be intoxicated or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 
                  (3)  Any person known to the pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler to have been convicted of theft, residential burglary, burglary, home invasion, vehicular invasion, armed robbery, or robbery under the laws of the State of Georgia, or the equivalent laws of any other state. A peace officer may provide such criminal conviction information to a pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler, and a pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler may also access the LeadsOnline "No Buy" list prior to making a transaction to ensure that the prospective pawner/seller has not been convicted of any such crime. 
                  (4)  Any person bringing such articles to the premises in a shopping cart. 
                  (5)  Any person presenting a serial numbered non-scrap/junk article from which the serial number has been removed or obliterated. 
                  (6)  In the event that any of the above enumerated persons shall attempt to conduct a prohibited transaction, a representative of that business shall notify the sheriff's office of the incident while the person is still present in the business if safe to do so or otherwise as soon as the person has left the business.

                  Sec. 46-1. - Purpose and findings. 
                  The board of commissioners finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of non-commercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and to Lumpkin County's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. By enacting this chapter, the board of commissioners intends to: 
                  A.  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  B.  Further the objectives of the Lumpkin County Comprehensive Plan; 
                  C.  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare; 
                  D.  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
                  E.  Maintain and enhance the visual environment, and preserve the right of the citizens to enjoy Lumpkin County's scenic beauty; 
                  F.  Protect property values by minimizing possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  G.  Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  H.  Promote economic development; and 
                  I.  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

                  Sec. 46-2. - Applicability and severance. 
                  The regulations set forth below shall apply to all the unincorporated portions of the county. Within the unincorporated portions of the county no sign shall be erected or maintained unless it is in compliance with this chapter. In the event that a court should adjudge any part of this chapter a violation of the Georgia or United States Constitutions or any other provision of law, it is the specific intent of the board of commissioners that the offending provision or provisions be stricken from this chapter and the remainder of this chapter stay in effect to regulate signs on property within Lumpkin County.

                  (f)  This section shall apply with full force and effect regardless of the provisions of any order of the court in which the violator was convicted. This section should not be construed as an excuse for failure on the part of the violator to perform any cleanup ordered by the court, nor shall it be considered as a mitigating factor in any contempt action against a violator who has failed to obey the order of the court.

In a situation where the wellhead protection zone extends into the jurisdiction of another government entity, the governing authority of Lumpkin County will request that government to respect the protective features of this division. The area will consist of two zones identified as follows: 
                  (1)  The control zone . Within this zone, the Lumpkin County Water and Sewerage Authority shall control all activities so that there are minimal sources of potential pollution in the immediate vicinity of the wellhead. The control zone is all that area within a circle, the center of said wellhead and the radius of which is 157 feet. 
                  (2)  The management zone. Within this zone, certain potential pollution sources are prohibited and certain activities must be performed in accordance with the State of Georgia "Rules for Safe Drinking Water, Section 391-3-5.40 Wellhead Protection." The management zone may include inner- and outer-management zones, and contains the control zone and the wellhead as identified in the approved Georgia Wellhead Protection Plan for the Lumpkin County Water and Sewerage Authority.

                  Sec. 54-41. - Introduction; purpose and policy. 
                  (a)  This article sets forth uniform requirements for persons who cause wastewater to be discharged into the wastewater collection and treatment system of the county water and sewerage authority, and enables the authority to comply with all applicable state and federal laws, including but not limited to, the state Water Quality Act, the Clean Water Act, as amended, and the federal pretreatment regulations (40 CFR 403). 
                  (b)  The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the authority's wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
                  (2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the authority's wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
                  (3)  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the authority's wastewater system; and 
                  (4)  To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the authority's wastewater system. 
                  (c)  This article further provides for the regulation of persons who cause wastewater to be discharged into the authority's wastewater system through the issuance of permits to nondomestic users and through enforcement activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing customers' capacity will not be preempted, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems. 
                  (d)  This division shall apply to the residents of the county and to residents outside the county who reside in the service delivery area of the authority and to all users of the county water and sewerage authority water and wastewater systems, including persons outside the service delivery area, who are, by contract or agreement with the authority, users of the authority's water and wastewater systems. Except as otherwise provided herein, the director of the authority or his designee, shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 54-43. - Sewage and waste disposal; use of public water and sewer systems required. 
                  (a)  Unlawful waste placement. It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit or permit to be deposited in any unsanitary manner on public or private property within the county or in any area under the jurisdiction of the county or the authority, any human or animal excrement, garbage, or other objectionable waste. It shall be unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within the county, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the county or the authority, any sewage or other polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with this division. Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful to construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool or other facility intended or used for the disposal of sewage. 
                  (b)  Connection to public systems. In the interest of the public health, sanitation and general welfare, all buildings and structures located within the authority's service delivery area, of every nature, use and design, intended for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or for other purposes shall have a proper source of potable drinking water and sewage disposal. The owner of each house, building, or property used for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or for other purposes is hereby required at the owner's expense to install suitable toilet facilities therein, and to connect the facilities directly into the authority's wastewater system in accordance with the authority's regulations, if such connection is required by state law, to wit, the state's manual for on-site sewage management systems, section 290-5-26-.03 (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. 290-5-26-.03), which requires connection to public sewer when it is located within 200 feet of the owner's property or is located in a public right-of-way, road, or alley abutting the property. 
                  (c)  No permit issuance. No permit for the construction of any residence, building or other facility which cannot be served by public sanitary sewer shall be issued, and no certificate for the use and occupancy for any existing residence, building or other facility which cannot be served by public sanitary sewer shall be issued, unless a septic tank or individual sewage management system permit has been issued by the board of health in conformity with any state-wide minimum standards for on-site sewage management systems and the regulations of the county board of health then in force and effect. 
                  (d)  Connection upon failed system. Upon the failure of a septic tank or individual sewage management system, use of such system shall be discontinued. The property owner shall cause the building or structure to be connected to the public sanitary sewer system if such connection is required by state law, to wit, the state's manual for on-site sewage management systems, section 290-5-26-.03 (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. 290-5-26-.03), which requires connection to public sewer when it is located within 200 feet of the owner's property or is located in a public right-of-way, road, or alley abutting the property. Abandoned septic tanks and individual systems shall either be removed by the owner or filled with suitable material so as not to constitute a hazard or nuisance.

                  Sec. 54-45. - Determination of wastewater volume. 
                  Unless otherwise provided, the volume of wastewater delivered to the authority's wastewater system will be based upon the quantity of water purchased from, and metered by, the authority. If the volume of water delivered to the authority's wastewater system is greater or less than the volume purchased from the authority, the user shall make known to the authority such differences. If differences do exist, it shall be the obligation of the user to install authority-approved meters or other devices to determine the portion or quantity of wastewater delivered to the authority's wastewater system. At locations readily accessible for meter reading by the authority, separate water meters installed in the county right-of-way are preferred for measuring nonsewered consumptive water usage. The authority may consider establishing a constant ratio, factor or percentage to be applied to the metered water quantity delivered by the water system in order to determine the waste delivered by the user. Determining, as well as justifying, the factor to the authority will be the responsibility of the user. The value of this factor may be periodically reviewed for accuracy by the authority. Other methods may be established by the authority to estimate the quantity of wastewater released to the sanitary sewer which considers the amount of water consumed during different seasons. Users which claim wastewater volumes to be inaccurately determined by these methods shall bear the expense of installing authority-approved meters to estimate flows to the authority's wastewater system more accurately.

                  (1)  A requirement for the contributing jurisdiction to adopt a sewer use article which is at least as stringent as this article with prohibited discharges and local maximum allowable limits that are at least as stringent as those set out in division 2 of this article. The requirement shall specify that such ordinance and limits must be revised as necessary to reflect changes made to this division or local limits; 
                  (2)  A requirement for the contributing jurisdiction to submit a revised user inventory on at least an annual basis; 
                  (3)  A provision specifying which pretreatment implementation activities, including wastewater discharge permit issuance, inspection and sampling, and enforcement, will be conducted by the contributing jurisdiction; which of these activities will be conducted by the director; and which of these activities will be conducted jointly by the contributing jurisdiction and the director; 
                  (4)  A requirement for the contributing jurisdiction to provide the director with access to all information that the contributing jurisdiction obtains as part of its pretreatment activities; 
                  (5)  Limits on the nature, quality, and volume of the contributing jurisdiction's wastewater at the point where it discharges to the authority's wastewater system; 
                  (6)  Requirements for monitoring the contributing jurisdiction's discharge; 
                  (7)  For those users that are not the jurisdiction itself, a provision ensuring the director access to the facilities of contributing nonresidential users located within the contributing jurisdiction's boundaries for the purpose of inspection, sampling, and any other duties deemed necessary by the director; and 
                  (8)  A provision specifying remedies available for breach of the terms of the intergovernmental agreement.

                  (a)  Generally. All persons owning or operating septage pump trucks or other liquid waste transport trucks shall not discharge, directly or indirectly, wastewater into the authority's wastewater system, unless such person shall first have applied for and received a mobile discharge operation ("MDO") permit from the authority. Each hauler is required to comply with any and all rules and regulations adopted by the authority for haulers. Persons doing business under a MDO permit shall not discharge into the county any sewage which originated outside of the boundaries of the county. Anyone found guilty of discharging into the county such "holding tank" waste known to have originated outside of the county shall be subject to a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 for each violation. 
                  (b)  Permit. The MDO permit shall have a one-time nonrefundable fee as may be established by the authority, provided that such permit shall be subject to revocation by the authority for violation of any provision of this article or reasonable regulation established by the authority. Such permits shall be limited to the discharge of wastewater which has none of the prohibited substances enumerated in division 2 of this article. The owners of such vehicles shall affix and display the permit number on the side of each vehicle used for such purposes. 
                  (c)  Discharge locations and conditions. The director shall designate the locations and times where such trucks may be discharged, and may refuse to accept any truckload of waste where it appears to the authority that the waste could interfere with the effective operation of the authority's wastewater system. Further, it shall be the responsibility of the dumping vehicle operator to advise the treatment plant operator of the contents of his load and its source prior to dumping. The director may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. Anyone found guilty of discharging into the authority's wastewater system at a location not approved for dumping shall be subject to a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 for each incident. 
                  (d)  No hauled industrial waste will be accepted without express permission from the director. The director shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits in accordance with the application and approval provisions set forth in sections 54-40 through 54-42. The director also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this article. 
                  (e)  Waste-tracking form. All industrial waste haulers must submit to the authority a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry and known or suspected waste constituents. In any event, no industrial waste hauler shall be permitted to haul and discharge hazardous wastes (as identified by the May 19, 1980 Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Regulations, part 261 or any revision thereof or the Georgia Comprehensive Waste Management Act and associated rules) into the authority's wastewater system.

                  Sec. 54-74. - Dilution. 
                  No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation developed by this article and EPD. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. Where necessary in the opinion of the authority, equalizing may be required to bring constituents or volume to an acceptable level and to hold or equalize flows such that no peak flow conditions may interfere with the authority's wastewater system. Said equalization or holding unit shall have a capacity suitable to serve its intended purpose, as stated in this section, and be equipped with acceptable outlet control facilities to provide flexibility in operation and accommodate changing conditions in the waste flow.

                  (a)  Generally. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or slug load, that may cause potential problems for the authority's wastewater system, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the authority of the incident. The notification shall include: 
                  (1)  Location of discharge; 
                  (2)  Type of waste discharged; 
                  (3)  Concentration and volume; and 
                  (4)  Corrective actions taken by the user. 
                  (b)  Written notice. Within five calendar days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the authority a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the authority's wastewater system, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this section or other applicable law. Noncompliance with this provision shall constitute a violation of this section and subject the user to the penalties described in this section. 
                  (c)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees to call the authority in the event of a discharge of any of the substances enumerated in this article as a prohibited discharge. 
                  (d)  Accidental discharge/slug control plan. Periodically, the director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. In addition, the director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the director may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
                  (1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
                  (2)  Description of stored chemicals;

                  Sec. 54-98. - Sanitary sewer discharge permits for nondomestic users; the general permit. 
                  (a)  Generally. All nondomestic users (who are not determined to be significant industrial users) must have issued to them a general permit prior to connection to the authority's wastewater system. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a permit shall be deemed a violation of this division and subject the user to the sanctions set forth in this article. Obtaining a permit does not relieve a user of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or regulations. Prior or subsequent to the issuance of a permit, the user is required to submit to the authority revised plans whenever alterations or additions to the user's premises or operations vary from the original submitted application. The director may also initiate inquiries concerning revisions and process changes at six-month intervals. 
                  (b)  Application process. All nondomestic users shall complete and submit to the director a sanitary sewer discharge permit application, together with any applicable application fee. Proposed new users shall make application no later than 90 days prior to their intended date of connection to the authority's wastewater system. The sanitary sewer discharge permit application shall be on a form provided by the director and shall be used for the purposes of determining whether the industry is a "significant industrial user," issuing a permit, and for other purposes. The sanitary sewer discharge permit application (which shall be the only permit application required for nondomestic users and those ultimately determined to be significant industrial users) shall include the following information, at a minimum: 
                  (1)  Name, address and location, if different from the address. 
                  (2)  SIC number according to the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, U.S. Office of Management and Budget, 1987, as amended.

                  Sec. 54-99. - Significant industrial user permits. 
                  (a)  Generally. All significant industrial users, as that term is defined in section 54-40, proposing to connect to the authority's wastewater system must obtain a permit ("SIU permit") before connecting to the authority's system. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and subject the user to the sanctions set forth in this article. Obtaining a permit does not relieve a user of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or regulations. Prior or subsequent to the issuance of a permit, the user is required to submit to the authority revised plans whenever alterations or additions to the user's premises or operations vary from the original submitted application. The director may also initiate inquiries concerning revisions and process changes at six-month intervals. 
                  (b)  Application process. All significant industrial users shall complete and file with the director an application for a permit consistent with the requirements for the application set forth in section 54-98(b), accompanied by any applicable application fee. Proposed new users shall make application not less than 90 days prior to their intended date of connection to the authority's wastewater system. The completed permit application for a general permit described in section 54-41 will serve as an application for a SIU permit. 
                  (c)  Review and determination. The director will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require additional information. Within 60 days of receipt of a complete SIU permit application, the director will determine whether or not to issue a SIU permit. The director may deny any application for a SIU permit, in writing, stating the reasons for denial.

                  (c)  Periodic compliance reports. 
                  (1)  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the director, but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with this article. 
                  (2)  All other users who have been issued general permits are required to submit compliance reports at the intervals set forth in each user's individual permit. The compliance reports shall address the discharge parameters and all other information indicated as being necessary to report as shown in the user's permit. 
                  (3)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
                  (4)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the director, using the procedures prescribed in this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
                  (d)  Reports on compliance with federal categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the authority's wastewater system, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a report containing the information described in subsections (a)(2)d. through f. of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's longterm production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with this article. 
                  (e)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the director of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system, which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 60 days before the change. 
                  (1)  The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a new permit application according to the procedures set forth in this article. 
                  (2)  The director may issue a permit under this article or modify an existing permit under this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
                  (3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
                  (f)  Reports of potential problem, including slug loading. 
                  (1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the authority's wastewater system, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
                  (2)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability, which may be incurred as a result of damage to the authority's wastewater system, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
                  (3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (f)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
                  (g)  Reports from domestic users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the director as the director may require, in writing. 
                  (h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the authority monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the authority samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
                  (i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
                  (1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the authority, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the authority's wastewater system of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the authority's wastewater system, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under the provisions of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of this article. 
                  (2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (i)(1) of this section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (3)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  (4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  (5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
                  (j)  Sampling and testing. All sampling and testing performed for reporting requirements shall be conducted in accordance with this article. 
                  (k)  Submission date. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.

                  (a)  Sampling procedures. 
                  (1)  Except as indicated in subsection (b) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
                  (2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, hexavalent chromium, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab sample collection techniques. 
                  (b)  Testing procedures. 
                  (1)  All wastewater-monitoring samples required by the authority shall be tested by an independent laboratory for the parameters required, with the results submitted to the authority on the original laboratory report sheets. Copies will not be accepted and will constitute a rebuttable presumption that the test did not conform to standards. 
                  (2)  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, or in accordance with any applicable EPA testing procedure of general acceptance in the chemical testing industry, provided, however, that all such analyses shall be determined in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 136, which requirements shall prevail in the event of conflict. 
                  (3)  The cost incurred for testing shall be the responsibility of the user.

                  (a)  Sampling and testing records. Any permitted user subject to the reporting requirements and/or sampling requirements of this article shall maintain records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required. Such records shall include for all samples: 
                  (1)  The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and names of the person taking the samples; 
                  (2)  The dates analyses were performed; 
                  (3)  The name of the person who performed the analysis; 
                  (4)  The analytical techniques/methods used; and 
                  (5)  The results of such analyses. 
                  (b)  Monitoring activities and records of results. Any permitted user subject to the reporting requirements established in this article shall be required to retain for a minimum of three years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this article) and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the authority, state, or EPA. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the permitted user, or when requested by the authority, state, or EPA.

                  Sec. 54-105. - Industrial pretreatment facilities. 
                  (a)  Requirements. All users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with the limitations and provisions contained in this article and to achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the authority shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans prepared by a registered professional engineer showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the authority for review and must be approved by the authority prior to commencement of construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user of the responsibility for modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the authority under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the authority prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
                  (b)  Compliance schedules. The timing of construction and operation of pretreatment facilities as required hereby shall be in accordance with the compliance schedules provided by the authority as described in this article; however, the authority shall also have the authority to issue compliance schedules independent of the permitting process and such compliance schedules may be enforced by the authority as provided in division 5 of this article, pertaining to enforcement and penalties. 
                  (c)  Maintenance of pretreatment facilities. All wastewater pretreatment facilities shall be properly and adequately maintained by the user so as to achieve the intended purpose of the facilities. 
                  (d)  Discharge during peak flow periods restricted. Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the authority's wastewater system and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (e)  Storage and flow-control facility installed and maintained. The director may require any person discharging into the authority's wastewater system to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
                  (f)  Approved combustible gas detection meter installed and maintained. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

                  Sec. 54-129. - High strength wastewater surcharge. 
                  (a)  Establishment. Users discharging "high strength" wastewater into the authority's wastewater system may be assessed a monetary surcharge, in addition to the normally required wastewater use charges, in an amount to be calculated as shown in the table in this subsection. A high strength wastewater is defined as wastewater which contains the shown parameters in excess of the concentrations provided in the following schedule: 

                   
                  (b)  Surcharge basis. All persons discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers shall be charged and assessed a surcharge, in addition to any sewer services charge, if these wastes have concentrations greater than the applicable treatment plant design loadings and are less than the prohibited levels. The amount of surcharge, which is hereby charged and assessed against all persons discharging industrial wastewater into the public sewers, has been established by the water and sewerage authority as provided in the county fee schedule in section 18-19. 
                  (c)  Determining persons liable for surcharge. The director or his designees shall determine which users are discharging waters or wastes to the authority's wastewater system in excess of acceptable levels. The surcharge rate shall be calculated using the following formula: 
                  Monthly Surcharge Fee = (constituent mg/l constituent mg/l allowed) × 8.34 × average daily flow in 1,000,000 gallons per day × number of days in month × surcharge rate. 
                  (d)  Quantitative measurement of surchargeable parameters. The measurement of the surcharge parameters (BOD 5 , TSS, ammonia, and phosphorus) shall be conducted as follows: 
                  (1)  Monitoring to determine surcharge shall be conducted by the industrial user as specified in the user's permit, except that frequency of testing for surchargeable parameters shall be a minimum of two tests per month. If the permit requires more frequent testing, then the average of all test results will be used to calculate the surcharge. If the permit requires less frequent testing for compliance purposes, then testing frequency will be increased to twice per month. 
                  (2)  The authority may sample the user as often as desired at the authority's expense. The authority will split the sample with the industrial user at the user's request. 
                  (e)  Billing; payment of surcharge. The surcharge shall be assessed against each user on the basis of an arithmetic average of all tests conducted for each month and be billed monthly by the authority with the normal user charge, and the conditions for payment and penalties applicable to the normal user charge shall apply to the surcharge.

                  Sec. 54-165. - Consent orders. 
                  The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified in the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as binding contracts under state law and shall be judicially enforceable by petition for specific performance. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(3), 9-15-2005) 
                  Sec. 54-166. - Injunctive relief. 
                  When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit, or consent order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the county superior court, through the authority attorney, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains the further violation and/or compels the specific performance of the permit, consent order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(4), 9-15-2005) 
                  Sec. 54-167. - Termination of discharge. 
                  (a)  Any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
                  (1)  Violation of permit conditions; 
                  (2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
                  (3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
                  (4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
                  (5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in division 2 of this article. 
                  (b)  Such user shall be notified, in writing, of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered a reasonable opportunity to show cause before the director why the proposed action should not be taken. The decision of the director, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall be deemed a final action by the authority. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. Aggrieved users may seek judicial review by petitioning the superior court of the county for writ of certiorari. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(5), 9-15-2005) 
                  Sec. 54-168. - Emergency suspensions. 
                  (a)  The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after oral notice to the user, whenever, in the director's sole discretion, such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge that threatens to interfere with the operation of the authority's wastewater system, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
                  (1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the authority's wastewater system, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in this article are initiated against the user. 
                  (2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of a termination hearing under this article. 
                  (b)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(6), 9-15-2005) 
                  Sec. 54-169. - Civil liability. 
                  (a)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit or consent order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the authority for a maximum penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other longterm average discharge violation, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation, but shall not exceed $25,000.00 cumulatively. The director and/or his designee shall assess the penalty by issuing a notice of penalty in writing to the violator, which notice of penalty shall specify the amount of the penalty, the actions giving rise to the violation, and any other information relevant to the violation or correction thereof. A violator shall pay to the authority the assessed penalty within 30 days of the date of the notice of penalty. Failure of a violator to do so shall subject the violator to continuing penalties and other enforcement actions. 
                  (b)  In addition to any monetary fine imposed, the director may seek restitution of reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the authority. 
                  (c)  In determining the amount of penalty to be imposed, the director and/or his designee shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions voluntarily undertaken by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
                  (d)  In lieu of the provisions of subsections (a) through (c) of this section, the director may, in his sole discretion, elect to file a complaint for civil liability in the superior court, in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 12-5-51. 
                  (e)  A violation may appeal the notice of penalty to the authority by submitting a written notice of appeal to the director within ten days of the date of the notice of penalty. The decision of the authority shall be final. Aggrieved violators seeking review of the final administrative decision by the authority must do so by filing a petition for writ of certiorari in the county superior court. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(7), 9-15-2005) 
                  Sec. 54-170. - Criminal prosecution. 
                  (a)  A user who willfully or knowingly violates any provision of this article, a permit, or consent order issued hereunder, or any orders of a court issued in connection with this article, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. Upon a complaint lodged with the authority, or upon a complaint generated by the authority itself, a citation may be issued by the sheriff's office or a duly authorized representative of the authority, requiring the person to appear before the judge of the magistrate court of the county on a day and time certain to answer for the violation. Except as otherwise allowed by law, any person guilty shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per offense, imprisonment not to exceed 60 days, or both. 
                  (b)  Alternatively, the director may apply for a state warrant for violation of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-53, returnable to the superior court. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(8), 9-15-2005) 
                  Sec. 54-171. - Remedies nonexclusive. 
                  The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the authority's enforcement response plan. However, the director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(9), 9-15-2005) 
                  Sec. 54-172. - Notification delivery of enforcement actions. 
                  Written notice personally delivered or placed in the U.S. mail by certified mail to the person's last known address, as shown in authority utility billing records, shall be deemed sufficient notice for all enforcement actions in this article. Such notice may be personally served on the user or any authorized representative of the user. With respect to ordinance violations regarding nonpayment of amounts due under this article, only notice mailed to the person's last known address, by regular U.S. mail, of the amount owed and the date upon which payment is due shall be required. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(10), 9-15-2005) 
                  Sec. 54-173. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
                  (a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. The term "severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (b)  Permissible bypass. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  Procedures for approval of bypass. 
                  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  (2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (d)  Prohibited bypass. Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  (1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  (2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
                  (3)  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  Approval of anticipated bypass. The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d) of this section.

                  Sec. 54-200. - Authority's right of revision. 
                  The authority reserves the right to establish, by future amendment to this article or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the authority's wastewater system.

                  Sec. 54-201. - Confidential information. 
                  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the authority's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as "trade secrets" under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted in writing at the time of submission of the information or data. To the extent allowed by law, when requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.
