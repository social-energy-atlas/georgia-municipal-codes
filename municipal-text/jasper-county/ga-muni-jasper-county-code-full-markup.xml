PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                  This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Jasper County, Georgia.
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2000 Code, as updated with ordinances
                  subsequently adopted by the board of county commissioners through November 21, 2011. The source of each
                  section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note
                  indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  2/426
                  comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2000 Code, as
                  updated, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within
                  each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and
                  which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their
                  location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local
                  government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash
                  refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.
                  Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this
                  system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their
                  proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one
                  section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would
                  be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles,
                  may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the
                  end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or
                  division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that
                  the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
                  Page Numbering System
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an
                  abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents
                  the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon
                  indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of
                  the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may
                  or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

                  3/426
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several
                  headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language
                  generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the
                  indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is
                  interested.
                  Looseleaf Supplements
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the
                  publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be
                  properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders
                  of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete
                  pages.
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised
                  pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted
                  according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be
                  inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and
                  filed for historical reference purposes.
                  Acknowledgments
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim Jenkins, Senior Code Attorney, Michael Raabe, Code
                  Attorney, and Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is
                  gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance
                  throughout the project.
                  The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Sherry Braley, Zoning Administrator, for her cooperation and assistance
                  during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have
                  resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens
                  and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

                  (a)
                  There is established in Jasper County a board of commissioners, which shall be the governing authority of Jasper
                  County and shall be composed of five members as provided in this section. For the purpose of electing members
                  of the board, Jasper County is divided into five commissioner districts which shall be and correspond to those
                  five numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this Act and further identified as Plan
                  Name: jasperp1 Plan Type: Local User: staff Administrator: Jasper. When used in such attachment, the terms
                  'Tract' and 'BG' (Block Group) shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the
                  report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. The
                  separate numeric designations in a Tract description which are underneath a 'BG' heading shall mean and
                  describe individual Blocks within a Block Group as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the
                  United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Jasper County which is not included
                  in any such district described in that attachment shall be included within that district contiguous to such part
                  which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of

                  nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such
                  noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least
                  population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Except as otherwise
                  provided in the description of any commissioner district, whenever the description of such district refers to a
                  named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United
                  States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia.

                  Sec. 5. - Debts.
                  The Authority shall not be authorized to create in any manner any debt, liability or obligation against the State of

                  The members of the Authority shall receive no compensation for their services to the Authority.

                  execute any trust agreement or indenture not in conflict with the provisions of this amendment to provide
                  security for any bonds issued as provided herein, and such trust agreement or indenture may provide for
                  foreclosure or forced sale of any property of the Authority upon default on such bonds either in payment of
                  principal or interest or under any term or condition under which such bonds are issued. Nothing herein contained
                  shall be construed to create a right to compel any exercise of the taxiing powers of Jasper County to pay any
                  such bonds or the interest thereon nor to enforce payment thereof against any property of Jasper County.
                  Sec. 8. - Additional bonds.

                  purpose may become necessary. Bonds so placed in escrow shall, when sold and delivered, have such standing
                  with the bonds of the same issue as may be provided in the authorizing proceedings.

                  No bonds except refunding bonds shall be issued hereunder unless the Authority shall have found and declared
                  that:
                  (1)
                  The undertaking for which the bonds are to be issued will increase employment in Jasper County.
                  (2)
                  The lessee or purchaser of the building or buildings involved will not by virtue of establishing operations in said
                  County, reduce the number of employees employed by said lessee or purchaser elsewhere in the State of Georgia.
                  Sec. 10. - Use of funds.
                  No moneys derived by the Authority from any source other than gifts and contributions from private individuals,
                  firms, or corporations shall at any time be used for entertainment, or other promotional expenses.
                  Sec. 11. - Property.

                  personal, held by the Authority at the time of such dissolution shall revert to Jasper County subject to any
                  mortgages, liens, leases or other encumbrances outstanding against or in respect to said property at that time.

                  and trade within Jasper County and reducing unemployment to the greatest extent possible, and this amendment
                  and any law enacted with reference to the Authority shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of these
                  purposes.
                  Sec. 13. - Effective date.
                  This amendment shall be effective immediately upon proclamation of its ratification by the Governor and the
                  first members of the Authority shall be appointed within thirty (30) days after such proclamation.

                  operations shall be limited to the territory embraced within said County. The General Assembly shall not extend
                  the jurisdiction of the Authority nor the scope of its operations beyond such limits.

                  danger or damage; and
                  (F)
                  Upon the issuance of any order assessing a civil penalty and after the expiration of 30 days following the date of
                  any such order, with no appeal taken as provided in Code Section 50-13-19 of the O.C.G.A. [O.C.G.A. Â§ 50-13-
                  19], the authority, through and by its executive director, or such other employee as the authority designates, shall
                  have the right and power to issue executions on any such order assessing a civil penalty, and, in the amount
                  thereof, such execution shall be a lien upon and against the land and other properties of the assessed party which
                  lien shall be of equal priority, rank, and dignity having the same attributes, rights, and powers as to collection
                  and foreclosure thereof as an execution for unpaid ad valorem taxes of the State of Georgia or the County of
                  Jasper; and
                  (19)
                  To do all things necessary or convenient to carry out the powers expressly given in this Act.
                  Sec. 4. - Financing projects.
                  The authority, or any authority or body which has or which may in the future succeed to the powers, duties, and
                  liabilities vested in the authority created in this Act, shall have power and is authorized at one time, or from time
                  to time, to borrow money for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost, as defined in this Act, of any one
                  or more projects and to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds of that purpose. The
                  principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund provided in this section
                  for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates not to exceed
                  the maximum limit prescribed in O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 82, the "Revenue Bond Law," as now or hereafter
                  amended, shall be payable semiannually, and shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal
                  and interest as may be determined by the authority and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of
                  the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the
                  resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds.
                  Sec. 5. - Revenue bonds; form; denominations; registration; place of payment.
                  The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and
                  shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  18/426
                  interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company inside or outside the state. The bonds may be issued
                  in coupon or registered form, or both, as the authority may determine and provision may be made for the
                  registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both the principal and interest.
                  Sec. 6. - Signatures and seal of revenue bonds.
                  All such bonds shall bear the manual or facsimile signature of the chairperson of the authority and the attesting
                  manual or facsimile signature of the secretary of the authority, and the official seal of the authority shall be
                  affixed thereto. The signature of one of such officers shall be placed manually on each bond. Any coupons
                  attached thereto shall bear the manual or facsimile signature of the chairperson or the secretary of the authority.
                  Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of such person and any bond may bear the facsimile signature of
                  and may be manually signed, sealed, and attested to on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual
                  time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of
                  such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. In case any officer
                  whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease
                  to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for
                  all purposes the same as if he or she had remained in office until such delivery.
                  Sec. 7. - Negotiability; exemption from taxation of revenue bonds.
                  All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable
                  instruments under the laws of the State of Georgia pertaining to negotiable instruments. Such bonds are declared
                  to be issued for essential public and governmental purposes, and the bonds, their transfer, and the income
                  therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation within the state.
                  Sec. 8. - Sale, price of revenue bonds.
                  The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best
                  interests of the authority.
                  Sec. 9. - Proceeds of bonds.
                  The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless
                  otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in any trust indenture, additional
                  bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of any deficit which, unless otherwise provided in the
                  resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in any trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same and
                  shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the
                  same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for
                  which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund provided for in this Act to be used for paying
                  the principal of and the interest on such bonds.
                  Sec. 10. - Interim receipts, certificates or temporary bonds.
                  Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts,
                  interim certificates, or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the
                  issuance of the latter.
                  Sec. 11. - Replacement of lost or mutilated bonds.
                  The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or
                  lost.
                  Sec. 12. - Conditions precedent to issue of revenue bonds; object of issue.
                  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or
                  things than those proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified or required by this Act. In the
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  19/426
                  discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular
                  project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall
                  become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution
                  may be passed at any regular, special, or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority of the quorum as
                  provided in this Act.
                  Sec. 13. - Credit not pledged.
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Jasper County
                  or a pledge of the faith and credit of the county, but the bonds shall be payable solely from the fund provided for
                  in this Act, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the
                  county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their
                  payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of
                  this section; provided, however, that the governing authority of Jasper County is authorized to contract with the
                  authority for any of the undertakings authorized in this Act. Such county may in connection therewith, jointly or
                  severally, use any funds from any lawful source or from the proceeds of the issue and sale of bonds for such
                  purpose.
                  Sec. 14. - Trust indenture as security.
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and
                  between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank inside or outside the
                  state having the power of a trust company. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, charges,
                  revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue
                  bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies
                  of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth
                  the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the
                  maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all
                  moneys; and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and
                  approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority who are satisfactory to
                  the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor; and may also require that the security given by contractors
                  and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or any other moneys be satisfactory to such
                  purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue
                  bonds may be issued. It shall be unlawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state
                  to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by
                  the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may
                  restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and
                  debentures of private corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other
                  provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholder. All expenses
                  incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and
                  repair of the project affected by such indenture.
                  Sec. 15. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid.
                  The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in any trust indenture,
                  provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency,
                  bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such bonds and shall hold and apply the same to the
                  purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.
                  Sec. 16. - Sinking fund.
                  The revenues, fees, tolls, charges, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of
                  whether or not such fees, tolls, charges, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which
                  bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority
                  to the payment of the principal of and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  20/426
                  issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source
                  received, which pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular
                  intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund, which sinking fund shall be
                  pledged to and charged with the payments of:
                  (1)
                  The interest on such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due;
                  (2)
                  The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due;
                  (3)
                  The necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest; and
                  (4)
                  Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as provided in this section.
                  The use and disposition of such sinking funds shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the
                  resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise
                  be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue
                  bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing
                  the issuance of the bonds or in any trust indenture, surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the
                  purchase or redemption of bonds, and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and
                  shall not again be issued.
                  Sec. 17. - Remedies of bondholders.
                  Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto
                  and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights provided for in this Act may be
                  restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by any trust indenture, may, either at law or in
                  equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of
                  the State of Georgia or granted under this Act or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and
                  compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by
                  the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and
                  other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.
                  Sec. 18. - Refunding bonds.
                  The authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issue of revenue refunding bonds of the authority for
                  the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act and then outstanding,
                  together with accrued interest thereon. The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and all other
                  details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be
                  governed by the foregoing provisions of this Act insofar as the same may be applicable.
                  Sec. 19. - Jurisdiction and venue.
                  Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such
                  authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Jasper County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to
                  validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in such court which
                  shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions; provided, however, that the venue of any action against
                  the authority shall be in the superior court of the county in which the power of the authority is exercised or
                  services are provided by the authority if the act giving rise to such action is committed within such county.

                  21/426
                  Sec. 20. - Validation of revenue bonds.
                  Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of O.C.G.A. Â§ 36-82-
                  60 et seq., the "Revenue Bond Law," as now or hereafter amended. The petition for validation shall also make
                  defendant to such action any consolidated government, municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or
                  instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority to furnish or receive the services
                  and facilities of the water and sewerage system for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and
                  such consolidated government, municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required
                  to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be
                  inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts
                  adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds when validated, and the
                  judgment of validation, shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds against the authority issuing the
                  same and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality contracting with the authority.
                  Sec. 21. - Interest of bondholders protected.
                  While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the
                  authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will
                  affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or
                  authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the
                  interests and rights of the holders of such bonds. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the
                  authority and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall
                  constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.
                  Sec. 22. - Moneys received considered trust funds.
                  All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as
                  proceeds of short-term loans, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, fees, and earnings, shall be deemed
                  to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act.
                  Sec. 23. - Tax-exempt status of the authority.
                  The properties of the authority, both real and personal, are declared to be public properties used for the benefit
                  and welfare of the people of the State of Georgia and not for purposes of private or corporate benefit and income,
                  and such properties and the authority shall be exempt from all taxes and special assessments of any consolidated
                  government, city, county, or the state or any political subdivision thereof.
                  Sec. 24. - Powers declared supplemental and additional.
                  The foregoing sections of this Act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing
                  of the things authorized thereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by
                  other laws and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing.

                  exemptions which supplement applicable general law. Amendments to the act are indicated by parenthetical
                  history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains
                  unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic
                  purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made
                  for clarity are indicated by brackets.
                  Sec. 1. - Amount of exemption.
                  Each resident of Jasper County who is entitled to a homestead exemption under the provisions of O.C.G.A. Â§ 48-
                  5-44, 48-5-47, or 48-5-52 is granted an exemption on that person's homestead from those Jasper County ad

                  homestead. The value of that property in excess of such exempted amount shall remain subject to taxation. It is
                  the intent of this Act to increase each homestead exemption provided for by general law by $6,000.00; it is not
                  the intent of this Act to create a new homestead exemption.
                  Sec. 2. - Supplemental exemption.

                  been eligible for the immediately preceding year for such exemption. The supplemental exemption shall not
                  affect state ad valorem taxes and shall only operate to increase the homestead exemption for the purposes of
                  county ad valorem taxes.
                  (c)
                  Any person who, as of January 1, 1998, is 62 or over and has applied for and is eligible for the $4,000.00

                  automatically renewed from year to year as long as the applicant occupies the residence as a homestead. After a
                  person has filed for the applicable exemption, it shall not be necessary for such person to file thereafter for any
                  year, and the exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person unless and until such person no longer meets

                  (a)
                  By contract or by county personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared at least on an annual basis. A
                  supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the
                  board of commissioners during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code.
                  The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where
                  necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so
                  prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the
                  latest ordinance included in the supplement.

                  from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.
                  (c)
                  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the
                  supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the
                  supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier
                  may:
                  (1)
                  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions.

                  (3)
                  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to
                  accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers.
                  (4)
                  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division,"
                  etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________" (inserting section numbers to indicate
                  the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code).
                  (5)
                  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted
                  into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material
                  included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  failure of a county government officer or county government employee to perform an official duty unless this
                  Code specifically provides that failure to perform the duty is to be punishable as provided in this section.

                  imposition of a fine not to exceed $1,000.00, by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of time not to
                  exceed 180 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment, or up to the limits of any penalty provided by state law

                  all of the other qualifications for licensees required hereunder. The license of such deceased person shall be held
                  by the administrator, executor, or personal representative of such deceased person only for the time necessary to
                  complete administration of the decedent's estate and to dispose of the license or his interest therein, but in no

                  A licensee may make application to the board of commissioners to approve the transfer of the location of its
                  business premises. Any new location shall meet all requirements of a new license to be issued hereunder except
                  for the payment of a license fee. Upon approval of the requested transfer of location by the board of
                  commissioners, the existing license shall be surrendered to the county and a new license issued showing the new
                  location upon payment of a processing fee to the county.

                  55/426
                  An application for transfer shall be made by the proposed transferee as an initial application for a license under
                  this article. The proposed transferee's application shall specify that if approved, an existing current license of the
                  same class issued under this article will be transferred to the applicant and the license to be transferred shall be
                  fully identified in the transferee's application. The transferee's application shall otherwise be in complete
                  conformity with the requirements of this article for new applicants. The transferee's application shall include
                  written consent for such transfer of each person constituting a holder of the existing license.

                  31 and shall otherwise be processed in accordance with the provisions of this article for a new application. If the
                  board of commissioners approve the application of the transferee, the transferee shall be issued a license for the
                  unexpired term of the then existing license upon surrender of the existing license.
                  (e)
                  Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit one or more members of a partnership or limited liability
                  company holding a license to withdraw from the partnership and to assign his interest in such entity to one or
                  more of the other members who were members at the time of the issuance of the then current license. Such
                  withdrawal shall not serve to bring in any new members into such entity; however, a licensee may take in new
                  members or additional shareholders provided any additional member or shareholder meets all requirements of
                  this article.

                  percent of the total amount due during the first 30-day period following the date such report and remittance were
                  due, and a further penalty of 15 percent of the amount of such remittance for each successive 30-day period or
                  any portion thereof during which such report and remittance are not filed. The filing of a false or fraudulent

                  of the remittance which would be required under an accurate and truthful report. Such failure to make a timely
                  report shall also constitute grounds for revocation of the business license issued by the county to the wholesaler.

                  consumption an excise tax at the rate set forth in section 4-58 and in the following manner:
                  (1)
                  The tax imposed by this section shall be computed and payable monthly. Each wholesale dealer or distributor
                  selling, shipping, or delivering distilled spirits to any retail dealer in the county shall, as a condition to the
                  privilege of conducting said business in the county:
                  a.
                  Keep and maintain true and correct records of all sales shipments, or deliveries of distilled spirits to each retail
                  dealer in the county, such records to be preserved for a period of not less than three years and to be made
                  available on request for the inspection of any duly authorized representative of the county.
                  b.
                  Collect from such retail dealer in the county, at time of delivery of distilled spirits, the amount of tax due under
                  the terms of this section and hold the same in trust for the county until such tax is remitted to the county as
                  herein provided.

                  57/426
                  On or before the tenth day of each calendar month, each wholesaler shall make a verified and comprehensive
                  report to the county which shall correctly show all sales and deliveries of distilled spirits to retail dealers in the
                  county for the calendar month immediately preceding the date of said report. Said report shall show the name
                  and addresses of each retail dealer, the quantities delivered to each retail dealer, the amount of excise tax
                  collected under the terms of this section, and such other reasonable information as may be requested by the
                  county. Said report shall be accompanied by remittance payable to the county, for all taxes collected or due, as
                  shown on said report.
                  d.
                  The excise tax levied in this section is levied upon the retailer licensed to do business in the county, and it is the
                  intent of this section to so levy said tax but require the payment of the tax at the time of delivery to the retailer by
                  the wholesaler, who shall have the responsibility of remitting the tax to the county on behalf of the retailer. In the
                  event the tax due hereunder is not timely paid, a ten percent penalty on the gross tax will be levied by the county
                  against each defaulting retailing licensee for whom the tax is not timely paid.
                  (2)
                  If any wholesale dealer or distributor fails or refuses to make the reports required herein, the county shall notify
                  such dealer or distributor of such default by certified mail, and if the reports are not made and the taxes remitted
                  within five days from the date of receipt of such notice, such wholesale dealer or distributor shall be prohibited
                  from making any further deliveries in the county, and the retail dealer licensees served by such wholesale dealer
                  or distributor to whom the taxes should have been paid shall be subject to having their licenses suspended or
                  revoked as herein provided.
                  (3)
                  It shall be a violation of this article for any person to sell at retail within the county any distilled spirits on which
                  the taxes herein provided for have not been paid.
                  (4)
                  It is unlawful and a violation of this article for any wholesale dealer or distributor or person to deliver any
                  distilled spirits to any retail dealer in the county without, at the time of such delivery, collecting the excise taxes
                  as herein provided.
                  (5)
                  Any person violating any of the provisions of this section or who shall assist any retail dealer in distilled spirits
                  in the county to evade or avoid the payment of the taxes herein provided for shall be guilty of a violation of this
                  section and upon conviction thereof in the magistrate court shall be fined up to $1,000.00 or sentenced as
                  provided by law, and any licensee under this section so convicted shall also be subject to having his license
                  suspended or revoked.

                  period of not less than three years and to be made available upon request for inspection by duly authorized
                  representatives of the county;
                  b.
                  Collect from the consumer at the time such drinks are served the amount of tax due under the provisions of this
                  section and hold the same in trust for the benefit of the county until such time as said tax is remitted to the

                  information as may be reasonably required by the county, said report to be accompanied by remittance to the
                  county of all taxes due under this section, as reflected by said report.
                  (2)
                  In the event payment of the tax levied pursuant to the provisions of this section is not timely received by the
                  county as hereinabove provided, a penalty in the amount of ten percent of the tax due will be levied by the
                  county against the defaulting licensee.
                  (3)
                  In addition to the penalty imposed in subsection (2) of this section, any person or entity violating any provision
                  of this section or who shall assist any licensee to evade or avoid payment of the tax levied pursuant to the
                  provisions of this section shall be guilty of a violation of this Code and upon conviction in the magistrate court
                  of the county shall be punishable as provided for in section 4-133 for ordinance violations with a fine of up to
                  $1,000.00, and any licensee so convicted shall, in addition to all other penalties provided in this section, be

                  Sec. 4-94. - Reporting requirements for restaurants.
                  (a)
                  Each licensee for sale of alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption operating as a restaurant shall, as a
                  condition of maintaining such license, file with the county manager within 30 days after the end of each calendar
                  quarter:
                  (1)
                  A sworn statement on forms approved by the county of the licensee's retail sales during the preceding calendar
                  quarter. Such statements shall reflect the licensee's total dollar sales amounts for the applicable calendar quarter,
                  the total sales amounts for sales of malt beverages and wine, the total sales amounts for distilled spirits sold by
                  the drink, and total dollar sales for food items.
                  (2)
                  Certified copies of the licensee's state department of revenue sales and use tax monthly reports as filed with state
                  department of revenue for each month during the applicable calendar quarter.
                  (b)
                  Any sale of a food or beverage containing any alcoholic beverage shall be deemed to be a sale solely of malt
                  beverages, wine or distilled spirits, as the case may be, and no such sale shall be included as food sales in the
                  quarterly reports. The fact that the sale of food during any calendar quarter exceeds sales of alcoholic beverages
                  shall not be conclusive on the issue of whether the licensee is meeting the requirements of operating a restaurant
                  as herein defined; however, the failure of the food sales to exceed the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be prima
                  facie evidence that the principal business of the licensee is not that of serving food as required to meet the
                  definition of a restaurant.
                  (c)
                  Such quarterly statements shall be confidential in nature and shall not be open for public inspection except as
                  may be required by state law. Such forms shall be used solely by the county manager for determination of
                  whether or not the licensee remains qualified to hold its retail license for sale of alcoholic beverages for onpremises consumption in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Failure to timely file such statements
                  shall be a violation of a county ordinance punishable as provided in section 4-133 and shall further be a basis for
                  the revocation of the license granted under this chapter. If, after appropriate notice and hearing, the judge of the
                  county's magistrate court finds that a licensee's violation of this section is not willful and the licensee otherwise
                  meets the requirements of a restaurant as provided in this chapter, the judge shall have the option of imposing a
                  probationary period on the licensee, not to exceed six months, and any further violations of this article shall be a
                  basis for revocation of such license.

                  Purchases of distilled spirits by licensees for on-premises consumption must be in containers of 700 milliliters or
                  greater unless a particular brand is only packaged in a smaller container. Sale of distilled spirits by a licensee for
                  on-premises consumption in unbroken packages or in any quantity other than appropriate for on-premises
                  consumption is prohibited.

                  It shall be unlawful for a licensee for on-premises consumption of distilled spirits to add to the contents of a
                  bottle or to refill empty bottles, or in any other manner to misrepresent the quantity, quality, or brand name of
                  any alcoholic beverage. Bottles of distilled spirits must be broken immediately upon being emptied of their
                  original contents.

                  A licensee under this chapter shall be responsible for the conduct of his employees while such employees are
                  acting within the scope of their employment.
                  (b)
                  Managerial employees and bartenders of licensees for on-premises sale of alcoholic beverages must obtain an
                  annual permit for such employment from the county sheriff's department.

                  An application for such permit on a form and with fingerprints and other such exhibits as may be prescribed by

                  following commencement of such employment, together with payment of a nonrefundable processing fee to
                  cover the costs of investigation and issuance of the permit.
                  (d)
                  Upon approval of the permit application, the county sheriff shall issue to the applicant a permit containing the
                  permit number, photograph of the applicant and other identification information deemed appropriate by the
                  sheriff.
                  (e)
                  To qualify for issuance of such permit, the applicant must not have been convicted of any felony or violation of
                  the laws of any jurisdiction relating to the manufacture, sale or use of alcoholic beverages or controlled
                  substances or of any sex crime or crime against children, five years of the sentence for which, including
                  probation or parole, has not been completed at the time of application for the permit.
                  (f)
                  Managerial and bartender employees must renew such employment permits annually and display them at all
                  times when engaged in transactions involving alcoholic beverages. No licensee shall permit a managerial or
                  bartender employee to work at his licensed premises unless such employee shall have been issued a current valid

                  the owner cannot be reached and/or secure the animal in a reasonable amount of time, based on the animal's
                  condition, the animal will be euthanized.

                  A business or practitioner with no location or office in the state shall only be required to pay occupation tax to
                  the local government in the state where the largest dollar volume of business is done or service is performed by

                  is the jurisdiction where such employee works for the longest period of time within the calendar year.
                  (c)
                  If a business or practitioner commences business in the county on or after July 1 in any year, the occupation tax

                  In addition to the other remedies provided for in this chapter for the collection of the occupation tax levied in this
                  chapter, the zoning administrator, upon any tax or installment of such tax becoming delinquent and remaining
                  unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount against the person, partnership or corporation liable for such
                  tax, which execution shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the date when such tax or
                  installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property in the county of the person, partnership or
                  corporation liable for such tax, all as provided by the ordinances of the county and the laws of the state. The lien
                  of such occupation tax shall become fixed on and dated from the time when such tax or any installment thereof
                  becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the magistrate judge of the county upon the property of the
                  defendant located in the county, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of such
                  execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by
                  ordinances of the county and the laws of the state, and the defendant in such execution shall have the rights of
                  defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by applicable laws in regard to tax
                  executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the
                  zoning administrator against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was
                  made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered
                  after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against
                  whom the execution issues pays the tax in full, together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person
                  may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

                  This chapter shall be subject to amendment or repeal, in whole or in part, at any time, and no such amendment or
                  repeal shall be construed to deny the right of the board of commissioners to assess and collect any of the taxes or
                  other charges prescribed. The amendment may increase or lower the amounts and tax rates of any occupation and
                  may change their classification. Payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting
                  the levy or collection by the county of additional occupational taxes upon the same person, property or business.

                  This chapter does not repeal or affect the enforcement of any part of any ordinance heretofore passed where
                  taxes levied under such prior ordinance have not been paid in full. So much and such parts of ordinances
                  heretofore passed as provided for the issuing and enforcing of execution for any tax or assessment required by
                  such ordinances, or that imposed fines or penalties for the nonpayment of such tax, or for the failure to pay
                  regulatory fees provided for in such ordinances, or failure to comply with any other provisions of this chapter,
                  shall continue and remain in force until such tax, regulatory fee or assessment shall be fully paid.

                  Sec. 8-24. - Enforcement of provision.
                  It is made the duty of the zoning administrator to see that the provisions of this chapter relating to occupation
                  taxes are observed, and to summon all violators of the same to appear before the magistrate judge. It is made the
                  further duty of the zoning administrator, county sheriff, members of the sheriff's department, and their assistants,
                  to inspect all registrations issued by the county, as often as in their judgment it may seem necessary to determine
                  whether the registration held is the proper one for the business sought to be transacted thereunder.

                  in occupation tax to one or more types of businesses or practitioners of occupations or professions as part of a

                  and the county development regulations, the county commissioners shall then determine in their sole discretion if
                  it is in the best interest of the county to grant or deny the application. Upon granting of an application, county
                  public works and any public utility involved within the right-of-way shall be notified of the proposed paving and
                  construction. The applicant, during the paving of the road, shall be required to provide a short apron for every
                  existing driveway.

                  When the full amount of such charges are not paid by the violator within 30 days after receipt of said statement
                  as provided for in this section, the board of commissioners shall cause to be recorded in the execution docket a
                  sworn statement showing the cost and expense incurred by the county, the dates of county action, the location of
                  the property for which action was taken, and the name of the person to be charged for the expenses incurred. The
                  recordation of such statement shall constitute a lien on the personal and real property of the person to be charged
                  and shall remain in full force and effect until final payment is received in full, including accrued interest from the
                  date of recording and any and all costs. Such amount as shall constitute final payment shall be subject to

                  with intent or by accident, acts of God of force of nature, or where a permit for such long-term or permanent
                  disposal has been issued by the proper authority as defined in section 22-6, the county may attach or otherwise
                  affix a permanent addendum to the deed of real property wherein the dump site exists, stating the approximate
                  size and location of the dump on the property and a description of the materials contained therein, as well as the
                  dates such dumping occurred, to be recorded on the property plat as a fill area (O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-8-30). The
                  purpose of said attachment is to preserve the health and safety of current and future landowners and users of said
                  properties, to promote the integrity of property description and values, and to record the location of said dump
                  sites. The county's exercise of this subsection shall in no way be mandatory, and the county or its agents shall not
                  be held liable for exercise of action or inaction for implementation of this subsection, nor for the costs of such
                  action or inaction.
                  (g)
                  This section shall apply with full force and effect regardless of the provisions of any order of the court in which
                  the violator was convicted. This section should not be construed as an excuse for failure on the part of the
                  violator to perform any cleanup ordered by the court, nor shall it be considered as a mitigating factor in any
                  contempt action against a violator who has failed to obey the order of the court.

                  Sec. 105-83. - Initial information.
                  (a)
                  This article outlines the procedures to be followed in order to comply with the requirements of this chapter. The
                  developer, who initially may not be familiar with this chapter, first visits the office of the director of planning to
                  get information concerning ordinances affecting his proposed development.
                  (b)
                  The director of planning will show the developer a copy of this chapter. The developer may either review the
                  document in the office or he may purchase a copy for his own use.

                  Sec. 105-84. - Compliance with chapter required.
                  (a)
                  Approval of subdivision plats. Any person proposing to subdivide land within the county must submit to the
                  county plans and plats of the proposed subdivision which conform to all regulations set forth in this chapter.
                  Application for approval of the documents must be made to the director of planning under procedures contained
                  in this article.
                  (b)
                  Platting authority. The planning commission is the official platting authority of the county. No subdivision plat
                  may be recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county unless the director of planning has
                  verified its compliance with a preliminary plat that has first been approved by the planning commission. The
                  filing or recording of a subdivision plat without the approval of the director of planning as required by this
                  chapter is a violation of this chapter and is punishable as provided by this article.

                  159/426
                  (c)
                  Physical development. No developer or person may proceed with any construction work on a proposed
                  subdivision before a preliminary plat and construction plan have been approved and a land disturbance permit
                  has been obtained.
                  (d)
                  Use of final plat. The transfer of, sale, agreement to sell, or negotiation to sell land by reference to, exhibition of,
                  or other use of a final subdivision plat that has not been given approval by the director of planning and recorded
                  in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county is prohibited. The description in the instrument of
                  transfer or other documents does not exempt the transaction from this prohibition.
                  (e)
                  Acceptance and maintenance of roads. Land designated, reserved, proposed, or dedicated as a public road by a
                  developer on a subdivision plat will be accepted and perpetually maintained by the county if any of the following
                  conditions exist:
                  (1)
                  The proposed street has been constructed according to a set of construction plans, preliminary plat, and final plat
                  that have been properly approved according to this chapter and the intent of such dedication has been indicated
                  on the final plat and the required maintenance bonds have been received as specified herein.
                  (2)
                  The street has been accepted as a public road or otherwise received the legal status of a public road by the county
                  prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
                  (f)
                  Erection of structures. No building permit will be issued, no building may be erected, and no factorymanufactured building may be installed on any lot in any subdivision unless the road giving access to the lot and
                  all utilities serving the lot have been approved as meeting the standards required by this chapter, or unless such a
                  street has attained the status of a public road prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter
                  is derived.

                  (a)
                  Five stages of subdivision review and approval. The procedure for the review and approval of a subdivision
                  consists of five required stages. These are as follows:
                  (1)
                  Pre-application review.
                  (2)
                  Preliminary plat.

                  Construction plans.
                  (4)
                  Final plat.
                  (5)
                  Recording of final plat.
                  (b)
                  Summarization of stages. These five steps are summarized in subsections (b)(2) through (6) of this section.
                  Details of each step are provided in sections 105-86 through 105-93
                  (1)
                  Exception for minor subdivisions. Subdivisions that do not involve the platting, construction, or opening of new
                  streets or the construction or extension of new publicly owned or central sewerage or water facilities, and
                  subdivisions which do not involve improvement to existing streets are defined as minor subdivisions. They are
                  subject only to the requirements of the pre-application review, final plat and recording stages of this chapter.
                  They must comply in all respects with the other requirements of this chapter. Minor subdivisions will be
                  reviewed by the planning commission and, if found acceptable, signed by the director of planning in the form of
                  a final plat.
                  (2)
                  Pre-application review stage. Whenever the subdivision of a tract of land is proposed, the developer is to consult
                  early and informally with the director of planning. The developer will submit sketch drawings and basic data
                  reflecting existing conditions at the site and in its vicinity and the proposed development layout of the
                  subdivision. The purpose of the pre-application review stage is to facilitate the subsequent preparation of plans
                  and plats by discussing matters relating to the proposed subdivision, the county zoning ordinance set forth in
                  chapter 119, and this chapter.
                  (3)
                  Preliminary plat stage.
                  a.
                  The developer must submit to the planning commission for approval a preliminary plat of the proposed
                  subdivision prepared in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. If the proposed subdivision abuts a state
                  highway, a letter of tentative approval by the state department of transportation must accompany the preliminary
                  plat submission.
                  b.
                  If any lots are smaller than three acres and on-site sewage disposal systems are proposed for those lots, the
                  county health department must have reviewed the project prior to planning commission review and signed the
                  preliminary plat indicating which lots are acceptable for conventional or alternative sewage disposal systems.
                  The developer must also furnish a copy of the preliminary plat to the utility company that serves water to the
                  immediate area if applicable.
                  c.
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  161/426
                  Approval of the preliminary plat by the planning commission will be indicated on the face of the preliminary plat
                  following a vote of approval at the meeting by the signature of the planning commission chairperson.
                  (4)
                  Construction plan stage. Prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit, the developer must submit to the
                  director of planning a set of construction plans of the proposed subdivision prepared in accordance with the
                  provisions of this chapter. The design presented in the construction plans must conform to the preliminary plat.
                  The construction plans shall include street profiles, topography, utility plans, drainage plans, sediment and
                  erosion control plans, construction details, and other information as may be required by the director of planning.
                  The construction plan stage requires the approval of the director of planning and any other review entities
                  specified by the county commission. It is the responsibility of the director of planning to ensure that the plans are
                  reviewed and approved by the appropriate entities for compliance with technical requirements of this chapter
                  prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit.
                  (5)
                  Final plat stage. After completion of the physical development of all or a phase of the area shown on the
                  preliminary plat as approved by the planning commission, and before selling any lots, a final plat together with
                  the required certificates must be submitted to the director of planning for approval.
                  (6)
                  Recording and dedication. After the final plat is signed by the director of planning, it is to be recorded in the
                  office of the clerk of the superior court of the county. After recording, the appropriate deeds and documents must
                  be presented to the county commission for dedication and acceptance if applicable.

                  Sec. 105-86. - Pre-application review stage.
                  Before the submission of any plats to the director of planning, the developer must submit a sketch plat showing
                  the proposed development layout of the subdivision. The developer and director of planning should informally
                  discuss what this chapter requires and what the developer proposes to do. This will assist the developer in
                  preparing a preliminary plat and construction plans that meet from the very beginning the intent and standards
                  specified by this chapter so as to reduce undue time and expense in preparing plans that cannot be approved by
                  the planning commission.

                  (a)
                  Preliminary plat submission. After completing the pre-application review stage, and at least 30 days before the
                  regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the planning commission at which the developer desires planning
                  commission action, the developer must submit the following:
                  (1)
                  A letter requesting review and approval of a preliminary plat and giving the name and address of a person to
                  whom the notice of hearing and action on the preliminary plat is to be sent.
                  (2)
                  Six copies of the preliminary plat.

                  162/426
                  (3)
                  If the proposed subdivision abuts a state highway, a letter of tentative approval of the proposed subdivision by
                  the state department of transportation.
                  (b)
                  Additional information. The director of planning may ask for any additional information he feels is necessary for
                  the planning commission to properly evaluate the preliminary plat.
                  (c)
                  Official date of submission. The official date of submission of the preliminary plat will be the date of the next
                  regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the planning commission that is more than 30 days following proper
                  preliminary plat submittal to the director of planning.
                  (d)
                  Preliminary plat review. The planning commission will review the preliminary plat for conformance to this
                  chapter, the county zoning ordinance set forth in chapter 119, and other relevant regulations and will consider the
                  comments or suggestions of other appropriate review agencies, persons, or entities in regard to the plat. The
                  planning commission or director of planning will indicate on the preliminary plat, or by a written memorandum
                  attached to the preliminary plat, any comments or suggested changes that are necessary to meet the intent of this
                  chapter or to serve the best interests of the county.
                  (e)
                  Public hearing. Before acting on the preliminary plat, the planning commission will hear public input on the
                  preliminary plat. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at
                  least 15 days before the hearing.
                  (f)
                  Action of the planning commission. No more than 30 days after the official date of submission of the preliminary
                  plat, the planning commission will either approve the plat, conditionally approve the plat (noting the conditions
                  of approval on the plat), disapprove the plat, or table the plat for further consideration. Action may be taken on
                  the entire preliminary plat or any portion of it.
                  (g)
                  Failure of planning commission to act. If the planning commission fails to act within 60 days of the official date
                  of submission of the preliminary plat, the preliminary plat will be deemed automatically approved by the
                  planning commission.
                  (h)
                  Approval of preliminary plat. Approval of a preliminary plat is effective and binding upon the planning
                  commission for a period of no more than two years. Before the two-year period expires, the developer may
                  submit to the planning commission a request in writing for an extension of time. If the planning commission
                  grants such an extension, final subdivision construction drawings must be submitted, approved, and work must
                  begin within the limits of the extension.

                  (b)
                  Official date of submission. The official date of submission of the final plat will be the date that all required
                  documents have been received by the director of planning.
                  (c)
                  Final plat review. The director of planning will review the final plat for conformance with the approved
                  preliminary plat and construction plans and with this chapter and other relevant regulations.
                  (d)
                  Action of the director of planning. No more than 30 days after the official date of submission of the final plat, the
                  planning commission will either certify the final plat for recording, conditionally approve the plat (noting the
                  conditions of approval on the plat), or disapprove the plat. If the final plat is conditionally approved, once the
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  170/426
                  developer has complied with the conditions indicated, the planning commission will certify the plat, or
                  disapprove the plat. If the final plat is disapproved, the planning commission will cause the developer to be
                  notified in writing, stating the reasons for the disapproval. One copy and the original of the plat will be returned
                  to the developer, and one copy will be made part of the records of the planning office. Action may be taken on
                  the entire final plat or any portion of it.
                  (e)
                  Failure of director of planning to act. If the planning commission fails to act within 60 days of the official date
                  of submission of the final plat, the final plat will be deemed automatically approved by the planning commission.
                  (f)
                  Approval of final plat. Following approval of the final plat by the planning commission, the final plat shall be
                  submitted to the board of commissioners for review at its next available meeting. Using the same review
                  standards as the planning commission, the board of commissioners shall review the plat for sufficiency and may
                  also inquire from various county departments as to whether all improvements shown on the final plat have been
                  satisfactorily completed and installed as required. Failure of the owner to satisfactorily complete such
                  improvements as are shown on the plat shall result in disapproval of the plat. The board of commissioners may
                  approve, disapprove or defer action on the plat if required improvements have not been satisfactorily completed.
                  Once the final plat has been approved by the board of commissioners, the owner may record the plat which shall
                  constitute acceptance by the county of all roads and other public improvements shown on the final plat. Only
                  after such approval and recordation of the final plat may building permits be issued on the properties described
                  by the plat.

                  Sec. 105-93. - Recording and dedication.
                  (a)
                  Recording of final plat. Upon approval of a final plat, the developer must have the final plat recorded in the office
                  of the clerk of the superior court of the county. The developer will be responsible for the payment of the
                  recording fee at the time of recording of the final plat.
                  (b)
                  Dedication of platted streets, other public spaces, and utilities. Final plat approval by the planning commission
                  does not constitute acceptance of any dedications to the public. After final plat approval by the planning
                  commission, the developer must prepare appropriate documents and plans as constructed, if required, and request
                  that the county board of commissioners accept dedicated streets, other public spaces, and utilities as presented on
                  the final plat.

                  The minimum design standards and minimum improvements as described in article V of this chapter are hereby
                  declared to be mandatory and non-appealable. These provisions shall not be waived by any commission, agent,
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  174/426
                  or employee of the county. Only the board of county commissioners can modify the minimum design standards
                  and minimum improvements by modification of this chapter.
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2005(2), Â§ 411)
                  Sec. 105-95. - Chapter amendments.
                  (a)
                  If a developer or landowner finds that a proposed subdivision of land does not meet the requirements of this
                  chapter, he may request that this chapter be amended. The developer or owner wishing to request an amendment
                  must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person,
                  possessing notarized authorization in writing under the owner's signature. The planning commission or the
                  county commission may also propose an amendment. However, the power to approve and enact an amendment
                  rests with the county commission.
                  (b)
                  Application for an amendment may be made with the director of planning. The director of planning will take the
                  required information and transmit it to the planning commission for its consideration. No application is to be
                  accepted from any person in violation of this chapter. If an applicant for an amendment or any other action by the
                  planning commission or county commission is, at the time of such an application, determined by the director of
                  planning to be in violation of this chapter, then the director of planning will be prohibited from accepting or
                  processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one of the following:
                  (1)
                  He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must
                  notify the director of planning that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the director of planning
                  as to the violation.
                  (2)
                  He must be tried before a court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted of charges and present a certified copy of
                  the court order to the director of planning within 30 days of the final order of the court.
                  (c)
                  All applications for amendment must first be reviewed by the planning commission. The planning commission
                  will study the proposed amendment and determine if it furthers the goals and intent of this chapter, as well as
                  other applicable ordinances of the county. Prior to the review, the director of planning may review the proposed
                  amendment and make written recommendations to the planning commission.
                  (d)
                  The planning commission must then conduct a public hearing on the amendment. Notice of the hearing must be
                  published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least 15 days but not more than 45 days before
                  the hearing. The time, place and purpose of the hearing, the location of the property, name of subdivision and the
                  present zoning classification must be indicated in the newspaper notice.
                  (e)
                  The following policies and procedures will be observed in conducting the required public hearing:
                  (1)
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  175/426
                  The hearing will be held in the planning commission meeting room or county courthouse.
                  (2)
                  Written comments on the subject of the hearing may be submitted by any citizen or property owner at any time
                  prior to the adjournment of the hearing.
                  (3)
                  Persons desiring to be heard orally may present their views at the hearing. The length of time of oral
                  presentations permitted to each speaker will be governed by the planning commission chairperson, depending
                  upon the number of persons present and desiring to speak, provided that the minimum time allotted proponents
                  and opponents shall be no less than ten minutes per side. Remarks of a personal nature will not be tolerated
                  during the hearing.
                  (4)
                  Any person desiring a transcript of the hearing must arrange for a court reporter at their expense.
                  (5)
                  Cross examination of persons making oral presentations by non-commission members will not be permitted.
                  (6)
                  All questions will be addressed to the chairperson of the planning commission or the planning commission
                  member then presiding.
                  (f)
                  The planning commission will, when considering a proposed amendment to this chapter, determine whether the
                  amendment is substantially related to promote the public health, safety, or general welfare. In considering the
                  proposed amendment, the planning commission will balance the benefit to the public of the regulations against
                  the limitations it may impose upon property owners, and scrutinize the application in light of the character of the
                  land to which it may apply.
                  (g)
                  The planning commission will make a written record of the comments received at the public hearing. After the
                  public hearing, and at an official meeting of the planning commission, the planning commission will formulate
                  its recommendations to the county commission, recording them in the minutes for that meeting. The planning
                  commission must send the written record of comments received at the public hearing along with its
                  recommendations on the proposed amendment in writing to the county commission within 30 days of the close
                  of the public hearing. If the planning commission fails to send its recommendations to the county commission
                  within 60 days of the close of the public hearing, it will mean that the planning commission approves.
                  (h)
                  After reviewing the record of the public hearing and considering recommendations from the planning
                  commission, the county commission will then make an official decision on the proposed amendment. The
                  decision need not concur with the recommendation of the planning commission.
                  (i)
                  If the county commission denies a proposed amendment, a minimum period of 12 months must pass before the
                  same amendment proposal is again submitted for consideration.

                  If the county commission executes an action that the developer or other aggrieved party believes to be contrary
                  to law, that action may be appealed to the superior court of the county. Findings of fact, however, may not be
                  appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date on which the action of the county commission
                  was taken.

                  (a)
                  Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter must face penalties. If a developer or landowner
                  exhausts the decision and appeals procedures contained herein and is still dissatisfied with the decision, he must
                  then comply with the final decision or face penalties. Anyone who violates any of the provisions of this chapter,
                  upon conviction, will be fined no more than $1,000.00 for each offense. In addition, he must pay all costs and
                  expenses involved in the case. Each week such a violation continues constitutes a separate offense.
                  (b)
                  The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor,
                  agent, or other person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such a violation may each be found
                  guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties provided here.

                  Sec. 105-98. - Remedies.
                  If any building or land is used or maintained in violation of this chapter, anyone, including the county, who
                  would be harmed by such a violation may initiate legal proceedings to obtain an injunction or other appropriate
                  remedy to stop the violation or to prevent any act that would constitute such a violation. Other legal remedies are
                  also available as provided by state law.

                  Suitability of land. Land on which there is a danger to health, safety, or property must not be platted for
                  residential use or other use that will continue or increase such danger, unless such hazards can be and are
                  corrected. Examples of such conditions are as follows:
                  (1)
                  Land subject to flooding or improper drainage.
                  (2)
                  Land with excessive slope or other physical constraints that make it unsuitable for development.

                  name must not duplicate or closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision.
                  (c)
                  Access. Access to every subdivision must be provided over a paved public road, and every lot within a
                  subdivision must be served by a publicly dedicated street or a private street meeting the standards of a public

                  (d)
                  Density development. The planning commission will consider proposals from developers concerning
                  conservation subdivision (the reduction of minimum lot sizes in exchange for the setting-aside of public space or
                  undisturbed space) or other smart-growth proposals. Regulations for conservation subdivisions are set forth in
                  article VI of this chapter.
                  (e)
                  Community assets. In all subdivisions, reasonable best efforts shall be utilized by the developer to maintain and
                  preserve all natural features such as large trees, watercourses, historical sites, and similar community assets
                  which add attractiveness and aesthetic value to the property if preserved. In addition the developer shall comply
                  with all county ordinances and state and federal laws which govern the development and construction activities

                  105-221.
                  (1)
                  Continuation of existing streets. Wherever slope will permit, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision must
                  provide for the alignment and continuation or projection of existing streets into adjoining areas.
                  (2)
                  Street names. Streets or roads that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with existing streets should have
                  the same name as the existing street. The names of new streets and roads are subject to the approval of the

                  avenue, drive, etc.) is different.
                  (3)
                  Development along arterial and major collector streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an arterial street
                  or major collector street (where street classification exists) the planning commission may require a driveway or
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  178/426
                  road approximately parallel to and on either side of the right-of-way of the arterial street to provide access to lots
                  along the arterial street while avoiding direct driveway access on the arterial street. Such a road shall be at least
                  20 feet from the major road or railroad. The planning and zoning commission may require a turn lane in the
                  center of the arterial or major collector streets to facilitate traffic flow and ensure the safety of entering into the
                  subdivision.
                  (4)
                  Intersections. The centerlines of no more than two streets may intersect at any one point. Streets must be laid out
                  so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. No street may intersect at any other street at an angle of
                  less than 80 degrees. The angle of intersection is to be measured at the intersection of the street centerlines.
                  (5)
                  Offset intersections (street jogs). Offset intersections with centerline offsets of less than 100 feet are not
                  permitted.
                  (6)
                  Cul-de-sac streets.
                  a.
                  The maximum permitted length of a cul-de-sac street (street with no outlet) is 1,000 feet. Cul-de-sac street length
                  is measured from the nearest intersection of street centerlines or the nearest paved, fire-marshal-approved
                  emergency vehicle turnaround.
                  b.
                  Cul-de-sac streets must be provided with a turnaround at the closed end having a right-of-way of at least 116 feet
                  in diameter. The paved area of the turnaround shall be an uninterrupted area of pavement at a minimum diameter
                  of 85 feet and a right-of-way of at least 116 feet in diameter. However, with the consent of the director of
                  planning, the paved area of the turnaround may be a circular street with an outside diameter of at least 80 feet, a
                  pavement width of at least 24 feet, and a right-of-way diameter of 100 feet, with an unpaved interior area to
                  allow for the planting of trees and shrubs.
                  c.
                  The developer is encouraged to provide bikeways and trails to connect the homes on the cul-de-sac to other parts
                  of the neighborhood.
                  (7)
                  Private streets. The planning commission may permit private streets in planned developments where controlled
                  access or privacy is desired by the developer. Such streets must meet the development standards for public streets
                  and shall be maintained by the developer or homeowners' association. Private street planned developments shall
                  have temporary and permanent accommodation for ingress and egress of public safety, utilities, U.S. mail and
                  garbage disposal during construction and post development.
                  (8)
                  Half streets. Half streets are prohibited. Whenever a street is planned adjacent to the proposed subdivision tract
                  boundary, the entire street right-of-way must be platted within the proposed subdivision.
                  (9)
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  179/426
                  Split-level streets. Streets which are constructed so as to have two traffic ways (each at a different level within
                  the same right-of-way) must provide any additional right-of-way required by this chapter when cut and fill
                  techniques have been used in the construction of the street.
                  (10)
                  Alleys. Alleys or service drives may be required at the rear of all lots used for multifamily, commercial, or
                  industrial developments, but are not required for one- or two-family residential development unless the alley or
                  service drive is to provide secondary access to a lot whose natural grade is more than six feet above the finished
                  street grade, or unless the developer shows the need for an alley or service drive to the satisfaction of the
                  planning commission.
                  (11)
                  Marginal access streets. These are streets which are constructed so as to provide secondary access only. No more
                  than six lots may abut any such street, and no such street may exceed 1,000 feet in length. Such streets may not
                  be used as through streets and should be permitted only when lots abut an arterial or major collector street.
                  (12)
                  Minimum required street right-of-way width. The right-of-way is the perpendicular distance across a street from
                  property line to property line. Minimum required street right-of-way is as follows:
                  a.
                  Arterial street: 80 feet.
                  b.
                  Collector street: 80 feet.
                  c.
                  Local street: 60 feet (50 feet is acceptable with curb and gutter).
                  d.
                  Marginal access: 30 feet.
                  e.
                  Alley/service: 24 feet.
                  f.
                  Cul-de-sac: 116 feet diameter.
                  (13)
                  Curb and gutter. Curb and gutter construction is required for developments where the majority of lots (excluding
                  cul-de-sac lots) have less than 125 feet road frontage.
                  (14)
                  Culvert installation. The developer is required to install a driveway culvert at the time of construction for each
                  lot when constructing new roads without curb and gutter construction on streets where the majority of lots have
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  180/426
                  less than 200 feet of road frontage. Culverts are only required on cul-de-sac lots if the requirement holds for
                  remainder of the street.
                  (15)
                  Striping. Streets shall be striped as required by the applicable ordinances and regulations of the county as well as
                  the applicable provisions of state law and the applicable regulations of the Georgia Department of Transportation
                  (GDOT). Local streets with speed limits of 30 miles per hour or less shall not require striping. All remaining
                  streets shall be striped in accordance with GDOT standard specifications.
                  (16)
                  Minimum required street pavement width. Pavement widths listed here do not include curb and gutter width,
                  which is four feet minimum. Minimum required asphalt pavement width is as follows:
                  a.
                  Arterial street: 24 feet.
                  b.
                  Collector street: 22 feet.
                  c.
                  Local street: 22 feet.
                  d.
                  Marginal access: 12 feet.
                  e.
                  Alley/service: 12 feet.
                  f.
                  Cul-de-sac: 85 feet diameter.
                  (17)
                  Additional right-of-way on existing streets. In subdivisions that abut existing streets, the developer must provide
                  additional rights-of-way to meet stated minimum right-of-way requirements on the existing street as follows:
                  a.
                  Where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the street, the entire right-of-way must be provided.
                  b.
                  When the subdivision is located on one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way measured
                  from the centerline of the existing roadway must be provided.
                  (18)
                  Grading and paving standards for roads. Grading associated with road construction must be performed as
                  specified in article XIII of this chapter. All roads must be paved according to the specifications outlined in
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  181/426
                  articles XIV and XV of this chapter.
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2005(2), Â§ 502)
                  Sec. 105-127. - Development standards for lots.
                  All lots established in the county after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived must
                  comply with the development standards contained in this section. However, where provisions of chapter 119
                  apply and are stricter, those provisions take precedence. Development standards for lots are as follows:
                  (1)
                  Lot lines. As far as practical, side lot lines must be roughly perpendicular or radial to street lines.
                  (2)
                  Lot frontage arrangements. Land must be subdivided in a manner that provides each lot in the subdivision with
                  direct abutting access to an existing public street or to an approved street contained within the proposed
                  subdivision. Each non-cul-de-sac lot must meet the minimum buildable width by zoning district as outlined in
                  chapter 119. (See flag lots in subsection (6) of this section.) Lots fronting on culs-de-sac must maintain at least
                  60 feet of frontage.
                  (3)
                  Adequate building sites. Each lot must contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the
                  limits of existing easements or building setback lines required by this chapter or any existing ordinance as is
                  appropriate.
                  (4)
                  Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots are prohibited unless required by the planning commission.
                  (5)
                  Reverse frontage lots. Reverse frontage lots may be included in major subdivisions and private street
                  subdivisions abutting a minor collector, major collector or arterial road provided the following standards are
                  satisfied:
                  a.
                  An easement of at least 25 feet in width, across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along
                  the line of lots abutting any minor collector, major collector or arterial road or local street.
                  b.
                  The backs of the adjacent houses must be screened from view as follows:
                  1.
                  The easement may retain its natural, undisturbed vegetation if existing trees and understory shrubs will
                  adequately screen the view of the backs of the adjacent houses.
                  2.
                  Supplemental vegetation may be added within the easement to provide adequate screening.
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  182/426
                  3.
                  The easement may be improved with a landscaped earthen berm of no less than four feet in height.
                  (6)
                  Flag lot. A flag lot is a lot, the main portion of which is located away from the public street with a connecting
                  strip of land at least 60 feet wide providing a minimum of 60 feet of frontage on the public street and which does
                  not have a buildable site (exhibiting minimum lot width) within 500 feet of a public road. Flag lots are prohibited
                  in subdivisions unless topographic conditions or the shape and orientation of the property to be subdivided make
                  the inclusion of some flag lots necessary in the judgment of the planning commission. A flag lot is not intended
                  to provide access to other properties so as to circumvent the street and right-of-way requirements of this chapter.
                  A flag lot is intended only to provide a means of using a portion of a property for residential purpose that might
                  not be accomplished through conventional street development.
                  (7)
                  Lot remnants. Lot remnants are prohibited. Such remnant areas must be added to adjacent lots, rather than
                  remain as unusable parcels. Cemeteries are excepted.
                  (8)
                  Monuments. All lot corners must be marked with solid steel rods no less than one-half inch in diameter, and at
                  least 2Â½ feet long, driven into the ground such that no more than two inches protrudes from the ground surface.
                  (9)
                  Cemeteries. The area within cemeteries shall not contribute to the minimum required lot area.
                  (10)
                  Off-street parking. Each lot is required to provide a minimum of two spaces, and a maximum of four spaces for
                  off-street parking of passenger cars and light trucks. A minimum of two of these spaces must be either a carport
                  or a garage that is complementary to the principal structure erected on the lot.
                  (11)
                  Driveways. Each lot shall have a driveway connecting the required off-street parking to the street. The driveway
                  must be constructed of concrete, asphalt, or brick pavers.
                  (12)
                  Storage shed/utility buildings. Storage sheds and utility buildings are used to store lawn and garden
                  equipment/tools, small household items. Only one such building is permitted on a subdivision lot. It must be
                  complementary to the principal structure.
                  (13)
                  Sod. A minimum of 2,000 square feet of grass sod shall be installed on each lot.
                  (14)
                  Commercial and industrial lots. The size, shape and arrangement of commercial and industrial lots, where
                  platted and classified as a subdivision, are subject to the approval of the planning commission and the
                  development of said lots shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this chapter and this Code.
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  183/426
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2005(2), Â§ 503)
                  Sec. 105-128. - Development standards for utility installations.
                  (a)
                  Utility easements. When it is found to be necessary and desirable to locate public utility lines in other than street
                  rights-of-way, easements must be shown on the plat for such purposes. Such easements must not be less than 20
                  feet wide and, where possible, must be centered on rear or side lot lines.
                  (b)
                  Installation of utilities. After grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied, all of the
                  underground work within the street right-of-way (water mains, gas mains, etc.) must be installed completely and
                  approved throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. At the same time, all service connections
                  must be stubbed out to each lot.
                  (c)
                  Water supply systems.
                  (1)
                  Public water system. If a state environmental protection division (EPD) approved public water supply is
                  available to a proposed subdivision and connection to it is permitted, water mains, fire hydrants, and stub
                  connections to each lot within the subdivision must be provided as shown on approved construction plans. If an
                  EPD-approved public water supply is not available, the developer must size all lots to accommodate a well and
                  an on-site septic system in accordance with county health department specifications. In order to meet minimum
                  fire protection needs, all water mains must be six inches or greater, with approved hydrants at not more than
                  1,000-foot intervals. Systems shall be tested by county fire services.
                  (2)
                  Individual water supply. When an EPD-approved public water supply is not available, the developer must
                  carefully consider the capability and suitability of the general area of the subdivision to support individual water
                  supplies and on-site septic systems on each lot. The planning commission must consider the recommendation of
                  the county health department and county fire services (see hydrant requirement in subsection (c)(1) of this
                  section) regarding any proposed private water supplies in considering approval of a plat.
                  (d)
                  Sanitary sewerage disposal systems.
                  (1)
                  Public sewage system. If an EPD-approved public sewage system is available to a proposed subdivision and
                  connection to it is permitted, sewage mains and lateral connections to each lot within the subdivision must be
                  provided as shown on approved construction plans.
                  (2)
                  Community sewage system. If an EPD-approved public sewage system is not available, the developer may install
                  a central sewage system developed according to plans and specifications shown on the approved construction
                  plans and approved by the EPD or the county health department, as applicable.
                  (3)
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  184/426
                  Individual sewage system. When an EPD-approved public sewage system is not available and a community
                  sewage system is not proposed by the developer, the developer must carefully consider the capability and
                  suitability of the general area of the subdivision to support individual sewage systems (septic tanks). A level
                  three soil study will be required and the proposed sewage system must be approved by the county health
                  department.
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2005(2), Â§ 504)
                  Sec. 105-129. - Development standards for drainage facilities.
                  (a)
                  Watercourse and drainage easements. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
                  or stream, appropriate provisions must be made to accommodate stormwater and drainage through and from the
                  proposed subdivision. Such an easement must conform substantially with the lines of the watercourse and be
                  wide enough and of adequate construction to be satisfactory for the purpose. Proposed road construction shall be
                  designed to cross existing waterways roughly perpendicularly to minimize disturbance near the waterway. All
                  state and federal regulations regarding wetlands and stream crossings shall be followed.
                  (b)
                  Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary grassed open swales, pipes, culverts, drains,
                  drop inlets, bridges, etc., must be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. Cross-drains must be
                  provided to accommodate 100-year flow and must be long enough to traverse the full width of the roadway and
                  required slopes. All such facilities must be profiled and must also be shown on road profiles. Outfall ditching
                  must follow property lines on a 20-foot easement to rear property line or natural drainage course.

                  ARTICLE VI. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS
                  Sec. 105-159. - Purposes.
                  The purposes of conservation subdivisions are as follows:
                  (1)
                  To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally
                  sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
                  (2)
                  To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands,
                  streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
                  (3)
                  To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
                  (4)
                  To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the
                  amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development.
                  (5)
                  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential
                  development.
                  (6)

                  186/426
                  To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community.
                  (7)
                  To promote contiguous green space with adjacent jurisdictions.
                  (8)
                  To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street,
                  providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the
                  neighborhood.
                  (9)
                  To encourage street designs that reduces traffic speed and reliance on main arteries.
                  (10)
                  To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and
                  connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
                  (11)
                  To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access
                  to and views of open space.
                  (12)
                  To protect prime agricultural land and preserve farming as an economic activity.

                  Sec. 105-160. - General regulations.
                  (a)
                  Applicability of regulations. The conservation subdivision option is available as a use by right in all residential
                  zoning districts. An applicant shall comply with all other provisions of chapter 119 and all other applicable laws,
                  except those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein.
                  (b)
                  Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership
                  or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a
                  single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
                  (c)
                  Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be
                  determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the applicant:
                  (1)
                  Calculation. The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the
                  minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be
                  included in the total area of the parcel:
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances

                  (2)
                  Yield plan. The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the
                  applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots
                  possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be
                  capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations.
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2005(2), Â§ 602)

                  Maintenance responsibility. In the event the party responsible for maintenance of the open space fails to maintain
                  all or any portion in reasonable order and condition, the county may assume responsibility for its maintenance
                  and may enter the premises and take corrective action, including the provision of extended maintenance. The
                  costs of such maintenance may be charged to the homeowners' association, or to the individual property owners
                  that make up the homeowners' association, and may include administrative costs and penalties. Such costs shall
                  become a lien on all subdivision properties or through a special tax district encompassing the subdivision and
                  levy an ad valorem property tax annually in an amount adequate to fund maintenance and operations of the open
                  space.

                  instrument shall be one of the following:
                  a.
                  A permanent conservation easement in favor of either:
                  1.
                  A land trust or similar conservation-oriented nonprofit organization with legal authority to accept such
                  easements. The organization shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the conveyance instruments shall
                  contain an appropriate provision for retransfer in the event the organization becomes unable to carry out its
                  functions; or
                  2.
                  A governmental entity with an interest in pursuing goals compatible with the purposes of this chapter.
                  If the entity accepting the easement is not the county, then a third right of enforcement favoring the county shall
                  be included in the easement.
                  b.
                  A permanent restrictive covenant for conservation purposes in favor of a governmental entity.
                  c.
                  An equivalent legal tool that provides permanent protection, if approved by the county.
                  (2)
                  The instrument for permanent protection shall include clear restrictions on the use of the open space. These
                  restrictions shall include all restrictions contained in this article, as well as any further restrictions the applicant
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  193/426
                  chooses to place on the use of the open space.
                  (g)
                  Tax assessment of open space. Once a legal instrument for permanent protection has been placed upon the open
                  space, the board of tax assessors may be requested to reassess the open space at a lower value to reflect its more
                  limited use.

                  (3)
                  Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision.
                  (4)
                  Where it is determined to be practical to require the dedication of the additional half when adjoining property is
                  subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted to create a full width right-of-way serving the adjoining
                  tracts of land.
                  (5)
                  Any subdivision shall provide lanes for acceleration/deceleration, ingress, and egress, according to Table 105-
                  220.2. Any subdivision on a state highway or arterial road (as shown in the current comprehensive plan) shall
                  provide lanes for acceleration/deceleration, ingress, and egress regardless of traffic counts. Design requirements
                  of the state department of transportation shall be met.

                  names of the streets with which they align. The names of proposed streets shall not duplicate existing street
                  names, irrespective of the use of the word street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc., in the naming of the
                  street.
                  (k)
                  No-parking areas shall be established for the use of fire equipment and emergency vehicles to ensure access to

                  b.
                  Clearing and grubbing.
                  1.
                  All trees, stumps, logs, roots, grass, weeds, poles, and other objectionable matter shall be cleared and grubbed
                  from within the construction limits of the project.
                  2.
                  A minimum 30-foot undisturbed buffer shall be maintained on all property lines. Reference should be made to
                  ordinance requirements of the county which require a buffer of greater width than the minimum stated herein.
                  3.
                  No rubbish or other material resulting from the clearing and grubbing of the roadway shall be buried on site.
                  4.
                  If burning is permitted, all burn pits shall be located outside of the roadway construction limits. After burning,
                  the pit shall be cleared out. A county inspection is required prior to backfilling. Burn pits will be annotated on asbuilt drawing and furnished to the county on sheet not larger than 17 inches by 22 inches.
                  c.
                  Excavation.
                  1.
                  All grading operations shall be planned and executed by the contractor in such a manner as to provide suitable
                  subgrade material for the roadway with the top 12 inches compacted to 100 percent maximum dry density, 95
                  percent below the top. (Standard Proctor)
                  2.
                  In areas where the material in place is not suitable for subgrades, these areas shall be undercut a minimum of 12
                  inches and backfilled with suitable material.
                  3.

                  205/426
                  All rock and boulders in the roadbed shall be excavated and the space backfilled to the correct grade with
                  suitable material.
                  4.
                  Any stones, broken rock, or boulders resulting from the grading of the roadway may not be placed in any
                  roadway fill area except when approved by the director of planning and then under his supervision.
                  5.
                  During the construction of the roadway on a day-to-day basis, the roadbed edges shall be kept lower than the
                  center and the grading shall be done so that the surfaces of the excavated areas and fill shall be kept reasonably
                  smooth and well drained. Adequate surface ditches shall be cut at the tops of cut slopes, extending to each end of
                  the cuts in order to carry the water from the side hill. Side ditches or gutters emptying from cuts to fill areas shall
                  be turned outward so as to prevent erosion of the fill slopes.
                  d.
                  Placement of fill.
                  1.
                  Fill construction shall not begin until all clearing and grubbing of the fill area has been completed.
                  2.
                  All depressions in the ground shall be filled level with the adjacent surface using suitable material and
                  compacted to the approximate density of the surrounding soil before placement of the fill is begun.
                  3.
                  The entire area upon which fill is to be placed shall be plowed, scarified, and finely broken up to a depth of a
                  minimum of six inches.
                  4.
                  Before the placement of fill material is begun, all loosened soil shall be compacted the approximate density of
                  the underlying soil.
                  5.
                  Where a depth of fill and surfacing is three feet or less, the original ground shall be compacted a minimum 12
                  inches deep to at least 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density as determined from representative
                  samples of the material being compacted.
                  6.
                  In areas where layers of organic or other unstable materials exist, the existing ground shall be excavated, for the
                  full width of the fill area, to an underlying stable material. The subgrade thus created shall then be compacted to
                  the approximate density of the underlying material.
                  7.
                  All fill material shall be deposited and spread in uniform horizontal layers, not more than six inches thick, for the
                  full width of the fill area, and these layers shall be kept uniform by the use of graders, bulldozers or other
                  approved equipment.

                  8.
                  Each layer shall be compacted within the range of optimum moisture content necessary to achieve the
                  compaction required. Material containing too much water shall be dried to the correct moisture content. If the
                  material is too dry, water shall be added and uniformly mixed with the soil before it is compacted. Moisture
                  content shall be maintained to within plus or minus three percent of optimum.
                  9.
                  Fill shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density to within the top 12 inches of the fill.
                  The top 12 inches of the fill shall be compacted to at least 100 percent of the maximum dry density. A minimum
                  of one compaction test per 300 square yards of every 24 inches of lift shall be taken and results provided to the
                  director of planning.
                  10.
                  The entire roadbed shall be scarified and compacted with a sheep's foot or other approved rollers.
                  11.
                  While the work is in progress, the contractor shall maintain the surface in a manner so that the excavation, fills,
                  subgrade, base course, and ditches always present a smooth and even surface.
                  12.
                  The contractor shall have available on the job at all times at least one motor grader with adequate power to blade
                  and maintain the roadbed. Suitable scarifiers shall also be available for use whenever necessary.
                  13.
                  All density testing will be in accordance with ASTM D-698.

                  (a)
                  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
                  health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures
                  for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
                  safety and general welfare.
                  (b)
                  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are
                  inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect
                  of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.

                  Sec. 107-2. - Statement of purpose.
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public
                  and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
                  (1)
                  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood
                  damage at the time of initial construction;
                  (2)
                  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or
                  which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
                  (3)
                  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
                  (4)
                  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
                  increase flood hazards to other lands; and
                  (5)
                  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved
                  in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer
                  lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
                  (3)
                  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a
                  manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
                  (4)
                  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
                  (5)
                  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the
                  expense of the general public;
                  (6)
                  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and

                  hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood.
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding.
                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to
                  structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
                  facilities, structures and their contents.
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
                  order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
                  designated height.
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain
                  management. The term "freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to
                  flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
                  action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent
                  to the proposed foundation of a building.
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:
                  (1)
                  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of
                  Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
                  listing on the National Register;
                  (2)
                  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance
                  of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered
                  historic district;
                  (3)
                  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by states with historic
                  preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or
                  (4)
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  243/426
                  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by communities with historic

                  a.
                  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or
                  b.
                  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or floodresistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a
                  basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the
                  structure in violation of other provisions of this chapter.
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and
                  designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
                  "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a
                  site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property.
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more
                  manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for
                  establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a
                  community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for
                  establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of
                  construction commenced after May 6, 1996 [the effective date of the initial FIRM] and includes any subsequent
                  improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means
                  structures for which the start of construction commenced after November 21, 1994 [the effective date of the
                  FIRST floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent
                  improvements to such structures.
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the
                  construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
                  minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
                  concrete pads) is completed after November 21, 1994 [the effective date of the first floodplain management
                  regulations adopted by a community].
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing
                  and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps.
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is:
                  (1)
                  Built on a single chassis;
                  (2)
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  244/426
                  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
                  (3)
                  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and
                  (4)
                  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational,
                  camping, travel, or seasonal use.
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of
                  construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
                  means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings,
                  installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the
                  placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land
                  preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways;
                  nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
                  nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as
                  garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not
                  exempt from any chapter requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means
                  the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration
                  affects the external dimensions of the building.
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or
                  liquid storage tank.
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development.
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
                  structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
                  before the damage occurred.
                  Substantial improvement.
                  (1)
                  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of
                  a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of
                  the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of
                  the structure should be:
                  a.
                  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or
                  b.
                  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
                  This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair
                  work performed.
                  (2)
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  245/426
                  For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first
                  alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
                  alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include:
                  a.
                  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary,
                  or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been
                  identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or
                  b.
                  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued
                  designation as a historic structure.
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction,
                  rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the
                  streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner
                  otherwise prohibited by this chapter.
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's
                  floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other
                  certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such
                  time as that documentation is provided.

                  thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this chapter.
                  (b)
                  For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS for the county,
                  dated June 18, 2010, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are hereby
                  adopted by reference.
                  (c)
                  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through
                  standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS.

                  The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
                  based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be
                  increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood
                  hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not
                  create liability on the part of the county board of commissioners or by any officer or employee thereof for any
                  flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

                  the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. Â§ 5-4-1.
                  (d)
                  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the
                  proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
                  the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
                  (e)
                  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided
                  the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods
                  that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
                  (f)
                  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
                  discharge would result.
                  (g)
                  In reviewing such requests, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all
                  standards specified in this section and other sections of this chapter.
                  (h)
                  Conditions for variances.
                  (1)
                  A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  a.
                  A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.
                  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
                  c.
                  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
                  public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
                  conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
                  (2)
                  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the
                  standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
                  minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a
                  determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of
                  the building.

                  (3)
                  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the
                  base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance
                  will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor
                  elevation.
                  (4)
                  The county zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the
                  Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
                  (i)
                  Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsection (h) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the
                  board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
                  purposes of this chapter.

                  ARTICLE III. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
                  Sec. 107-70. - General standards.
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required:
                  (1)
                  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
                  collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
                  (2)
                  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and
                  utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
                  (3)
                  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and
                  practices that minimize flood damage.
                  (4)
                  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully
                  enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so
                  as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood
                  forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
                  a.
                  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or
                  meet the following minimum criteria:
                  1.
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  252/426
                  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot
                  of enclosed area subject to flooding;
                  2.
                  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  3.
                  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the
                  automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
                  b.
                  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall
                  only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the
                  premises, or entry to the elevated area; and
                  c.
                  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
                  (5)
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
                  plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
                  accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
                  (6)
                  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring
                  may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
                  addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces.
                  (7)
                  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
                  into the system.
                  (8)
                  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
                  floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
                  (9)
                  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination
                  from them during flooding.
                  (10)
                  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions
                  of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
                  (Code 2000, Â§ 34-91; Ord. of 5-5-1997, art. 4, Â§ A; Ord. of 7-6-2010, art. 4, Â§ A)

                  253/426
                  Sec. 107-71. - Specific standards.
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required:
                  (1)
                  New construction and/or substantial improvements.
                  a.
                  Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or
                  manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the
                  base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient
                  to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in
                  accordance with standards of section 107-70(4).
                  b.
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
                  plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation.
                  (2)
                  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in
                  A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility
                  and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls
                  substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting
                  hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
                  shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice
                  for meeting the provisions of this section, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above
                  and in section 107-47(a)(7).
                  (3)
                  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
                  a.
                  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on:
                  1.
                  Individual lots or parcels;
                  2.
                  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
                  3.
                  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
                  4.
                  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred
                  substantial damage as the result of a flood;
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  254/426
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
                  b.
                  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
                  may be elevated so that either:
                  1.
                  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood
                  elevation; or
                  2.
                  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at
                  least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
                  c.
                  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
                  flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See section 107-70(6).)
                  d.
                  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  1.
                  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
                  2.
                  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on
                  its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and
                  has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
                  3.
                  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and
                  elevation requirements of subsection (3)a. and c. of this section.
                  (4)
                  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 107-6 are areas designated as
                  floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion
                  potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base
                  flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
                  a.
                  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other
                  development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is
                  demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
                  practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base
                  flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification
                  thereof.

                  255/426
                  b.
                  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall
                  comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

                  ARTICLE III. - ZONING POWER STANDARDS
                  Sec. 109-40. - Zoning ordinance amendments.
                  The planning and zoning commission and the board of county commissioners will, when considering a proposed
                  amendment to the zoning ordinance, first determine whether the limitation imposed by such an amendment, if
                  any, on the right to unrestricted use of property which might result from the proposed amendment is necessary to
                  promote the public health, safety, morality or general welfare. In considering whether to recommend a change in
                  the zoning classification of any particular property, the planning and zoning commission will balance the benefit
                  to the public of the present zoning classification of the property against the detriment to the property owner, and
                  scrutinize the application in light of the character of the land in question and the effect of the zoning decision
                  upon the property owner's rights. In making these determinations, the following standards must be considered:
                  (1)
                  The existing land uses and zoning classification of nearby property.
                  (2)
                  The suitability of the property for the proposed rezoning.
                  (3)
                  The length of time the property has been vacant.
                  (4)
                  The threat to the public health, safety, morality, and welfare if rezoned.
                  (5)
                  The extent to which the value of the subject property is diminished by the present zoning, as compared to its
                  potential value under the proposed zoning.
                  (6)
                  The balance between the hardship on the property owner and the benefit to the public in not rezoning.
                  (7)
                  Whether the subject property has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned.
                  (8)
                  Whether the proposed zoning will be a use that is suitable in view of the uses and development of nearby
                  property or will adversely affect the existing use or usability of nearby property.
                  (9)
                  Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which
                  give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal.
                  (10)
                  Whether the zoning proposal is in conformity with the policies and intent of the land use plan.

                  (11)
                  Whether the zoning proposal would overburden the public utilities, schools, and streets presently existing to
                  serve the site.
                  (12)
                  Whether the zoning proposal would have a substantial adverse impact on the environment, including, but not
                  limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality, and water quality and quantity.

                  (3)
                  All persons desiring to be heard orally may present their views at the hearing. The length of time of oral
                  presentations permitted to each speaker will be determined by the planning and zoning commission and
                  governed by the planning and zoning commission chairperson, depending upon the number of persons present
                  and desiring to speak. Remarks of a personal nature will not be tolerated.
                  (4)
                  The applicant is allowed to respond to any issues that are raised.

                  Sec. 109-103. - Membership and appointments.
                  The planning and zoning commission consists of at least three but no more than five members. All members
                  must reside within the county and shall be appointed by the board of county commissioners. None of the
                  members of the planning and zoning commission may hold any elected public office except that one member
                  may also be a member of the county board of appeals. Commission members may be removed by the board of
                  county commissioners for cause, upon written charges, and after a public hearing. Members of the planning and
                  zoning commission will be disqualified to act upon any matter before the planning and zoning commission in
                  which they have a personal financial interest or other conflict of interest.

                  262/426
                  The term of office for each member of the planning and zoning commission is for three years. However, in the
                  appointment of the first commission, two members will be appointed for three years, two for two years, and one
                  for one year. Any vacancy in the membership will be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the
                  initial appointment. If one appointee is from the county board of appeals and he ceases to be a member of the
                  board of appeals during the term of his appointment to the planning and zoning commission, his membership in
                  the planning and zoning commission will terminate and the board of county commissioners may name another
                  member of the planning and zoning commission to fill the unexpired term of its original appointee.

                  Planning and zoning commission members will receive compensation for their service as determined by the
                  board of county commissioners.

                  (a)
                  The planning and zoning commission will elect one of its members as chairperson. The chairperson will serve

                  (b)
                  The planning and zoning commission will appoint a secretary, who may be an officer of the county or the
                  planning and zoning commission.
                  (c)
                  A planning and zoning commission quorum shall be three members.
                  (d)
                  Unless otherwise stated in this section, the planning and zoning commission will follow Robert's Rules of Order,
                  Newly Revised, when holding its meetings. The planning and zoning commission has the authority to change its
                  rules of procedure.
                  (e)
                  Meetings of the planning and zoning commission will be held at the call of the chairperson, or, in his absence,
                  the acting chairperson.
                  (f)
                  The chairperson or the acting chairperson may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses by
                  subpoena. The planning and zoning commission must keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each
                  member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact. The planning and zoning
                  commission must also keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which must be
                  immediately filed in the office of the planning and zoning commission and will be public record.
                  (g)
                  A decision of the planning and zoning commission must be recorded in the minutes for the meeting at which the
                  decision was made, and must contain a statement of the grounds of its decision or action.

                  263/426
                  (h)
                  No application for the same property will be received or heard by the planning and zoning commission twice
                  within the same six-month period. However, that limitation does not affect the right of the planning and zoning
                  commission to grant a rehearing as provided in the rules and procedures adopted by the planning and zoning
                  commission.

                  Sec. 109-107. - Appealing an action of the planning and zoning commission.
                  (a)
                  If the planning and zoning commission executes an action which the developer or other aggrieved party believes
                  to be contrary to law, that action may be appealed. Findings of fact, however, may not be appealed.
                  Recommendations on ordinance amendments are not actions. Such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the
                  date on which the action by the planning and zoning commission was taken.
                  (b)
                  The board of appeals has jurisdiction for hearing appeals concerning actions of the planning and zoning
                  commission related to this article. Applications for appeal may be submitted to the administrative officer, who
                  will transmit them to the board of appeals for its consideration.
                  (c)
                  When an action of the administrative officer or planning and zoning commission is appealed, all construction or
                  other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however, the
                  administrative officer may feel that the stopping of such construction or other activity authorized by the appealed
                  action will cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the administrative officer may certify to the
                  board of appeals that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction or other activity
                  authorized by the appealed action would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the
                  construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action is allowed to continue unless a restraining order
                  is granted by either the board of appeals or a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
                  (d)
                  When an application for appeal of an action of the planning and zoning commission is received, the board of
                  appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in
                  two consecutive issues in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, the first insertion being at least 15
                  days before the hearing. In addition, the parties to the appeal will be notified of the date of the hearing by the
                  board of appeals by first class mail at least 15 days before the hearing. Any person may appear at the hearing, or
                  have a representative attend instead.
                  (e)
                  The board of appeals will make a decision concerning the appeal and record the decision in the minutes for that
                  meeting. Further appeal on points of law may be made to the superior court of the county.

                  Such minor land disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance
                  work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion;
                  (4)
                  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part
                  of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre
                  and not otherwise exempted under this subsection; provided, however, that construction of any such residence
                  shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6 and this subsection. For singlefamily residence construction covered by the provisions of this subsection, there shall be a buffer zone between
                  the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of the Georgia
                  Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land disturbing activity shall be constructed between the
                  residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks
                  of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance
                  to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal
                  feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary
                  or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs,
                  the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum
                  requirements of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this subsection shall be enforced by the
                  local issuing authority;
                  (5)
                  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. Â§ 1-3-3, to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of
                  the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the
                  production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for
                  use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees,
                  fowl, or animals; the production of aquaculture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian
                  products; farm buildings and farm ponds;
                  (6)
                  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry
                  practices cause or result in land disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in
                  section 113-27(15) and (16), no other land disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices,
                  shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three
                  years after completion of such forestry practices;
                  (7)
                  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
                  of the United States Department of Agriculture;
                  (8)
                  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not
                  apply to any land disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned
                  disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for
                  purposes of this subsection, the term "state waters" excludes channels and drainageways which have water in
                  them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them
                  year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre,
                  which involves a land disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or
                  drainageway, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project

                  275/426
                  is located, and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from
                  regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by subsection (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) or
                  (10) of this section;
                  (9)
                  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the
                  department of transportation, the state highway authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road
                  construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that
                  construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road and tollway authority
                  which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-7.1; except
                  where the department of transportation, the state highway authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a
                  secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state
                  general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the
                  local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set
                  forth in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as
                  violations by permit holders;
                  (10)
                  Any land disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system
                  or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the
                  regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in

                  Sec. 113-25. - General provisions.
                  Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if
                  requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land
                  disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  276/426
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into
                  the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control
                  measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of sections 113-26 and 113-27. The
                  application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility
                  installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to
                  prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in
                  accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit.

                  Sec. 113-26. - Minimum requirements/BMPs.
                  (a)
                  Best management practices as set forth in this section and section 113-27 shall be required for all land disturbing
                  activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete
                  defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b) of this
                  section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant
                  to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this section, the terms "proper
                  design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained
                  in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6(b).
                  (b)
                  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly
                  designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a
                  local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-30(f),
                  the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of
                  receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm
                  water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The
                  turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director.
                  This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes
                  which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such
                  construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
                  (c)
                  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land
                  disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division
                  pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure
                  occurs.
                  (d)
                  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent
                  monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
                  (e)
                  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in section 113-27(15) and
                  (16), in light of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6(c).

                  purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as
                  the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices
                  to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent
                  than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the
                  Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing
                  activity was permitted, as well as the following:
                  (1)
                  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to
                  minimize erosion;
                  (2)
                  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)
                  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion
                  potential;
                  (4)
                  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)
                  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
                  (6)
                  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)
                  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
                  (8)
                  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
                  (9)
                  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins,
                  silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is
                  stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-
                  1 et seq.;
                  (10)
                  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or
                  the sloping of fills;
                  (11)

                  278/426
                  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  (12)
                  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect
                  other property owners;
                  (13)
                  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are
                  not feasible; provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
                  (14)
                  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for
                  treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments
                  on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 113-26(b);
                  (15)
                  Except as provided in subsection (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all
                  state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow
                  or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural
                  resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-2-8, or where
                  a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control
                  measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral
                  stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances
                  has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located
                  above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff
                  from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the
                  buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-440 et seq., the "Georgia Water Quality
                  Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The
                  following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
                  a.
                  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the
                  final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective
                  vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient
                  quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family
                  residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may
                  thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water
                  quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and
                  b.
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as
                  measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of
                  disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated
                  into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:

                  (16)
                  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested
                  by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant
                  to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-440 et seq., the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage
                  structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams
                  which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may
                  be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance
                  promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the
                  landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a
                  variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are
                  incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply
                  to such buffer:
                  a.
                  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the
                  final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective
                  vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient
                  quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family
                  residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may
                  thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water
                  quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and
                  b.
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as
                  measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of
                  disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated
                  into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
                  1.
                  Stream crossings for water lines; or
                  2.
                  Stream crossings for sewer lines.

                  Sec. 113-48. - Application requirements.
                  (a)
                  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county without
                  first obtaining a permit from the county planning and zoning department to perform such activity and providing a
                  copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
                  (b)
                  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the county planning and zoning department and must include
                  the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans
                  shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 113-49. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control
                  plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed
                  will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of sections 113-26 and 113-27 will be met. Applications
                  for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation
                  and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the
                  designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10 (Ga.
                  Comp. Rules and Regs. Â§ 391-3-7-.10).
                  (c)
                  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-23(a)(5), provided
                  that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and
                  paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity
                  included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to
                  issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-8(a), half
                  of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is
                  required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division,
                  regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
                  (d)
                  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the
                  application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the

                  281/426
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days
                  of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The
                  results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the
                  plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 113-27(15) and (16) have been
                  obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (f) of this section, has been obtained.
                  Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement
                  which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the
                  application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or
                  disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan
                  review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
                  (e)
                  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and
                  Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration,
                  the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
                  (f)
                  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security,
                  cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or
                  fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not
                  comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call
                  the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of
                  the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect
                  an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the
                  local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.

                  within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for
                  denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
                  (c)
                  Any land disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this
                  chapter, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division

                  The county planning and zoning department will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for
                  which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan
                  and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local
                  issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state
                  general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management
                  practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be
                  responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is

                  where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a
                  person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions,
                  or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice
                  shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures
                  must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified,
                  he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter.

                  (a)
                  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this chapter, the director or the local issuing authority
                  shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the

                  requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred;
                  provided, however, that if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if
                  the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local
                  issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning.
                  (b)
                  For the third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate
                  stop work order.

                  must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified,
                  he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have
                  forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 113-48(f). The local
                  issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a
                  contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.

                  is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and
                  meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission present on
                  site whenever land disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any
                  land-disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an
                  owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit.

                  (a)
                  The county, through its zoning office or building inspector, shall require an application for a permit before the
                  issuance of a permit for cable installation. The application shall identify the county rights-of-way affected and

                  of county public roads. The annual fee shall be applied on a yearly basis for the permit issued under this article
                  and shall be as established by the board of commissioners from time to time, and calculated per mile. Annual
                  fees shall be prorated from the date of issuance of the permit to December 30 of the year issued and the amount
                  so determined shall be due upon issuance of the permit. For permits issued on or after December 1 of any year,
                  the fee for the ensuing year shall also be due upon issuance of the permit. Thereafter, the annual fee amount shall
                  be due on January 1 of each year. All annual fees shall be paid within 30 days after their due date. Fees shall be
                  calculated to the nearest 0.01 mile. Annual fees shall continue to be due each year so long as the property on
                  which the cable is located remains a county public road right-of-way or until such cable is abandoned as
                  evidenced by written notification to the county.

                  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the county's authority concerning the placement, construction and
                  modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. The county finds that wireless telecommunications
                  facilities may pose significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character and environment of the

                  county and its inhabitants. The county also recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service
                  technology can be an economic development asset to the citizens of the county and of significant benefit to the
                  county and its residents. In order to ensure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless
                  telecommunications facilities is consistent with the county's land use policies, the county board of
                  commissioners is adopting a single, comprehensive wireless telecommunications facilities application and permit
                  process. The intent of this article is to minimize impact of wireless telecommunications facilities, establish a fair
                  and efficient process for review and approval of applications, ensure an integrated, comprehensive review of the
                  visual and environmental impacts of such facilities, and protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of
                  the county.

                  292/426
                  Requiring, promoting and encouraging, wherever possible, the placement, height and quantity of wireless
                  telecommunications facilities in such a manner, including but not limited to the use of stealth technology, to
                  minimize adverse aesthetic and visual impacts on the land, property, buildings, and other facilities adjacent to,
                  surrounding, and in generally the same area as the requested location of such wireless telecommunications
                  facilities, which shall mean using the least visually and physically intrusive facility that is not technologically or
                  commercially impracticable under the facts and circumstances.
                  (b)
                  In granting a tall structure permit or co-location permit, the county board of commissioners has found that the
                  facility shall be the most appropriate site as regards being the least visually intrusive among those available in
                  the county.
                  (Ord. of 4-20-2009, Â§ 5)

                  those of the applicant as regards the load and stress created on the tower, and located as close to the applicant's
                  antenna as possible without causing interference. A claim of interference because of a need to have greater than
                  six feet of vertical clearance between facilities, measured from the vertical centerline of one array to the vertical
                  centerline of another, must be proven by technical data and not merely verbal or written assertions. This
                  requirement may be waived, provided that the applicant, in writing, demonstrates that the provisions of future
                  shared usage of the tower is not technologically feasible, is commercially impracticable or creates an
                  unnecessary and unreasonable burden, based upon:
                  a.
                  The kind of wireless telecommunications facilities site and structure proposed;
                  b.

                  c.
                  The need for more than six feet of vertical clearance between antenna arrays, measured from the vertical
                  centerline of one array to the vertical centerline of another, such that there would not be adequate vertical space
                  to accommodate a total of four carriers.
                  (9)
                  The owner of a proposed new tower, and his successors in interest, shall negotiate in good faith for the shared
                  use of the proposed tower by other wireless service providers in the future, and shall:
                  a.
                  Respond within 60 days to a request for information from a potential shared-use applicant and a copy of the
                  request shall be provided to the county;
                  b.
                  Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared use of the new tower by other telecommunications
                  providers;
                  c.
                  Allow shared use of the new tower if another telecommunications provider agrees in writing to pay reasonable
                  charges. The charges may include, but are not limited to, a pro rata share of the cost of site selection, planning,
                  project administration, land costs, site design, construction and maintenance financing, return on equity, less
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  301/426
                  depreciation, and all of the costs of adapting the tower or equipment to accommodate a shared user without
                  causing electromagnetic interference;
                  d.
                  Failure to abide by the conditions outlined in this subsection (n)(9) may be grounds for revocation of the tall
                  structure permit or co-location permit.
                  (o)
                  The applicant shall provide certification with documentation (i.e., structural analysis) including calculations that
                  the telecommunications facility tower and foundation and attachments, rooftop support structure, water tank
                  structure, and any other supporting structure as proposed to be utilized are designed and will be constructed to
                  meet all local, state and federal structural requirements for loads, including wind and ice loads and including, but
                  not limited to, all applicable ANSI (American National Standards Institute) guidelines.
                  (p)
                  All proposed wireless telecommunications facilities shall contain a demonstration that the facility be sited so as
                  to create the least visual intrusiveness reasonably possible given the facts and circumstances involved, and
                  thereby have the least adverse visual effect on the environment and its character, on existing vegetation, and on
                  the residences in the area of the wireless telecommunications facility. The county board of commissioners
                  expressly reserves the right to require the use of stealth or camouflage technology or techniques such as DAS
                  (distributive antenna system technology) or its functional equivalent to achieve this goal and such shall be
                  subject to approval by the county board of commissioners.

                  regarding RF radiation, that section or portion must be barricaded with a suitable warning barrier to discourage
                  approaching into the area in excess of the FCC's regulations, and be marked off with yellow and black striped
                  warning tape or a suitable warning barrier, as well as placing RF radiation signs as needed and appropriate to
                  warn individuals of the potential danger;

                  To protect the nature and character of the area and create the least visually intrusive impact reasonably possible
                  under the facts and circumstances, for any attachment to a building or other structure with a facie, the antennas
                  shall be mounted on the facie, unless it can be proven that such will prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the
                  provision of service, and all such attachments and exposed cabling shall use camouflage or stealth techniques to
                  match as closely as possible the color and texture of the structure to which such equipment is attached.

                  (k)
                  If attaching to a water tank, mounting on the top of the tank or the use of a corral shall only be permitted if the
                  applicant can prove that to locate elsewhere will prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of
                  service. The provisions of subsection (j) of this section shall also apply to any attachment to a water tank.
                  (l)
                  The applicant shall provide a certification by a professional engineer licensed in the state, along with
                  documentation (a structural analysis), including calculations, that prove that the tower or other structure and its
                  foundation as proposed to be utilized are designed and were constructed to meet all local state, federal and ANSI
                  structural requirements for loads, including wind and ice loads and the placement of any equipment on the roof a
                  building after the addition of the proposed new facilities.
                  (m)
                  If the application is to attach to or modify existing facilities on a tower, the applicant shall provide signed
                  documentation of the tower condition; specifically a report done pursuant to the latest edition of ANSI-EIA/TIA
                  222F (or 222G if adopted by the state) - Annex E for any self-supporting tower that is five years old or older or
                  for a guyed tower that is three years old or older. Any deficiencies, other than strictly cosmetic ones, must be
                  completed or remedied prior to the issuance of a building permit for the attachment of any component of the
                  proposed wireless facilities.

                  So as to be the least visually intrusive reasonably possible given the facts and circumstances involved, and
                  thereby have the least adverse visual effect and create the least intrusive or lowest profile or visual silhouette
                  reasonably possible, unless it can be proven that such would be technologically impracticable, all antennas
                  attached to a tower or other structure shall be flush-mounted or as near to flush-mounted as is possible without
                  prohibiting or having the effect of prohibiting the provision of service, or prove technically, with hard data and a
                  detailed narrative, that flush mounting can not be used and would serve to prohibit or have the effect of
                  prohibiting the provision of service.
                  (o)
                  Unless it is deemed inappropriate or unnecessary by the county given the facts and circumstances, the applicant
                  shall demonstrate and provide in writing and/or by drawing how it shall effectively screen from view the base
                  and all related equipment and structures of the proposed wireless telecommunications facility up to a height of
                  ten feet.
                  (p)
                  The wireless telecommunications facility and any and all accessory or associated facilities shall maximize the
                  use of building materials, colors and textures designed to blend with the structure to which it may be affixed
                  and/or to harmonize with the natural surroundings. This shall include the utilization of stealth, camouflage or
                  concealment technology as may be required by the county and as is not impracticable under the facts and
                  circumstances.
                  (q)
                  All utilities installed for a new wireless telecommunications facility shall be installed underground and in
                  compliance with all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of the county, including specifically, but not limited
                  to, the National Electrical Safety Code and the National Electrical Code where appropriate.

                  309/426
                  If deemed necessary or appropriate, an access road, turnaround space and parking shall be provided to assure
                  adequate emergency and service access. Maximum use of existing roads, whether public or private, shall be
                  made to the extent practicable. Road construction shall at all times minimize ground disturbance and the cutting
                  of vegetation. Road grades shall closely follow natural contours to ensure minimal visual disturbance and reduce
                  soil erosion and shall comply with any local or state regulations for the construction of roads. If the facility
                  currently has an access road or turnaround space, but such is deemed in disrepair or in need of remedial work to
                  make it serviceable and safe and in compliance with any applicable regulations, the application shall contain a
                  commitment to remedy or restore the road or turnaround space so that it is serviceable and safe and in
                  compliance with applicable regulations.
                  (s)
                  The applicant, and the owner of record of any structure or tower attached to, shall, jointly or separately, at its cost
                  and expense, be required to place with the county a bond, or other form of security acceptable to the county as to
                  type of security and the form and manner of execution, in an amount of at least $25,000.00 for attaching to an
                  existing structure or existing tower and with such sureties as are deemed sufficient by the county to ensure the
                  faithful performance of the terms and conditions of this law and conditions of any tall structure permit or colocation permit issued pursuant to this law. Said bond or other security shall also serve as a removal security to
                  prevent the taxpayers from bearing the cost of removal in the event of the abandonment or cessation of use for
                  more than 90 consecutive days. The full amount of the bond or security shall remain in full force and effect
                  throughout the term of the tall structure permit or co-location permit and/or until any necessary site restoration is
                  completed to restore the site to a condition comparable to that which existed prior to the issuance of the original
                  tall structure permit or co-location permit.

                  (a)
                  Applicants for wireless telecommunications facilities shall locate, site and erect said wireless
                  telecommunications facilities in accordance with the following priorities, with subsection (a)(1) of this section
                  being the highest priority and subsection (a)(5) of this section being the lowest priority:
                  (1)
                  On publicly-owned properties or facilities.
                  (2)
                  On existing towers or other structures without increasing the height of the tower or structure.
                  (3)
                  On properties in any areas zoned for business use.
                  (4)
                  On properties in any areas zoned for agricultural use.
                  (5)
                  On properties in any areas zoned for residential use.

                  310/426
                  If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed in subsection (a) of this section, then a detailed
                  explanation and justification must be provided as to why a site of a higher priority designation was not selected.
                  The person seeking such an exception must satisfactorily demonstrate the reason why such a permit should be
                  granted for the proposed site, and the hardship that would be incurred by the applicant if the permit were not
                  granted for the wireless facility as proposed.
                  (c)
                  An applicant may not bypass sites of higher priority by stating the site proposed is the only site leased or selected
                  or because there is an existing lease with a landowner. An application shall address co-location as an option. If
                  such option is not proposed, the applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the county why colocation is commercially impracticable or otherwise impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting or
                  prohibiting co-location shall not be a valid basis for any claim of commercial impracticability or hardship.
                  (d)
                  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (c) of this section, the county board of commissioners
                  may approve any site located within an area in the list of priorities provided in subsection (a) of this section,
                  provided that the board of commissioners finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety
                  and welfare of the county and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of
                  the community and neighborhood. Conversely, the board of commissioners may direct that the proposed location
                  be changed to another location that is more in keeping with the goals of this article and the public interest as
                  determined by the board of commissioners.
                  (e)
                  If appropriate, based on selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed written explanation as to why sites of a
                  higher priority were not selected shall be included with the application, including the technical justification for
                  such.
                  (f)
                  Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of highest priority or highest available priority,
                  the county board of commissioners may disapprove an application for any of the following reasons:
                  (1)
                  Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
                  (2)
                  Conflict with the historic nature or character of a neighborhood or district;
                  (3)
                  The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities which is contrary to an already stated purpose
                  of a specific zoning or land use designation;
                  (4)
                  The placement and location of wireless telecommunications facilities which would create an unacceptable risk,
                  or the reasonable probability of such, to residents, the public, employees and agents of the county, or employees
                  of the service provider or other service providers;

                  311/426
                  The placement and location of a wireless telecommunications facility would result in a conflict with,
                  compromise in or change of the nature or character of the surrounding area;
                  (6)
                  Conflicts with the provisions of this article;

                  Failure to submit a complete application as required under this article.
                  (g)
                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, for good cause shown, such as the ability to utilize a
                  shorter or less intrusive facility elsewhere and still accomplish the primary service objective, the county board of
                  commissioners may require the relocation of a proposed site, including allowing for the fact that relocating the
                  site chosen by the applicant may require the use of more than one site to provide substantially the same service if
                  the relocation could result in a less intrusive facility or facilities, singly or in combination, so long as such does
                  not prohibit or serve to prohibit the provision of service.

                  Sec. 115-75. - Shared use of wireless telecommunications facilities and other structures.
                  (a)
                  The county, as opposed to the construction of a new tower, requires wireless facilities to be located on existing
                  towers or other suitable structures without increasing the height of the tower or structure, unless such is proven
                  to be technologically impracticable. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive report inventorying existing
                  towers and other suitable structures within one mile of the location of any proposed new tower, unless the
                  applicant can show that some other distance is more appropriate and reasonable and demonstrate conclusively
                  why an exiting tower or other suitable structure cannot be used.
                  (b)
                  An applicant intending to locate on an existing tower or other suitable structure shall be required to document the
                  intent of the existing owner to permit its use by the applicant.
                  (c)
                  Such shared use shall consist only of the minimum antenna array technologically required to provide service
                  primarily and essentially within the county, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.

                  Sec. 115-76. - Height of telecommunications towers.
                  (a)
                  All new towers shall be of the monopole type, unless such is able to be proven to be technologically
                  impracticable. No new towers of a lattice or guyed type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise expressly
                  granted.

                  312/426
                  The applicant shall submit documentation justifying the technical need by the service provider for the total
                  height of any tower, facility and/or antenna requested and the basis therefor. To enable verification of the need
                  for the requested height, documentation in the form of propagation studies must include all backup data used to
                  produce the studies at the height requested and at a minimum of ten feet lower height. Such documentation will
                  be analyzed in the context of the justification of the height needed to provide service primarily and essentially
                  within the county, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.
                  (c)
                  The maximum permitted total height of a new tower shall be 120 feet above pre-construction ground level,
                  unless it can be proven that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service
                  in the intended service area. The 120-foot maximum permitted height is not as-of-right height, but rather the
                  maximum permitted height, absent proof of the technological need for a greater height.
                  (d)
                  Notwithstanding the 120 feet maximum permitted height, telecommunications towers and facilities shall be no
                  taller than the minimum height technologically necessary to enable the provision of wireless service coverage or
                  capacity as needed within the county, and only within the county.
                  (e)
                  Spacing or the distance between towers shall be such that the service may be provided without exceeding the
                  maximum permitted height.

                  Sec. 115-77. - Visibility of wireless telecommunications facilities.
                  (a)
                  Wireless telecommunications facilities shall not be artificially lighted or marked, except as required by ordinance
                  or state or federal regulation.
                  (b)
                  Stealth. All new wireless telecommunications facilities, including but not limited to towers, shall utilize stealth
                  or camouflage techniques and technology, unless such can be shown to be either commercially or technologically
                  impracticable.
                  (c)
                  Dual mode. In order to minimize the number of antenna arrays and thus the visual impact, the county may
                  require the use of dual mode antennas to be used, including by two different carriers, unless it can be proven that
                  such will not work technologically and that such would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service.
                  (d)
                  Tower finish/color. Towers shall be galvanized and/or painted with a rust-preventive paint of an appropriate color
                  to harmonize with the surroundings and shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this article.
                  (e)
                  Lighting. If lighting is required, the applicant shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting of as
                  unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is permissible under state and federal regulations. All towers requiring
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  313/426
                  lighting shall be lighted so as to effectively eliminate the ground scatter effect of the lighting and so as to prevent
                  the light from being seen from the ground.
                  (f)
                  Flush mounting. All new or replacement antennas, except omni directional whip antennas, shall be flushmounted on any tower or other structure, unless the applicant can prove that it is technologically impracticable.
                  If not flush-mounted, the antennas shall be attached so as to create smallest profile reasonably possible under the
                  facts and circumstances, unless it can be proven that to do so would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the
                  service.
                  (g)
                  Placement on buildingâFacie. If attached to a building, all antennas shall be mounted on the facie of the
                  building and camouflaged so as to match the color and, if possible, texture of the building or in a manner so as to
                  make the antennas as visually innocuous and undetectable as is possible given the facts and circumstances
                  involved.
                  (h)
                  LightingâPreventing ground scatter effect. For any wireless facility for which lighting is required under the
                  FAA's regulations, or that for any reason has lights attached, all such lighting shall be affixed with technology
                  that enables the light to be seen as intended from the air, but that prevents the ground scatter effect so that it not
                  able to be seen from the ground to a height of at least 12 degrees vertical for a distance of at least one mile in a
                  level terrain situation. Such device must be compliant with or not in conflict with FAA regulations. A physical
                  shield may be used, as long as the light is able to be seen from the air, as intended by the FAA.
                  (i)
                  In the event a tower that is lighted is modified, at the time of the modification the county may require that the
                  tower be retrofitted with the technology set forth in subsection (h) of this section.

                  Sec. 115-78. - Security of wireless telecommunications facilities.
                  All wireless telecommunications facilities and antennas shall be located, fenced or otherwise secured in a manner
                  that prevents unauthorized access. Specifically:
                  (1)

                  (a)
                  The county may hire any consultant and/or expert necessary to assist the county in reviewing and evaluating the
                  application, including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted, and any site inspections.
                  (b)
                  To prevent the taxpayers from having to bear the cost related to the issue of the regulation of wireless
                  telecommunications facilities, an applicant shall deposit with the county funds sufficient to reimburse the county
                  for all reasonable costs of consulting and expert evaluation and consultation to the county or the applicant in
                  connection with the submission and/or review of any application, any lease negotiations, the pre-approval
                  evaluation, and including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted. The initial deposit shall
                  be $8,500.00. The placement of the $8,500.00 deposit with the county shall precede the pre-application meeting
                  or any work being done as regards processing an application. The county will maintain a separate escrow
                  account for all such funds. The county's consultants/experts shall invoice the county for its services in reviewing
                  the application, including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted. If at any time during the
                  process this escrow account has a balance less than $2,500.00, the applicant shall immediately, upon notification
                  by the county, replenish said escrow account so that it has a balance of at least $5,000.00. Such additional escrow
                  funds shall be deposited with the county before any further action or consideration is taken on the application. In
                  the event that the amount held in escrow is more than the amount of the actual invoicing at the conclusion of the
                  project, the remaining balance shall be promptly refunded to the applicant upon written request.

                  deposit as set forth in subsection (b) of this section has not been placed with the county. In the event the escrow
                  deposit minimum balance as set forth in subsection (b) of this section is not maintained, all work on the
                  application shall cease until the deposit is replenished as required.
                  (d)
                  The total amount of the funds needed as set forth in subsection (b) of this section may vary with the scope and
                  complexity of the project, the completeness of the application, necessary discussions with the applicant and other
                  information as may be needed to complete the necessary review, analysis and inspection of any construction or
                  modification.
                  (e)
                  Records of all outside costs associated with the review and permitting process shall be maintained and available
                  for public inspection, in compliance with applicable state law.

                  any facility that increases the height of the structure to which it is to be attached, a public hearing shall be held
                  by the county, notice of which shall be published in the official newspaper (legal organ) of the county no more
                  than 45 days and no less than 15 calendar days prior to the scheduled date of the public hearing. In order that the
                  nearby landowners are aware of the public hearing, the applicant shall notify all landowners within 1,500 feet of
                  any property line of the lot or parcel on which the new wireless telecommunications facilities are proposed to be
                  located and the application shall contain the names and address of all such landowners. Such notification shall be
                  by certified U.S. mail. The applicant shall provide proof in writing of notification to the county. The notices

                  of the request provided for in the application.
                  (b)
                  The county shall schedule the public hearing referred to in subsection (a) of this section once it finds the
                  application is complete and is not required to set a date if the application is not complete. The county, at any
                  stage prior to issuing a tall structure permit or co-location permit, may require such additional information as it
                  deems necessary as such relates to the issue of the siting, construction or modification of a wireless
                  telecommunications facility.

                  of the application and the circumstances, with due regard for the public's interest and need to be involved, and
                  the applicant's desire for a timely action on the application.

                  shall be issued within 30 days after such approval. Except for necessary building permits, and subsequent
                  certificates of compliance, once a tall structure permit or co-location permit has been granted hereunder, no
                  additional permits or approvals from the county, such as site plan or zoning approvals, shall be required by the

                  (1)
                  Wireless telecommunications facilities with a permit have been abandoned (i.e., not used as wireless
                  telecommunications facilities) for a period exceeding 90 consecutive days or a total of 180 days in any 365-day
                  period, except for periods caused by force majeure or acts of God, in which case, repair or removal shall

                  the holder of the tall structure that said wireless telecommunications facilities are to be removed, the county may
                  approve an interim temporary use agreement/permit, such as to enable the sale of the wireless

                  county.
                  (e)
                  If wireless telecommunications facilities are not removed or substantial progress has not been made to remove
                  the wireless telecommunications facilities within 90 days after the permit holder has received notice, then the
                  county may order officials or representatives of the county to remove the wireless telecommunications facilities
                  at the sole expense of the owner or tall structure permit or co-location permit holder.
                  (f)
                  If, the county removes, or causes to be removed, wireless telecommunications facilities, and the owner of the

                  to finished products, storage of bulk
                  materials, natural resource extraction, or
                  any other process that could produce high
                  levels of noise, dust, smoke, odors, or
                  other emissions. Heavy industrial uses
                  have adverse impacts on surrounding
                  areas and should be isolated as much as
                  possible within proximity to the required
                  community facilities.

                  No amendment to the zoning map shall be permitted or shall take effect unless the zoning district is permitted
                  within the comprehensive land use district shown in section 119-95 that is the subject of the proposed zoning
                  map amendment. Nothing in this provision shall prohibit the county commission from amending the

                  ARTICLE III. - GENERAL PROVISIONS
                  Sec. 119-121. - Nonconforming uses, structures and lots.
                  (a)
                  Nonconformities in general.
                  (1)
                  The provisions that protect uses, structures, and lots that lawfully existed prior to the adoption of the ordinance
                  from which this chapter is derived or a subsequent amendment, but no longer conform to the new regulations.
                  The primary intent of the treatment of nonconformity is to allow continuation of these uses, structures and lots
                  until the end of their useful life, while encouraging conformance to the new regulations when it becomes
                  reasonable to do so.
                  (2)
                  Lawful nonconforming uses, structures and lots are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with land uses,
                  structures, and lots that conform to the requirements of the zoning districts in which the nonconformity exists.
                  However, such nonconforming uses, structures, and lots may continue as set forth in this provision.
                  (b)
                  Nonconforming uses.
                  (1)
                  Nonconforming uses, defined. A use or activity which was lawful prior to the adoption or amendment of the
                  ordinance from which this chapter is derived, but which fails, by reason of such adoption or amendment, to
                  conform to the present requirements of the zoning district.
                  (2)
                  Continuance of nonconforming uses. To avoid undue hardship, the lawful but nonconforming use of any
                  structure or land at the time of the enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or any
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  344/426
                  subsequent amendment may be continued even though the use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter,
                  except that the nonconforming use shall not be:
                  a.
                  Changed to another nonconforming use;
                  b.
                  Reestablished after discontinuance for one year;
                  c.
                  Extended except in conformity with this chapter;
                  d.
                  Rebuilt, altered or repaired if not commenced within one year after damage by fire, windstorm or other disaster
                  when the damage exceeds 75 percent of the fair market sales value of the building immediately prior to the
                  damage.
                  (c)
                  Nonconforming structures.
                  (1)
                  Nonconforming structures defined. A nonconforming structure is a structure or building whose size, dimensions,
                  location on a property or other features were lawful prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of the
                  ordinance from which this chapter is derived, but which, by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment, no
                  longer meets or conforms to one or more such requirements of this chapter.
                  (2)
                  Continuance of nonconforming structures. A nonconforming structure may continue to be occupied and used,
                  except that:
                  a.
                  A nonconforming structure shall not be repaired, rebuilt or altered after damage or destruction of 75 percent or
                  more of its fair market value, unless the structure is a residence.
                  b.
                  If a nonconforming residential building or structure suffers damage, the building or structure may be
                  reconstructed and reused as before if commenced within 12 months from the time such damage occurred; a
                  damaged residential building or structure may be reconstructed to its original size and dimensions, even if
                  nonconforming under this chapter, provided that the reconstruction adhere to current building codes and
                  architectural guidelines requirements in effect at the time of reconstruction.
                  (3)
                  A nonconforming structure, which is not a residence, shall not be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its
                  nonconformity, but it may be repaired to the extent necessary to maintain it in a safe and sanitary condition.

                  345/426
                  A nonconforming manufactured structure may be replaced with another nonconforming manufactured structure
                  provided the structure is a residence and meets the current HUD requirements, and the zoning districts heated
                  square footage requirements.
                  (5)
                  The strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any nonconforming structure or part thereof declared to be
                  unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety or health shall be allowed upon order of such
                  official.
                  (d)
                  Nonconforming lots.
                  (1)
                  Nonconforming lots, defined. A lot lawfully existing at the effective date of the ordinance from which this
                  chapter is derived (and not created for the purpose of evading the requirements of this chapter or chapter 105,
                  development standards and regulations) but which fails by reason of the adoption or amendment of the ordinance
                  from which this chapter is derived to conform to the present requirements for area, dimensions, or location of the
                  zoning district.
                  (2)
                  Continuation of nonconforming lots.
                  a.
                  Where the owner of a lot at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or the
                  owner's successor in title thereto does not own sufficient land to enable such person to conform to the
                  dimensional requirements of this chapter, either:
                  1.
                  Such lot may be used as a building site for a single-family residence in a district where residences are permitted;
                  or
                  2.
                  Such lot may be used as a building site for any other use permitted in the zoning district; provided that said lot
                  requirements or building setbacks are not reduced below the minimum specified in the appropriate district by
                  more than 50 percent; and provided that the minimum requirements of the county board of health can be met for
                  lots on septic systems.
                  b.
                  Lot dimensional reductions greater than the 50 percent maximum reduction set forth in this section may be
                  approved upon appeal, provided that:
                  1.
                  The reduction is approved as a variance under the appeals procedure.
                  2.
                  The decreased requirements conform as closely as possible to the required dimensions.

                  346/426
                  (e)
                  Hardships and extenuating circumstances. If the loss or destruction of a nonconforming structure places an
                  extreme hardship, or there are extenuating circumstances that will not allow the rebuild to commence within the
                  12-month allowed timeframe, the owner may apply to the county director of planning for an extension.
                  Extensions are allowed up to 24 months, allowing the owner additional time to place his affairs in order.
                  (f)
                  Enforcement.
                  (1)
                  Intermittent or illegal use. The casual, intermittent, temporary or illegal use of land or buildings shall not be
                  sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use, and the existence of a nonconforming use on part of
                  a lot or tract shall not be construed to establish a nonconforming use on the entire lot or tract.
                  (2)
                  Existence of a nonconforming use. Determination of whether a nonconforming use exists shall be a question of
                  fact and shall be decided by the zoning administrator.
                  (3)
                  Buildings nonconforming in height, area or bulk. A building nonconforming only as to height, area or bulk
                  requirements may be altered or extended, provided such alteration or extension does not increase the degree of
                  nonconformity in any respect.
                  (4)
                  Nonconforming uses not validated. A nonconforming use in violation of a provision of the ordinance which this
                  chapter amends or replaces, shall not be validated by the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is
                  derived.
                  (5)
                  Discontinuance of a nonconforming use. All nonconforming signs, billboards, junkyards and nonconforming
                  uses of land where no buildings are employed in connection with such use of land shall be discontinued.
                  (6)
                  Restoration of local historic properties or contributing buildings in local historic districts. Notwithstanding the
                  limits established in this section, a nonconforming use, structure or building which is designated as a local
                  historic property or which is listed as a contributing structure in a local historic district under the provisions of
                  this Code may be rebuilt after damage by fire, windstorm or other disaster regardless of the extent of damage for
                  the purpose of restoring the original structure.

                  (1)
                  Residents of the dwelling and up to a maximum of one full-time permanent and four temporary employees may

                  (2)
                  The home occupation shall be subordinate and incidental to the residential use of the dwelling and must not

                  The following districts are hereby designated as agricultural: AG and R-R. The following districts are hereby
                  designated as residential: R-2, R-1, RL, and V-P. Each of the aforementioned districts is designed and intended to
                  secure for the persons who reside there a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant environment in which to live,
                  sheltered from incompatible and disruptive activities that properly belong in nonresidential districts. Other
                  objectives and purposes of these districts are explained in the following sections of this division. The primary
                  standards for development within each of the following zones are given in division 4 of this article.

                  (a)
                  The purpose of the agricultural (AG) district is to maintain an area of agricultural use and rural character within
                  the county, to preserve a working agricultural economy and rural landscape in these areas, to conserve
                  environmentally sensitive resources, to stabilize and protect single-family characteristics of the district, and to
                  promote and encourage a suitable environment for family life.

                  (b)
                  Application of this zone will ensure that the farming, pasture, and forestry uses, and the scenic values associated
                  with these and the single-family residential character of these areas are protected from incompatible development
                  that could result in the degradation of these values. For all major subdivisions of land for residential purposes in
                  this district, conservation design is required leaving large amounts of land in agricultural use or as natural green
                  space protected by conservation easement. Recreational, institutional, and limited commercial uses are also
                  appropriate for these districts as provided in the table of uses in section 119-269

                  The purpose of the R-R Rural Residential District is to provide for single-family residential development of low
                  density (not more than one principal dwelling unit per three acres) to achieve and maintain a rural landscape
                  character. The district is intended to accommodate such public buildings, schools, churches, public recreational
                  facilities, accessory uses, and environmental resources as may be necessary or are normally compatible with
                  rural density and low-intensity agriculture. The district is not intended to accommodate intense or industrialscale agriculture. For all major subdivisions of land for residential purposes in this district, conservation
                  subdivision design is required leaving large amounts of land in agricultural use or as natural green space
                  protected by conservation easement. The R-R district is designed to accommodate development in areas not
                  served by public water and sewer utilities.

                  The R-2 Single-Family Residential District is intended to provide for single-family residential development at
                  low-intensity (not over one principal dwelling unit per two acres) along with such public buildings, schools,
                  churches, recreational facilities and accessory uses as may be necessary to support such communities and are
                  normally compatible with such surroundings. For all major subdivisions of land for residential purposes in this
                  district, conservation design is required leaving large amounts of land as green space protected by conservation
                  easement. The R-2 district is designed to accommodate development in areas not served by public water and
                  sewer utilities.

                  The R-1 Single-Family Residential District is intended for single-family residential development at low-density
                  (not over one principal dwelling unit per 1.2 acres) along with such public buildings, schools, churches,
                  recreational facilities and accessory uses as may be necessary to support such communities and that are normally
                  compatible with such surroundings. For all major subdivisions of land for residential purposes in this district,
                  conservation subdivision design is required leaving large amounts of land as green space protected by
                  conservation easement. The R-1 district may be applied in areas not served by public water and sewer utilities at
                  a density of one principal dwelling unit per 1.2 acres. This district is also applicable at a maximum density of
                  one dwelling unit per 0.7 acre in areas only if public or private community water and sewer utilities are available
                  to support such density.

                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  352/426
                  Purpose. The RL Residential Lake Districts are intended for single-family residential development at varying
                  densities from one dwelling per 0.115 acre in RL-1, one dwelling per one-half acre in RL-2, to one dwelling per
                  acre in the RL-3 district along with such public buildings, recreational facilities and accessory uses as may be
                  necessary to support such communities and that is normally compatible with such surroundings. The RL districts
                  are designed to accommodate development in areas adjoining Jackson Lake served by public or community
                  water systems but may not be served by public sewer utilities. The district is intended to apply to existing lots
                  and dwellings that may have been developed prior to adoption of county zoning and subdivision regulations in
                  order to apply basic standards for protection of property values and to protect the public health, safety, and
                  welfare while placing most of such properties in a conforming status with respect to zoning. The district is also
                  intended for application only in areas adjacent and in close proximity to major bodies of water where both water
                  and sewer utilities are installed and readily accessible.
                  (b)
                  Status of existing nonconforming lots and utilities in RL-1, RL-2, and RL-3 districts. Nonconforming lots
                  existing on the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall not be required to have
                  access to public sewer utilities unless such utilities are installed and readily accessible in a public street or
                  easement adjoining any such lot. All lots created in any RL district after the date of adoption of the ordinance
                  from which this chapter is derived shall have access to water and sewerage as approved by the county health
                  department and all other applicable regulations.
                  (c)
                  Residential Lake RL-1 High-Density Residential/Recreation District (RL-1). The RL-1 district provides areas for
                  the higher intensity residential development including the development of second and vacation home properties
                  in the county along the shoreline of Jackson Lake. This district is also intended to accommodate open space,
                  convenience services, and community facilities that compliment higher density living and are appropriate for the
                  recreational theme of lakeside living.
                  (d)
                  Residential Lake RL-2 Medium-Density Residential/Recreation District (RL-2). The RL-2 district is intended to
                  provide opportunities for a cohesive mix of dwelling units to diversify the types of housing located in the
                  vicinity of the Jackson Lake shoreline in the county while preserving the lake and its unique wildlife habitats,
                  environment, and natural resources. Residential medium-density districts provide for a moderate intensity of use
                  and should therefore serve as transitional areas between less intense uses such as low-density residential districts
                  and higher intensity areas.
                  (e)
                  Residential Lake RL-3 Low-Density Residential/Recreation District (RL-3). The purpose of the RL-3 district is to
                  encourage the development of single-family residential neighborhoods, and certain uses allied to or customarily
                  incidental to traditional residential developments while stressing the preservation of the natural beauty of the
                  lakeshore line and surrounding land. This district is appropriately located in areas adjacent to Jackson Lake.

                  Sec. 119-199. - V-P Village Plan Mixed-Use Residential District.
                  (a)
                  Purposes. The V-P Village Plan Mixed-Use Residential District is designed and intended to promote
                  development of neighborhoods in the traditional pattern with a mixture of single-family detached dwellings at
                  moderate density (up to seven units per acre) and attached or multifamily housing at greater density (up to 17
                  units per acre) along with such limited commercial buildings, public buildings, recreational facilities and

                  353/426
                  accessory uses as may be necessary to support such a complete village community and that are normally
                  compatible with such surroundings.
                  (b)
                  The V-P district is intended to be applied only in areas identified in the comprehensive plan as neighborhood or
                  community activity centers. All major subdivisions of land in this zoning district require use of the conservation
                  subdivision design method, leaving a portion of the community as natural green space protected by conservation
                  easement. In return for the relatively intense density permitted in this district, all development is intended to be
                  subject to the county architectural standards to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare.
                  (1)
                  To create a distinct physical settlement surrounded by protected green space used for agriculture, silviculture,
                  recreation, and environmental protection purposes.
                  (2)
                  To develop settlements of modest size and scale that accommodate and promote pedestrian travel rather than
                  motor vehicle trips.
                  (3)
                  To promote design that results in residentially scaled buildings fronting on, and aligned with, streets.
                  (4)
                  To encourage the inclusion of a diversity of household types, age groups, and income levels in the county.
                  (5)
                  To promote traditional village building and site development patterns with an interconnected and generally
                  rectilinear pattern of streets, alleys, and blocks, providing for a balanced mix of pedestrians and automobiles, as
                  typically exists in neighborhoods and towns as shown in the county architectural design guidelines.
                  (6)
                  To encourage creation of a functionally diverse, but visually unified, community focused on a central square or
                  green.
                  (7)
                  To promote use of neighborhood greens, landscaped streets, boulevards, parkways, and "single-loaded" streets
                  woven into street and block patterns in order to provide neighborhood identity and space for social activity,
                  parks, and visual enjoyment.
                  (8)
                  To provide buildings for common or institutional purposes, such as civic or religious assembly, that act as visual
                  landmarks and symbols of identity.
                  (9)
                  To promote the location of dwellings, shops, and workplaces in close proximity to each other, the scale of which
                  accommodates and promotes pedestrian travel for trips within the community.

                  (10)
                  To preserve green space, scenic vistas, agricultural lands, and natural areas.
                  (11)
                  To promote environmentally sustainable building and development practices.

                  The C-1 Neighborhood Commercial District is designed to accommodate a limited variety of commerce: those
                  firms and services that are pedestrian-oriented or that serve the needs of nearby residential neighborhoods and
                  farms. The C-1 Neighborhood Commercial District is intended to accommodate smaller scale business firms and
                  commercial services that have a lower impact upon and are compatible with nearby residences in terms of
                  vehicular traffic, noise, odors, lighting, the amount of solid waste produced, and hours of operation.

                  The C-2 General Commercial District is designed to accommodate commercial development on a more intensive
                  scale than the C-1 district. The types of uses permissible in this zone include those kinds of firms and services

                  Density bonuses to further certain public objectives. Village residential density may be increased beyond
                  standard density when certain public objectives pertaining to public land dedication, and conservation land
                  endowments are achieved. The additional dwelling units shall be cumulative, provided that the total additional
                  number of dwelling units under this section shall not exceed 25 percent of the standard density.
                  (1)
                  Public use of green space. A density increase may be granted at the discretion of the county commission where
                  the proposal provides for the dedication of green space for public use (including active and passive recreation
                  areas, municipal sanitary sewerage land application systems, municipal buildings, school sites, etc.) in
                  accordance with the following standards:
                  a.
                  The increase in density shall be computed on the basis of one dwelling unit per five acres of natural resource land
                  including, but not limited to: woodlands, pastures, conservation meadows, farm fields; or per one acre of land
                  improved for active recreation (such as ball fields) or per half-mile of trail that becomes publicly accessible. The
                  density shall not exceed ten percent increase over the standard density.
                  b.
                  The decision whether to accept an applicant's offer to dedicate land to public usage within a proposed village
                  development shall be at the discretion of the county commission, which shall be guided by the recommendations
                  contained in the green space/recreation element of the comprehensive plan.

                  a.
                  A density increase may be granted at the discretion of the county commission when green space is to be donated
                  to a land trust, property owners association, or home owners association up to a maximum of ten percent over
                  standard density, to generate additional income to the recipient for the sole purpose of endowing a permanent
                  fund to offset continuing costs of maintaining the green space, including costs associated with active or passive
                  recreation facilities. Spending from this fund shall be restricted to expenditure of interest so that the principal
                  may be preserved. The estimate of maintenance costs shall be prepared by an agency, firm, or organization
                  acceptable to the county commission, and with experience in managing green space and recreational facilities.
                  The density shall not exceed a maximum ten percent increase over the standard density. In the event that the
                  agency designated to manage the maintenance of the green space fails within its duties, the county will designate
                  the area as a special tax district, to collect revenues to manage and maintain the green space.
                  b.
                  Because additional dwellings, beyond the maximum that would ordinarily be permitted, may reasonably be
                  considered to be net of development costs and represent true profit, 75 percent of the net selling price of the
                  endowment lots shall be donated by the applicant to the green space maintenance endowment fund for
                  maintenance of the lands to be conserved within the subdivision. The developer shall transfer this fund to the
                  designated entity with ownership and maintenance responsibilities. When estimating the projected maintenance
                  costs of the green space, any area that is not accessible to the subdivision residents for their common enjoyment
                  shall not be included in these calculations. Such inaccessible lands shall include areas designated on the final
                  plan as "country properties" and other non-common acreage.
                  (3)
                  Affordable housing development. A density increase may be granted where the proposal provides housing
                  opportunities for low- or moderate-income households. For each affordable housing unit, one additional building
                  lot or dwelling unit shall be permitted, up to a maximum 15 percent increase over the standard density.
                  (4)
                  LEED certification. A density increase may be granted where the proposal provides for houses, commercial or
                  mixed-use buildings meeting LEED Green Building certification up to a maximum of 20 percent increase over
                  the standard density. The increased density may be expressed in terms of the number residential dwelling units
                  permitted or in additional commercial floor area if LEED standards are met for commercial mixed-use buildings.
                  The increases considered shall be as follows:
                  LEED Level Achieved Density Bonus
                  Certification 5%
                  Silver 10%
                  Gold 15%
                  Platinum 20%
                  (5)
                  Implementation. For each of the public purposes described in this section, dwellings resulting from density
                  bonuses may be accommodated by reducing the amount of required green space acreage by up to ten percent,
                  reducing the minimum lot area requirements by up to 20 percent, or by a combination of these approaches,
                  provided that county commission is satisfied that the public purpose objectives are being achieved.

                  (d)
                  Minimum required green space. The minimum amount of green space required shall equal 50 percent of total
                  tract area except as otherwise provided in this chapter. The green space shall be composed of all constrained
                  lands within the total tract area and any additional lands necessary to reach 50 percent of the total tract area
                  according to the following formula:
                  Formula: Required Green Space = 50 percent of Total Tract Area
                  (50% Ã Total Tract Area)
                  â All Constrained Land

                  (1)
                  Villages shall be designed in a generally rectilinear pattern of blocks and interconnecting streets and rear lanes,
                  defined by buildings, landscaping, pedestrian ways, sidewalks and street furniture. To avoid the monotony of a
                  rigid grid layout and to better conform to the natural terrain, streets may include frequent gentle curves.
                  (2)
                  The maximum length of a block shall be 500 feet. This length may be extended up to 800 feet when mid-block

                  (5)
                  Each block that includes storefronts and/or townhouse lots less than 40 feet wide shall be designed to include a
                  rear alley serving parking areas or garages in the rear.
                  (6)
                  Local access streets shall be configured using a design speed of 25 mph. Traffic calming techniques shall include
                  "T" intersections, traffic islands, circles, loops or crescents, roundabouts, three-way and four-way stop signs.
                  Speed bumps shall be avoided. At least 25 percent of local access streets shall terminate in "T" intersections. The

                  ARTICLE V. - OVERLAY DISTRICTS
                  Sec. 119-323. - Overlay districts established; applicability.
                  There are hereby established two overlay district as described in the following sections of this article. The
                  overlay districts are intended to apply additional regulations and standards to supplement the underlying zoning
                  districts when the location and proposed land uses require such regulation to promote the public interest. Overlay
                  districts apply to all land, structures, and land uses that either:
                  (1)
                  Fall within the boundaries of the overlay zone shown on the official zoning maps; or
                  (2)
                  Meet the criteria defined in this chapter.
                  (Ord. of 7-20-2009, Â§ 56)
                  Sec. 119-324. - S-2 Sensitive Land - Watershed Protection Overlay Zone.
                  (a)
                  The purpose of the S-2 district is to protect watersheds, which are vital to public water supplies and therefore
                  have a unique environmental importance to the county; to prevent development from contaminating water
                  sources to a point where they cannot be treated to meet drinking water standards. The S-2 district is intended to
                  maintain a high level of quality for all surface water (rivers, creeks, streams, and springs) and underground
                  water, and to help assure that a high quality of water is maintained in the future. The district is intended to
                  provide for certain permitted uses, and to protect the area from the polluting effects of more intense development
                  and from encroachments of those uses that are not compatible with a protected watershed.
                  (b)
                  The S-2 watershed protection overlay zone applies additional standards to defined watershed areas that may lie
                  within any other zoning district. In each zoning district located within the boundaries of the S-2 district, both the
                  regulations of that underlying district and the regulations of the S-2 overlay district apply. However, the more
                  restrictive standard shall govern.

                  Sec. 119-325. - Applicability and boundaries of S-2 districts.
                  Areas that lie within watersheds, which are vital to area public water supplies and have a unique environmental
                  importance to the county are included within the S-2 district. S-2 districts and their boundaries are delineated on
                  the "S-2 Sensitive Land - Watershed Protection Map," which is made a part of this chapter by reference.

                  (a)
                  Each zoning district of this chapter specifies a list of permitted principal uses, and accessory uses. That list of
                  permitted uses given for each primary zoning district must be adhered to on land to which the S-2 overlay district
                  is also applied. However, the list of prohibited uses given in subsection (b) of this section applies to all S-2 land,
                  regardless in which primary zoning district it lies.

                  (a)
                  The S-2 overlay district applies additional standards to specific areas that may lie within any zoning district. If
                  required development standards are specified for the same item in both district regulations, the more stringent
                  standard governs.
                  (b)
                  The developer/owner must comply with the county soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance set forth in
                  chapter 113, as well as any other applicable development regulations.
                  (c)
                  Any setback measurements stated in this section are measured from and are used only on the side abutting the

                  When a residential use or personal care home is to be located in a zoning district where such use or personal care
                  home requires a public hearing by the planning and zoning commission and approval of the board of
                  commissioners, the following items shall be considered in determining whether the residential use or personal
                  care home shall be approved:

                  Sec. 119-391. - Required buffer areas.
                  Buffer areas shall be established and maintained by the property owner under the following provisions:
                  (1)
                  A 50-foot-wide buffer area which provides visual screening and may be required to provide a screening fence or
                  wall on the interior edge of the buffer shall be established and maintained by the owner in any required side or
                  rear yard when a development in a C-1, C-2 or M district adjoins RR, R-2, R-1, or V-P zoning district. Minimum
                  fence or wall height shall be six feet.
                  (2)
                  The requirements for a fence or wall may be waived by the director of planning upon presentation of field survey
                  analysis prepared by a licensed architect, landscape architect, or engineer demonstrating that construction of the
                  fence or wall would destroy existing vegetation which, in itself, provides visual screening between the
                  development and the adjoining residential district.
                  (3)
                  Required buffer areas shall be maintained as a planted area, using existing vegetation or, when required,
                  additional plantings as provided in this section.
                  (4)
                  Required buffer areas shall be appropriately landscaped with trees and shrubs and may be enhanced with flowers,
                  grass, stone, rocks and other natural landscaping materials.
                  (5)
                  Required buffer areas shall not be used for parking or a structure other than a fence or drainage improvements
                  required by the county. However, a buffer area may be used for vehicular access and utility easements if these
                  are constructed approximately perpendicular to the greater distance of the buffer area. Buffers may also contain
                  drainage improvements required by the county based upon competent engineering studies showing the
                  improvements to be necessary, if approved by the county engineer.

                  396/426
                  Except as otherwise provided, the natural topography of the land shall be preserved and natural growth shall not
                  be disturbed beyond that which is necessary to prevent a nuisance, to thin natural growth where too dense for
                  normal growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen or dangerous and decayed timbers. However, a slope easement
                  may be cleared and graded where required to prevent soil erosion upon approval of the public works director;
                  this easement may cover no more than 20 percent of the required buffer space, and shall be immediately
                  replanted upon completion of easement improvements.
                  (7)
                  Where the conditions described in subsection (6) of this section cannot be met by reason of the topography of the
                  land or due to the prior removal or lack of vegetation and foliage, the owner of the buffer area shall install a
                  permanent screen of evergreen plantings, so designed and developed to provide visual screening between the
                  property described herein. These plantings shall consist of a mix of hardwoods and evergreens indigenous to the
                  state's Piedmont area in order to mirror what is native and will sustain life in the Piedmont area. These plantings
                  shall not be less than six feet in height, or trees or shrubs what will, in normal growth, attain a height of six feet
                  within three years. The following plants are suggested, but not limited to, for this purpose: Southern Magnolia,
                  Eastern Red Cedar, Sassafras, Maple, and Poplar. A certified master gardener, landscape architect, or the UGA
                  Extension Service may be consulted for additional planting recommendations. Other plants may be suitable,
                  provided they can form a hardy screen, dense enough and high enough both to interrupt vision and diffuse the
                  transmission of sound. Plants selected should not be exotic or invasive.
                  (8)
                  Any grading, improvements or construction adjacent thereto shall be conducted far enough from the buffer area
                  so as not to disturb or encroach upon trees within the buffer area.
                  (9)
                  Required buffer areas shall be designated on each subdivision plat, concept plan, or construction plan and shall
                  be recorded as a permanent easement.

                  Standards for approval of communications towers. When a communications tower is to be located in a zoning
                  district where a tower requires a public hearing by the planning and zoning commission and approval of the
                  board of commissioners, the following standards shall be considered in determining whether the tower shall be
                  approved:
                  a.

                  d.
                  Are there other existing or changing conditions that, because of their impact on the public health, safety, morality
                  and general welfare of the community, give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the
                  proposed tower?

                  to mean the county zoning board of appeals. The board shall consist of not more than five members nor less than
                  three members each appointed by majority vote of the board of commissioners. All members shall be citizens of

                  each term expires, the appointment shall be for three years except that a vacancy occurring in an unexpired term
                  shall be filled by appointment for the unexpired portion of that term. The board of commissioners by majority
                  vote shall have the authority to remove any member of the zoning board of appeals but only for cause and upon
                  written charges and after public hearing.

                  showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such facts, and
                  shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the

                  An appeal from a decision of the zoning administrator may be taken to the board by any person aggrieved, or by
                  any officer, department, board or agency of the county affected by such decision. Such appeal shall be taken
                  within a reasonable time by filing with the zoning administrator and with the board a notice of appeal specifying
                  the grounds thereof.
                  (b)
                  The zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which
                  the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from
                  unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him,
                  that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
                  property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order granted by a court of
                  record upon application and notice to the zoning administrator and on due cause shown.

                  b.
                  That the granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a property right and not

                  c.
                  That the condition from which relief or a variance is sought did not result from action by the applicant.
                  d.
                  That the authorizing of the variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or

                  or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding areas, or in any other
                  respect impair the health, safety, comfort, morals or general welfare of the inhabitants of the county.

                  prohibited.
                  (3)
                  Conditional approval. In approving a variance or an appeal, the board may impose special conditions that it
                  deems necessary in order to mitigate impacts, which may be expected without the imposition of those conditions.
                  Such conditions may consist of a variety of requirements, including, but not limited to:

                  The permitted order in which amendments may be made to the text of this chapter, the comprehensive land use
                  plan and the zoning map is as follows:
                  (1)
                  The text of this chapter may be amended without prior or subsequent amendment to comprehensive land use plan
                  or the zoning map.
                  (2)
                  The zoning map may be amended without an amendment to the comprehensive land use plan if the proposed
                  amendment would permit a use that is permitted by the comprehensive land use plan.
                  (3)
                  If a proposed amendment to the zoning map would permit a use that is not authorized within the land use
                  category of the subject property as shown on the comprehensive land use plan, then the applicant must obtain an
                  appropriate amendment to the comprehensive land use plan before applying for the rezoning, or the applicant
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  409/426
                  may apply for an appropriate amendment to the comprehensive land use plan and at the same time apply for a
                  zoning map amendment.
                  (4)
                  The comprehensive land use plan may be amended regardless of the zoning district in which the subject property
                  is located.
                  (5)
                  Where an application to amend the comprehensive land use plan and an application to amend the zoning map
                  each affect the same property and are scheduled to be heard at the same hearing, the application to amend the
                  comprehensive land use plan shall be heard first and action authorized by this chapter taken before the
                  application to amend the zoning map is heard and action taken with respect thereto.

                  Sec. 119-449. - General standards for approval of special uses.
                  Any use shown in the table of permitted uses as requiring a special use permit in any district may be permitted
                  after a hearing by the planning and zoning commission and approval of the board of commissioners. The hearing
                  shall follow all procedures required in section 119-442 for zoning amendments. The following standards shall be
                  considered in determining whether the special use permit shall be approved:
                  (1)
                  Is the proposed use suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property?
                  (2)
                  Does the proposed use adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property?
                  (3)
                  Will the proposed use likely cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities,
                  utilities or other public facilities?
                  (4)
                  Is the subject site itself suitable for the proposed use in terms of area, topography, natural conditions, or existing
                  land uses on the site?
                  (5)
                  Is the proposed use suitable in terms of the natural environment on the site and on adjacent and nearby property?
                  (6)
                  5/30/2019 Jasper County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  410/426
                  Are there other existing or changing conditions which, because of their impact on the public health, safety,
                  morality and general welfare of the community, give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the
                  proposed use?
                  (7)
                  The proposed use may be approved subject to such conditions as may be imposed in order to mitigate impacts
                  which may be expected without the imposition of conditions, and may be regulated in the same manner as
                  provided in section 119-445
