               This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Tattnall County, Georgia. 
               Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances as adopted by the Tattnall County Board of Commissioners through September 9, 2013. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
               The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
               Chapter and Section Numbering System 
               The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
               Page Numbering System 
               The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
               
                
               Indexes 
               The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
               Looseleaf Supplements 
               A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
               Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
               Acknowledgments

Failure to open the licensed establishment within the three-month period or the extended period shall serve as an automatic forfeiture and the cancellation of the license, and no refund of license fees shall be made. 
                  (b)  Any holder of a license hereunder who shall begin the operation of the businesses authorized in the license, but who shall for a period of three consecutive months thereafter cease to operate the business as authorized in the license, shall upon completion of said three-month period automatically forfeit his license, which license shall, by virtue of said failure to operate, be canceled without the necessity of any further action of the county. 
                  (Ord. of 9-13-1999, § 4-13) 
                  Sec. 6-91. - Suspension, revocation and probation of license.

Three days notice shall be deemed reasonable, but shorter or longer periods of notice shall be authorized as the circumstances may justify. 
                  (b)  The term "due cause" for suspension, revocation, or probation of such license shall consist of the violating of any local, state or federal laws, regulations or ordinances regulating such business or when the operation of the business has become undesirable, or for any reason which should authorize the refusal to issue or renew such license.

                  (1)  The chairman of the board of commissioners shall read or cause to be read the charges and specifications against the licensee. He shall then read or cause to be read any response filed by the licensee. 
                  (2)  The board of commissioners shall hear the evidence upon the charges and specifications as filed against the licensee and shall not consider any additional evidence beyond the scope of the charge, and may exclude evidence which is purely cumulative. 
                  (3)  The order of proof shall be as follows: The county representative shall present his evidence in support of the charges; the licensee shall then present his evidence. Evidence of each party may be supported by submission of pertinent documents. Each party shall be allowed to present pertinent rebuttal evidence. 
                  (4)  The licensee and county may be represented by counsel, and may present, examine and cross-examine witnesses. Additionally, the board of commissioners may interrogate all parties and witnesses to obtain necessary information. 
                  (5)  The chairman of the board of commissioners may suspend a business license or give three days notice that such license is subject to suspension when there is cause to believe that grounds exist for revoking the license. This action shall be reviewed at the next regular meeting of the board of commissioners; or, at the request of the license holder, a special meeting of the board of commissioners may be called within three days after such request is filed with the county to affirm or refuse the suspension after the hearing of the evidence. As accusation by a law enforcement officer shall be deemed due and sufficient cause for suspension. A license shall not be revoked except upon action by the board of commissioners.

                  (Ord. of 11-6-1978, intro.) 
                  Sec. 10-2. - Definitions. 
                  The definitions set forth in O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2 ("Alcoholic Beverages, Definitions"), shall be effective as definitions of the words, terms and phrases used in this chapter. All words, terms and phrases used herein, other than those specifically defined elsewhere in this chapter, shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2, and shall have the same scope and effect that the same words, terms and phrases have where used in O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2. 
                  Sec. 10-3. - Grant of licenses. 
                  (a)  Licenses shall be granted for a calendar year and shall expire on December 31 of the year for which issued regardless of the date issued and there shall be no rebate or proration of the annual license fee. 
                  (b)  The fee for the issuance of a license shall be in an amount as the county commissioners may from time to time fix. 
                  (c)  Licenses shall be granted only on written application. 
                  (d)  Applications for licenses shall be granted only by the county commissioners in session and no application shall be considered until notice of the application has been posted by the applicant at the courthouse door of the county for ten days nor until the sheriff of the county has reviewed the application and given a report to the county commissioners on the applicant and the proposed location. The applicant shall be responsible for posting the notice and shall attach to the application for which the license is sought the notice required by this chapter. Only the initial application for a new licensee and/or a new location shall be required to post the notice required by this chapter. Yearly renewals of the same licensee for the same location shall not require the posting of notices nor the investigation of the sheriff's office. The commissioners' office shall provide for the forms for the application required by this chapter. 
                  (e)  Each license shall be issued for a particular location and licensee and shall not be transferrable either as to location or the licenses.

Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a grocery store licensed for the retail sale of only wine and malt beverages for consumption off the premises from selling wine or malt beverages within 100 yards of any college campus, where so permitted by resolution or ordinance of the county or municipality. As used in this subsection, the term "grocery store" means a retail establishment which has at least 85 percent of its total retail floor space reserved for the sale of food and other nonalcoholic items, conducts all of its sales inside the building containing its retail floor space, and meets such other criteria as may be required by the local governing authority of the county or municipality. 
                  (g)  In any location when a majority of people living within one mile of the location shall oppose the grant of the license and shall file a petition with the county commissioners opposing the grant of the license, a license may be withheld where it reasonably appears that a majority of the people living within one mile of the location oppose the grant of the license and that issuance of the license would be a hazard or nuisance to the neighborhood. 
                  (h)  Any false statement in an application for a license shall be sufficient ground for revocation of the license. 
                  (i)  The county commissioners shall consider all circumstances which may reflect favorably or unfavorably upon the applicant, the application, and the proposed location. If in the judgment of the county commissioners the circumstances are such that granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the general public, the commissioners shall deny the application. 
                  (j)  Also in determining whether or not any license applied for hereunder shall be granted, the county commissioners shall give particular consideration to the location for which the license is sought including traffic conditions, the general character of the neighborhood and community and the effect which a beer and wine store would have on the adjacent and surrounding property values and on the community standards and practices. 
                  (k)  The license fee shall be tendered with the application. 
                  (l)  A licensee shall not have any vested rights in a license and a license shall not be renewable as a matter of right. Subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, applications must be made and passed upon annually if a licensee desires to continue operation from year to year. Each application shall be considered as a new application except insofar as the requirements of posting notices are concerned even though the applicant may have a license for the same location for the previous year. Any licensee or any licensee applicant who is dissatisfied with the revocation or refusal to grant him a license, may have a hearing before the county commissioners upon requesting the same in writing.

                  Sec. 10-4. - Qualification of licensee.

                  (2)  If the applicant is a partnership, each partner must be qualified to obtain the license as an individual and the application shall show this fact. 
                  (3)  If the applicant is a corporation, each officer and stockholder of the corporation must be qualified to obtain the license as an individual. 
                  (b)  Licenses may be granted and applications received from nonresident applicants or prospective licensees. The term "nonresident" means those persons who are not citizens, as defined by the code of the state, of the county. Nonresident applicants may be granted licenses upon the approval of the commissioners and upon the further condition that said licensees or applicants shall pay an additional $100.00 for the issuance and/or renewal of a license plus said licensees or applicants must be property owners of the county. The term "property owners" means that the individual or individuals must own real property located in whole or in part inside the boundary of the county.

                  (c)  No beer or wine shall be sold at retail on which the county beer or wine (as the case may be) tax is not paid. 
                  (d)  No wine or beer shall be sold or offered for sale in the county between the hours of 12:00 midnight on Saturday and 5:00 a.m. on the following Monday, nor between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. on the other days of the week. 
                  (e)  No beer or wine shall be possessed or sold or held for sale at retail except beer or wine purchased from a wholesaler licensed to make sales in the county.

                  (2)  Violation of any provision of this chapter or any other ordinance or any law relating to drugs or alcoholic beverages (liquor, beer, wine); 
                  (3)  Boisterous or disorderly conduct on the premises for which the license was granted; 
                  (4)  A finding by the commissioners that the operation of the licensee on the premises for which the license was granted constitutes a public nuisance.

Such demand shall be made on a form prescribed by rule or regulation of the department of revenue and shall notify the owner of his or her right to a judicial hearing to determine the validity of the lien. The demand shall further state that failure to return the written demand to the lien claimant, file with a court of competent jurisdiction a petition for a judicial hearing, and provide the lien claimant with a copy of such petition, all within ten days of delivery of the lien claimant's written demand, shall effect a waiver of the owner's right to such a hearing prior to sale.

The person asserting such lien may move to foreclose by making an affidavit to a court of competent jurisdiction, on a form prescribed by rule or regulation of the department of revenue, showing all facts necessary to constitute such lien and the amount claimed to be due. Such affidavit shall aver that the notice requirements of O.C.G.A. § 40-11-2 have been complied with, and such affidavit shall also aver that a demand for payment in accordance with subsection (2) of this section has been made without satisfaction or without a timely filing of a petition for a judicial hearing or that the identity of the owner cannot be ascertained. The person foreclosing shall verify the statement by oath or affirmation and shall affix his or her signature thereto; 
                  (4)  If no timely petition for a hearing has been filed with a court of competent jurisdiction, then, upon such affidavit's being filed by the lien claimant pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, the lien will conclusively be deemed a valid one and foreclosure thereof allowed; 
                  (5)  If a petition for a hearing is filed with a court of competent jurisdiction within ten days after delivery of the lien claimant's demand, a copy of which demand shall be attached to the petition, the court shall set such a hearing within ten days of filing of the petition; 
                  (6)  Upon the filing of such petition by an owner, neither the lien claimant nor the court may sell the motor vehicle, although possession of the motor vehicle may be retained by the lien claimant or obtained by the court in accordance with the order of the court which sets the date for the hearing; 
                  (7)  If, after a full hearing, the court finds that a valid debt exists, then the court shall authorize foreclosure upon and sale of the motor vehicle subject to the lien to satisfy the debt if such debt is not otherwise immediately paid; 
                  (8)  If the court finds the actions of the person asserting the lien in retaining possession of the motor vehicle were not taken in good faith, then the court, in its discretion, may award damages to the owner, any party which has been deprived of the rightful use of the vehicle, or the lessee due to the deprivation of the use of the motor vehicle; and 
                  (9)  If an affidavit meeting the requirements of subsection (3) of this section is filed and no petition for a hearing is timely filed, or if, after a full hearing, the court determines that a valid debt exists, the court shall issue an order authorizing the sale of such motor vehicle. However, the holder of a security interest in or a lien on the vehicle, other than the holder of a lien created by O.C.G.A. § 40-11-4, shall have the right, in the order of priority of such security interest or lien, to pay the debt and court costs. If the holder of a security interest or lien does so pay the debt and court costs, he or she shall have the right to possession of the vehicle, and his security interest in or lien on such vehicle shall be increased by the amount so paid.

                  (a)  Roads. The use of county roads by an operator transmitting timber or pulpwood must not endanger the traveling public; where damage does occur, the roads so damaged shall be restored to their previous condition, including, but not limited to, removal of debris and mud and replacement of gravel. Trucks or other equipment used in the harvesting operation shall not be allowed to park on the right-of-way for extended periods of time.

                  (c)  Termination. At the termination of harvesting activities at each site, the operator shall immediately notify the county commissioner's office, a representative of which shall make an inspection of the site on the county road system affected by the harvesting activities. The inspection shall take place within three working days of receipt of the notice. 
                  (d)  Results of inspection/appeal/release. If the board of commissioners or its designee determines that damage has occurred, the board of commissioners or its designee will make a detailed report, identifying the damage, to remedial action needed to be taken to repair the damage, and the estimated cost to repair the damage. The report shall be delivered to the applicant, and the applicant shall pay the county the cost of the damage within ten days of the receipt of the specifications describing the damage to the road. If the operator does not agree with the assessment of the damages, the operator may appeal the decision, within two days of the receipt of the county's assessment, to an arbitration board.

The board of arbitration shall set a date for a hearing within two days of their appointment, and the hearing will be had within seven days of the date of their appointment, at the county courthouse. If the board of arbitration finds the operator damaged the county road, the operator shall be required to pay the cost of the arbitration in addition to paying the county for damage to the road. If the board of arbitration finds there is either no damage to the road, or the damage to the road was not the result of the operator's use of the road, or the damage has been overstated by more than 30 percent, the county and the operator shall each pay half of the cost of the arbitration. If the operator fails to pay the county within ten days of the arbitrator's decision, the county may proceed to enforce the collection of the damages by the insurance of fi. fa. and by collection of the bond given for the faithful performance and compliance with this article.

                  Sec. 26-130. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  Created by federal homeland security presidential directive (HSPD) 5, the national incident management system (NIMS) establishes a single, comprehensive approach to domestic incident management to ensure that all levels of government across the nation have the capability to work efficiently and effectively together using a national approach to domestic incident management. 
                  (b)  NIMS provides a consistent nationwide approach for federal, state, and local governments to work together to prepare for and respond to, and recover from domestic incidents regardless of the cause, size, or complexity. 
                  (c)  NIMS also provides for interoperability and compatibility among federal, state, and local capabilities and includes a core set of concepts, principles, terminology, and technologies covering the incident command system, unified command, training, management of resources, and reporting. 
                  (d)  The state has enacted through law (O.C.G.A. § 38-3-57) that all local public safety and emergency response organizations, including emergency management agencies, law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and emergency medical services, shall implement the standardized unified incident command system and that those agencies that do not establish such system shall not be eligible for state reimbursement for any response or recovery related expenses. 
                  Sec. 26-131. - Enacted. 
                  The county hereby adopts the national incident management system (NIMS) as established under HSPD5 and the unified command system as established under O.C.G.A. § 38-3-57 as its system of preparing for and responding to disaster incidents and directs all incident managers and response organizations in the county to train and exercise and use these systems in their response operations.

               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 30-1. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, section II of the constitution of the state and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the board of commissioners of the county does ordain as follows. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010(1), art. 1, § A) 
                  Sec. 30-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010(1), art. 1, § B) 
                  Sec. 30-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010(1), art. 1, § C) 
                  Sec. 30-4. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Sec. 30-6. - Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
                  (a)  The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study (FIS), dated December 17, 2010, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this chapter. 
                  (b)  For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS dated December 17, 2010, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, for the county are hereby adopted by reference. 
                  (c)  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. 
                  (d)  The repository for public inspection of the flood insurance study (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting data is located at the office of the board of commissioners. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010(1), art. 2, § B) 
                  Sec. 30-7. - Establishment of development permit. 
                  A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010(1), art. 2, § C) 
                  Sec. 30-8. - Compliance. 
                  No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010(1), art. 2, § D) 
                  Sec. 30-9. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
                  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010(1), art. 2, § E) 
                  Sec. 30-10. - Interpretation. 
                  In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be: 
                  (1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
                  (2)  Liberally construed in favor of the board of county commissioners; and 
                  (3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010(1), art. 2, § F) 
                  Sec. 30-11. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
                  The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the county or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010(1), art. 2, § G) 
                  Sec. 30-12. - Penalties for violation. 
                  Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or with any of its requirements, including conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a violation. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than 90 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the county from taking such other lawful actions as are necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010(1), art. 2, § H) 
                  Sec. 30-13. - Definitions. 
                  Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
                  Accessory structure means a structure having minimal value and used for parking, storage and other non-habitable uses, such as garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, hay sheds and the like.

                  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and storage of materials or equipment. 
                  Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before May 1, 2005, the effective date of the initial FIRM for that community. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 3, 1998, the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
                  (2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the federal insurance administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A.

                  Flood insurance study means the official report by the federal insurance administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. The term "freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
                  (1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the term means the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after May 1, 2005, the effective date of the initial FIRM and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after August 3, 1998, the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after August 3, 1998, the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis;

                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note—Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note—The market value of the structure should be: 
                  (1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  (2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include: 
                  (1)  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  (2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  ARTICLE III. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 30-68. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010(1), art. 4, § A) 
                  Sec. 30-69. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. 
                  a.  Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 30-68(4), "elevated buildings." 
                  b.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 30-47(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. section 30-68(6)) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  Meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a—c of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-6 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 30-70. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  (a)  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-6, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 30-6, then the county engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of article IV of this chapter. Only if data is not available from these sources, then the following provisions in subsections (a)(2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note—Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 30-68(4), "elevated buildings." All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  (b)  The county engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Sec. 30-71. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-6, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated (zones AE), the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 30-69. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010(1), art. 4, § D) 
                  Sec. 30-72. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-6 may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 30-68(4), "elevated buildings." The county engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 30-46(b)(1)c and(b)(2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 30-73. - Standards for subdivisions. 
                  The following are standards for subdivisions: 
                  (1)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (2)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  (3)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
                  (4)  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.

                  Sec. 30-75. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The county planning and zoning board as established by the county board of commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the county engineer in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the county planning and zoning board may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the county planning and zoning board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The county engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the county planning and zoning board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR 261, and as amended. 
                  Lot means the contiguous land in the same ownership which is not divided by any public highway or alley, including any part thereof subject to any easement for any purpose other than a public highway or alley, but excluding any part thereof severed from another lot where the severance creates any nonconformity of size or use. 
                  Perennial river/stream means a river/stream or section of a river/stream that normally flows continuously throughout the whole year. 
                  Protected river corridor means all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of a protected river within a distance of 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river measured from the uppermost part of the river bank; the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the water is included in the protected area. 
                  River/stream bank means the rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  Subdivision means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose of sale, legacy, or building development, whether immediate or future. This shall include all divisions or re-subdivisions of land involving a new road or change in existing roads. Excluded from this definition is the combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased. 
                  Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government.

The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
                  (Ord. of 9-10-2001, § 3) 
                  Sec. 34-99. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Permit required. No building, mobile home, structure, or land within the jurisdiction of the county shall hereafter be erected, constructed, located, moved, used, subdivided, altered or disturbed except in conformity with the regulations herein and without first obtaining a permit from the county board of commissioners. This provision does and shall apply to the location of all manufactured housing and industrialized buildings in the county. 
                  (b)  Minimum lot size. All lots intended for residential or other use within the county shall be of such size as necessary to meet all requirements, rules, and regulations of the state department of human resources according to the "Rules of Georgia Department of Human Resources Public Health for On-Site Sewage Management Systems" manual for on-site sewage management; and as necessary to comply with the minimums set forth in the tables MT-1 and MT-2 hereby attached to and made a part of this article in section 34-107, if on-site sewage management is utilized; and/or this article, whichever is stricter. 
                  (c)  On-site sewage management permit required. No person or business shall construct an on-site sewage management system on any lot within the county until site approval and an on-site sewage management construction permit has been obtained from and issued by the county health department. 
                  (d)  Permit coordination. The required permit under subsection (a) of this section shall not be issued until the county health department issues an on-site sewage management construction permit or a site approval letter, whichever is appropriate, so that all lots proposed to be used or subdivided would satisfy the requirements of this article, including the "Rules of Georgia Department of Human Resources Public Health for On-Site Sewage Management Systems." If the county health department is delegated the responsibility for administering this article, the permit or letter under this subsection (d) shall suffice as the permit required under subsection (a) of this section. 
                  (e)  Requirements are minimum. The regulations and requirements set by this article shall be the minimum requirements. 
                  (f)  Compliance with state and federal regulations. All developments, structures, and uses within the county shall also meet the requirements of all other local, federal and state regulations in effect, including but not limited to, department of transportation regulations, state fire marshal regulations, the state's uniform construction codes, and the state department of natural resources and the state environmental protection division environmental rules and regulations. Issuance of a permit under this article does not constitute certification of compliance with such codes or regulations, and does not abrogate responsibility of the owner to so comply. 
                  (g)  Map interpretation. If there is any uncertainty as to whether a lot, portion of lot, or a proposed construction or location impacts an environmental resource regulated by this article because of interpretation of the applicable map, the decision of the county board of commissioners, or the county health department, if it is delegated the responsibility for administering this article, shall take precedent and be considered correct and final, but may be appealed as set forth in subsection (h) of this section. 
                  (h)  Map appeal. Any person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the county board of commissioners or the county health department, as appropriate, regarding map interpretation may at their own expense request reconsideration. Such reconsideration shall include submission of scientific evidence for reversal of the alleged error in map interpretation, and such evidence must be documented by a state registered engineer, geologist, or soils scientist. To obtain a reversal of the decision of map interpretation, the evidence must be acceptable to the state department of natural resources' environmental protection division, and the county board of commissioners, or/and the county health department if the county health department is delegated responsibility for administering this article. Any costs for submission of evidence to the state department of natural resources' environmental protection division shall be borne by the person requesting reconsideration. 
                  (i)  Coordination with zoning and other regulation. This article shall be coordinated with any zoning or other regulations adopted by the county board of commissioners, and if there is any conflict with those zoning or other regulations, the stricter provisions shall apply. If zoning is or has been adopted, the provisions of this article shall be considered an overlay, or additional requirement(s) to the requirements of underlying zoning regulations and district. 
                  (j)  Fees. Any fees for applications, inspections, and the issuance of permits or certificates required or issued under the provisions of this article shall be paid by the person seeking such permit at the time of application in advance of the issuance of such permits or certificates. The amount of such fees, if any, shall be those established by the county board of commissioners from time to time.

                  Sec. 34-100. - Delegation of article administration. 
                  The county board of commissioners, because of the need for coordination, hereby charges the county health department and the county manager with responsibility for administering this article and ensuring compliance with its provisions. 
                  (Ord. of 9-10-2001, § 5) 
                  Sec. 34-101. - Wetlands protection regulations. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. 
                  (b)  Reference map. The official maps to be used as the determinant for location of wetlands in the county and to be regulated areas under this article will be the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's national wetlands inventory maps for the county. These maps portray generalized wetlands inventory areas, and these wetlands inventory areas do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland delineation by that agency. 
                  (c)  Wetlands development permit requirements. No activity or use except those identified in subsection (d) of this section shall be allowed within wetlands without a permit under this article. Activities or uses permitted under section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act may receive a local permit once any required federal permit, or if appropriate, letter of permission/determination, is obtained as described below, and any other applicable provisions of this article have been satisfied: 
                  (1)  If there is a determination in the administration of this article that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein would not be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and would not disturb an identified wetlands inventory area, no further action concerning this particular article is necessary. 
                  (2)  If there is a determination in the administration of this article that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein may be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and might disturb wetlands which appear to be under the jurisdiction of section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination shall be required prior to issuance of a permit under this article. 
                  (3)  If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination is required, no local permit under this article will be issued until the person requesting the permit, at their own expense, obtains either a section 404 permit, if so required, or a letter of permission/determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that no federal permit is required. 
                  (4)  No action in the administration of this article, or no local permit issued pursuant to this article relieves the landowner from any federal or state permitting requirements, including those relating to wetlands or land disturbance. 
                  (d)  Permitted uses not requiring a permit. The following uses are permitted without permit within the wetlands of the county to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein: 
                  (1)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission (section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, section 404 does list some required road construction best management practices that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption). 
                  (2)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, or other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require a section 404 permit. 
                  (3)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  (4)  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  (5)  Normal agriculture activities including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the department of agriculture. 
                  (e)  Prohibited uses. In compliance with the state "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria," the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them: 
                  (1)  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
                  (2)  Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills. 
                  (Ord. of 9-10-2001, § 6) 
                  Sec. 34-102. - Groundwater recharge areas protection regulations. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste, like septic tank effluents, contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  (b)  Reference map. The official map for delineation of significant groundwater recharge areas in the county to be regulated areas under this article is the state department of natural resources' "Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 edition)."

                  Sec. 34-103. - Major river corridor protection district regulations. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. Perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second are of vital importance to the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. These river corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters. 
                  (b)  District delineation. Protected rivers as defined under the rules for environmental planning criteria, adopted by the state department of natural resources pursuant to section 12-2-8 of article 1, chapter 2, title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, includes any perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second. The Altamaha River and the Ohoopee River through Tattnall County meet this criteria. A protected river corridor and a protective 100-foot vegetation buffer is hereby established along the entire length of these rivers within the jurisdiction of the county. The buffer area is measured horizontally from each river bank within the county jurisdiction. Under the method prescribed by the rules for environmental planning criteria, no development or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the protected river corridor and within a 100-foot buffer of the river bank except for the following permitted uses. 
                  (c)  Permitted uses. No development, or construction, or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the 100-foot buffer from the protected river except for the following uses, and the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land-disturbing activity or construction permitted within the river corridor for these acceptable uses. 
                  (1)  Single-family dwellings, if any underlying zoning district so permits, provided each dwelling is located on a lot with a minimum size as specified by the county health department or the underlying zoning district regulations, but shall be the greater of these requirements; however, in any case the lot for each dwelling shall not be less than two acres, not including any area between the river banks; and provided the septic tank drainfield is located outside of the 100-foot buffer area. 
                  (2)  Any residential uses existing or under construction prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances, provided the use has an on-site sewage management construction permit issued by the county health department prior to the date of adoption of these local protection ordinances. 
                  (3)  Any industrial or commercial uses existing prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances, providing they do not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended, and meet all other federal and state environmental regulations. 
                  (4)  Road and utility crossings, providing the construction of these crossings meets the requirements of the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended, or any local requirements, if stricter. 
                  (5)  Timber production and harvesting, providing it is consistent with the best management practices established by the state forestry commission, and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (6)  Agricultural production and management, provided it is consistent with the best management practices established by the state soil and water conservation commission, and all other state and federal laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the state department of agriculture and the state environmental protection division; and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (7)  Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of section 12-2-8 (as amended) of article 1, chapter 2, title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  (8)  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  (9)  Wastewater treatment. 
                  (10)  Recreational usage consistent with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river dependent recreation. 
                  (d)  Prohibited uses. In compliance with the state "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria," the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them. 
                  (1)  Facilities or areas used for the handling, receiving, storing, or disposal of hazardous wastes. 
                  (2)  Hazardous or solid waste landfills. 
                  (3)  Septic tank drainfields within the 100-foot buffer area under any circumstance. 
                  (4)  Septic tanks within the 100-foot buffer area, except as expressly provided for single-family dwellings which are permitted under and comply with subsection (c)(1) of this section.

                  Sec. 34-104. - Variances. 
                  When due to a particular hardship or extraordinary circumstance of the property involved which is not easily corrected, it is impractical for an owner or developer to comply with all of the requirements of this article, the county board of commissioners shall be authorized to vary such requirements (under its jurisdiction) only to such extent as to provide fairness to the owner or developer and as to not violate the intent and purposes of this article. Such variances shall only be granted in an official public meeting, and the reasons for granting them shall be entered into the minutes of the public meeting. 
                  (Ord. of 9-10-2001, § 9)

The decision by the county commissioners as to the name assigned to such road shall be final.
