PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Dawsonville, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were ordinances adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Ellen K. Torof, Senior Legal Tech/Editor of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to the city attorney's officer and city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  Sec. 2-133. - Inventory of items. 
                  (a)  Inventory required; form; purpose. The coordinator shall be required to take an inventory of all city records. The inventory shall be taken on forms that are consistent with the form attached hereto as exhibit B. The purpose of this form shall be as follows: to collect the information necessary to compare a series with the common schedules; to establish basic management control over the series; and to serve as the official copy of the series schedule once approved by the city council and signed by the mayor. 
                  (b)  Completion of form required. The coordinator shall be required to complete one form for each record series, active and inactive, in the office and in record storage areas. In relation to completing the inventory schedule form, the coordinator shall be required to complete such forms and enter all information in accordance with the terms and directions as outlined below: 
                  (1)  Identity of records series custodian. The coordinator shall be required to identify the city as well as himself as being responsible for the record series. The block in the upper right corner of exhibit B shall be utilized to record the assigned series number and the number of the applicable common schedule. Further, the coordinator shall be required to develop a series number assignment log in an effort to track the record series status. The common schedule number shall not be entered until the city council approves its adoption. 
                  (2)  Series description. The information entered in this section of exhibit B shall describe the records series, it content, and its use. 
                  a.  Title of record series. Enter the official series title. The title should reflect the activity documented by the file. If the series is known by an informal title, such information shall be entered in parentheses. 
                  b.  Inclusive dates. Enter the month and year of the earliest and latest records in the series, those stored both in the office and in storage areas. If series is a current file, enter "to present" as latest date. 
                  c.  Physical form. Enter media of records in series; loose or bound paper, legal, letter, or other size; photographs; audio tapes; computer tapes, disks, etc. 
                  d.  Volume. Enter total accumulation of series in the office and in storage areas. Volume may be stated in the number of file drawers (legal, letter, card, etc.), the number of linear feet of shelf space occupied, or the number and size of storage boxes or containers filled, or, if desired, converted to cubic feet. Cubic feet shall be utilized as the standard records management measure for volume for the purposes of this article. A records center carton, measuring 10 inches × 12 inches × 15 inches, which will hold either letter or legal files, shall be used as a standard cubic-foot equivalent. A conversion table for cubic feet is attached hereto as exhibit C. 
                  e.  Annual rate of accumulation. If the series is a current file, the coordinator shall enter the growth in volume during the past year. 
                  f.  Reference rate. How frequently are last year's records consulted? 

                   
                  g.  Location. The coordinator shall enter filing section, room, building, or other information to pinpoint location of the records. If the series is divided and stored in more than one place, the coordinator shall list all locations. 
                  h.  Summary of series information content and use. The summary shall briefly answer the following questions, if applicable: 
                  1.  What activity or function creates/created these records? 
                  2.  What purpose were these records to serve? 
                  3.  What information is contained in the records? 
                  4.  Are completed forms included? If yes, attach a sample of each. 
                  5.  How is series arranged—alphabetically, numerically, chronologically, geographically, other? Specify and explain filing scheme. 
                  6.  Is series indexed? If yes, is index a separate series or part of another series? If so, give title and location. 
                  7.  Does this series serve as an index to another series? If yes, give title and location of that series. 
                  8.  Are copies of all or part of this series filed in another series? If yes, give title and location of that series and explain the extent of duplication. 
                  9.  Is this entire series duplicated on microfilm? If yes, give location of the microfilm. 
                  i.  Does series contain confidential information? If yes, cite state or federal code or regulation that requires confidentiality of information. 
                  j.  Are records in series vital. Check yes if common schedule or local needs declare the records in the series to be vital. 
                  (c)  Comparison of descriptions and schedules. Once this portion of the form is completed for all records of the office, the coordinator shall be required to compare the inventory descriptions with the common schedules. The applicability of common schedules to inventoried records shall be determined by the similarity of the records series described to the common schedule description. If both the information content and the purpose for the creation of a series are the same, then the retention period of the common schedule shall be applicable for the inventoried series. The following shall be considered by the coordinator in any comparison: 
                  (1)  Series and a common schedule. 
                  a.  A series and a common schedule may have the same title but not contain the same information or serve the same purpose. The common schedule shall not be applicable. 
                  b.  A series and a common schedule may have different physical record forms, and filing arrangements may have the same information content and serve the same purpose. The common schedule shall be applicable. 
                  (2)  Several series, if combined, may be the same as one common schedule. The common schedule shall be applicable for all the series. 
                  (3)  Two or more common schedules, if combined, may be the same as one series. The longer retention period of the several common schedules shall be applicable. Records can be separated by retention period. 
                  (4)  Local administrative need or other city ordinances may require a retention period longer than that of the common schedule. The longer retention period should be recommended. 
                  (d)  Council approval of retention period and other requirements. Once a common schedule shall be determined applicable, the retention period of the common schedule plus any additional city ordinance retention requirements must be approved by the city council before same can be used.

                  (a)  Part 3 of the inventory/schedule form, exhibit B, shall be for recommending council approval of a common-schedule-based retention period. Once approved by the city council and executed by the mayor, the completed form shall become the official schedule for the series. 
                  (b)  The applicable common schedule number and the prescribed retention period shall be entered on the exhibit B in item #11. Longer retention periods required by the city's needs shall also be listed in item #11. If no current schedule is found applicable, item #12 shall be checked. 
                  (c)  The records coordinator shall thereafter execute the form recommending adoption of the common schedule period plus any extension of the period required by city's needs. The coordinator shall then submit the recommendation to the city council and mayor at the next regularly scheduled or specially called city council meeting. If approved by the city council, the mayor shall execute the form certifying approval. The signed form shall then become the official schedule for the series.

                  Sec. 2-135. - Compiling a central inventory of records property. 
                  (a)  The coordinator shall file all series inventory description forms in a central file to establish the official inventory of all records property. This file shall be arranged by local series number or by local schedule number. A log of assigned numbers shall be used to track the series scheduling status of other actions or decisions affecting the series. 
                  (b)  The coordinator shall develop a system to report and record the significant changes in status, creation, filing, or location of the series to the central inventory file. 
                  (c)  Program administrators and managers shall maintain a copy of the inventory forms for series in their custody. Both the central inventory and the office and program inventories shall be updated to reflect the disposal of records of a series. 
                  (d)  The coordinator shall maintain a file of disposal authorizations and actions. 
                  (Ord. of 5-5-1998, § 6) 
                  Sec. 2-136. - Retention schedule. 
                  The schedule to be followed by the coordinator, except as otherwise provided herein, in retaining records shall be in accordance with those terms and time periods in exhibit D to the ordinance from which this section is derived (on file in the city clerk's office). 
                  (Ord. of 5-5-1998, § 7) 
                  Sec. 2-137. - Lawful disposal of records. 
                  (a)  Disposal with authority and protection of law. Upon completing and fulfilling the terms contained herein, records older than their approved retention time period shall be disposed of with the authority and protection of law. Specifically, records assigned for disposal shall be checked against the approved local schedule and the authorizing common schedule descriptions. The records shall have the same information content and purpose as the records described in the approved common schedule. Records of mixed series or mixed dates within a series shall all have met their minimum retention requirements. 
                  (b)  Documents taking precedence over retention schedule. The following documents shall take precedence over the approved retention schedule period: 
                  (1)  Records of an activity under legal investigation shall not be disposed of until the investigation is completed. 
                  (2)  Records involved in litigation shall not be disposed of until the litigation is settled. 
                  (3)  Records involved in a fiscal or program audit shall not be disposed of until the audit is final. 
                  (4)  All record series that survive a fire or other disaster shall be subjected as a unit to careful scrutiny. A series with an expired retention period may contain the only information and evidence about the government's decisions and actions for a specific program area. 
                  (5)  Records created before 1950 shall not be disposed of until a careful review determines that essential information and evidence survives in other records being maintained and protected. 
                  (6)  Records created prior to 1900 must be appraised by the department of archives and history before disposal authorization. 
                  (c)  Council approval; appointment of individual to destroy; prevention of reconstruction. Once it is determined that the records from a series may be destroyed, the coordinator shall present same to the city council for their approval of disposal at a regularly or specially scheduled city council meeting. The request for destruction shall identify the record series, the volume, and the dates of the records to be disposed of. Upon receiving approval to destroy the documents, the city council shall appoint or designate an individual to destroy the approved records, and this individual shall be required to execute the authorization certifying that the records received were appropriately destroyed. Records containing confidential information shall be disposed of in a manner that prevents reconstruction of the information, such as shredding, burning or other physical destruction. 
                  (d)  Inventories to be updated. Finally, the inventories of the coordinator shall be updated to show the removal of the records from inventory. The coordinator shall maintain a file of the signed authorizations to document the lawful and appropriate disposal of the public property that the records constitute.

Such a withdrawal shall not serve to bring any new ownership into the partnership. This section shall not prohibit transfer of stock between persons who held stock in the corporation at the time of issuance of the license nor shall it prohibit transfers of stock, which does not result in any person increasing his stock holdings to a total of ten percent or more of any class of stock. 
                  (f)  Any licensee who desires to transfer the location of an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages within the city shall notify the city manager or designee prior to any transfer of location.

The city manager or designee may designate the city's auditor or other designated person to perform any audit authorized in this chapter. The licensee shall cooperate with the audit or forfeit any license issued under this chapter. Failure to arrange an agreed upon date within two months of an audit request will be deemed as an uncooperative act and the licensee will forfeit any licenses issued. 
                  (b)  All licensed establishments must maintain the following records for a three-year period and make them available for audit at the licensed premises: 
                  (1)  Monthly income or operating statements.

                  (4)  Monthly state sales and use tax reports. 
                  (5)  Federal income tax return with all form 1099-S. The city manager or designee can waive all or some of the requirements of this requirement if the city manager or designee finds that no such records exist and it is not financially practical based on the net income of the licensed establishment to require them to keep such records. 
                  (c)  If a licensed establishment is unable to provide the records, or does not meet the required food consumption percentage, another audit shall be performed within 90 days. If after two, or more, consecutive audits a licensed establishment is unable to provide the records, or does not meet the required food consumption percentage, the licensed establishment's license will be suspended for 30 days. During the 30-day suspension period, no alcoholic beverages will be allowed on the premise. 
                  (d)  If a licensed establishment has not paid the proper amount of excise tax for alcohol sales, then the licensed establishment's license shall be suspended for at least 30 days and shall not be reinstated until all excise taxes are paid in full based upon the audited amount of alcohol sales. If the proper amount of excise tax is not paid in full during the 30-day suspension, the alcohol license shall be revoked. 
                  (e)  Suspension or revocation of an alcohol license under this audit section shall be subject to the appeal rights set forth in section 3-50 et seq. When a license is suspended or revoked, the city shall not be required to refund any portion of the license fee or excise tax to the holder of such suspended or revoked license.

                  (5)  The city finds that its Town Center District is contemplated as the central commercial and entertainment center of the city where ample parking, infrastructure, an amphitheater, nearby residential uses, etc. are present to allow the sale and open container consumption of alcohol at city permitted events that may not be appropriate in other areas in the city. The city believes that this regulation will further the vitality of this area and attract additional businesses where the location in other areas may be harmful or detrimental. The city further finds that this advances a legitimate end of government and such regulations are reasonably related to these goals.

Provided, however, the requirement for minimum distance from a church or school building shall not apply to a new license for the retail sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Nothing in this subparagraph shall prohibit a grocery store licensed for the retail sale of only wine and malt beverages for consumption off the premises from selling wine or malt beverages within 100 yards of any school building, school grounds, or college campus. As used in this subparagraph, the term "grocery store" means a retail establishment which has a total retail floor space of at least 10,000 square feet of which at least 85 percent is reserved for the sale of food and other nonalcoholic items, conducts all of its sales inside the building containing its retail floor space, and meets such other criteria as may be required by the local governing authority of the county or municipality;

                  (d)  The term "school building" referred to in this section shall apply only to state, county, city or church school buildings. It includes only those structures in which instruction is offered. The term "instruction" refers to subjects commonly taught in the schools and colleges of this state.

                  (a)  Alcoholic beverage sales can be made by a licensed, consumption on premises, establishment in a patio/open area type environment if the establishment has been approved to do so by the city manager or designee. 
                  (b)  The requirement for approval of a patio/open area type environment is that the patio/open area be enclosed by some structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink without the licensee's knowledge. 
                  (c)  The height of the structure required in subsection (b) of this section shall be a minimum of 3½ feet above ground level. It does not have to be solid nor does it have to restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area. It must be permitted and approved by the city's building inspection department and the county's fire department as required by their governing regulations or codes. 
                  (d)  The only exit from this type area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises or through an approved fire exit (not for general public use unless an emergency exists). The fire exit should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists. 
                  (e)  If a licensee desires a patio/open sales area inside an existing structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the city manager or designee. Interior type patio/open sales areas must also meet the requirements of the city's building, development and fire codes. 
                  (f)  Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit a hotel or motel with a consumption on the premises license from making sales and allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages in ballrooms, meeting rooms, reception rooms, or patio areas of such hotel or motel provided such functions are catered in connection with a meeting, conference, convention or similar type gathering at such hotel or motel. "Patio areas," as that term is used in this subsection, do not have to conform to the standards in this section. 
                  (g)  Approved sidewalk cafes within the Town Center District, may be exempt from subsections (b) through (e) of this section upon approval be the city council.

                  (a)  Other than specifically provided for in this section or section 3-121, it is prohibited for customers to leave alcoholic beverage establishment premises, with open alcoholic beverages and it is the licensee's responsibility to ensure that no open alcoholic beverages are carried out. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the carrying out of wine or malt beverages for consumption at a golf course. Licensed entities during a city permitted event located in the Town Center District may sell individual alcoholic beverages for consumption to persons authorized to possess or consume alcoholic beverages in the Town Center District. 
                  (b)  It is prohibited for customers to gather outside an alcoholic beverage establishment and consume alcoholic beverages unless such consumption takes place within the Town Center District during hours and under the rules established herein. 
                  (c)  It is prohibited for the manager or any employee of an alcoholic beverage establishment to allow persons to gather outside an alcoholic beverage establishment and consume alcoholic beverages unless such consumption takes place within the Town Center District during hours and under the rules established herein.

                  It shall be unlawful for any establishment licensed under this chapter to make or cause to be made any loud, unnecessary or unusual sound or noise that unreasonably annoys, disturbs, inures or endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace, or safety of others in the city and that is audible to a person of normal hearing ability from the nearest property line of the business in question.

                  (a)  Owners, managers, and employees of a licensed business shall be responsible for keeping an orderly place and shall not permit any employee, patron, or other person to cause a disturbance or engage in loud, boisterous, lewd, or obscene conduct or practice within the establishment. 
                  (b)  The owner and manager of any alcoholic beverage establishment shall be responsible for monitoring parking lots and other outside areas around the establishment and prohibiting patrons and other persons associated with the establishment from standing, sitting, mingling, or assembling outside the licensed premises in a manner which causes or contributes to disturbances and/or illegal acts.

                  Sec. 3-127. - Adult entertainment. 
                  (a)  Preamble and purpose . Based upon the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences the city council believes are relevant to the problems faced by this city, the city council takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
                  Moreover, it is the finding of the city council that public nudity and semi-nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "erotic entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or semi-nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare, and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or semi-nudity. 
                  (b)  Prohibited activities . Any establishment licensed under the provisions of this chapter is prohibited from permitting or engaging in the following activities: 
                  (1)  The employment or use of any person in any capacity in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals. 
                  (2)  Live entertainment that provides or features nude or semi-nude or erotic dancing or the performance of obscene acts that simulate: 
                  a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts that are prohibited by law; 
                  b.  The touching, caressing or fondling of the breast, buttock, anus or genitals; or 
                  c.  The displaying of the pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals. 
                  (3)  The showing of any film, still pictures, electronic reproduction or other visual reproductions depicting any of the acts described in subsection (2), above or which are obscene under state law. 
                  (4)  The holding, promotion or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the above-prohibited conduct. 
                  (5)  Knowingly permitting of any person in the licensed premises to view from the licensed premises, by glass partition or other artifice, any of the above-prohibited conduct performed on premises other than the licensed premises. 
                  (6)  Knowingly permitting any person to remove any alcoholic beverage sold or dispensed on the licensed premises to adjacent or other premises for the purpose of view any of the above-prohibited conduct; provided, however, that this code section shall not be applicable to a person who removes an alcoholic beverage to his home or place of abode. 
                  (7)  The employment, encouragement, allowance or assistance of any person to engage in the above-prohibited conduct. 
                  (c)  Mainstream activity excluded . Notwithstanding the prohibitions in subsection (b), nothing in this chapter shall be or is intended to apply to theatrical or motion picture performance houses, museums, or to restaurants or places set apart for traditional family-oriented naturism where the consumption or service of alcohol is not a primary purpose or the mainstream activity of such establishment. The phrase "places provided or set apart for nudity" means as follows: places provided or set apart for traditional family oriented naturism including nudist parks, clubs, and resorts chartered by the American Association for Nude Recreation or affiliated with the Naturist Society or by traditional family-oriented naturist groups.

                  Sec. 8-78. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse effect on property values, on the public health, safety, and welfare of the city, on its citizens and property and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protective form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhood through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
                  (b)  In addition thereto, it is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials or entertainment including sexually oriented materials or entertainment. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials or entertainment protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.

                  (5)  All applicants shall furnish all data, information and records requested of them, and failure to furnish such data, information and records within 30 days from the date of such request shall automatically serve as grounds to deny the application. An applicant, by filing an application, agrees to produce for questioning any person or persons who are considered relevant to the ascertainment of facts relative to such permit, as may be required by, the county sheriff's office. The failure to produce such person within 30 days after being requested to do so may result in denial of the application. 
                  (6)  All permits issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the county sheriff's office. 
                  (7)  All permits issued hereunder remain the property of the county sheriff's office and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer of the county sheriff's office, the planning director or city code enforcement officer. 
                  (8)  No pawnshop owner shall allow any employee or manager to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid city permit. Upon the filing of the notice with the county sheriff's office, the applicant may become a conditional employee and work on the licensed premises with a receipt issued by the county sheriff's office until such time the investigation is completed, and approval or denial of the permit is issued. 
                  (9)  For the purpose of this section, independent contractors shall be considered as employees and shall be permitted as employees, regardless of the business relationship with the owner or managing agent of any pawnshop. 
                  (10)  Employee permits are nontransferable and are valid only for the individual named on the permit. Each such permit is valid for the individual named while employed in any establishment licensed in the city. 
                  (11)  Permits issued under this section shall be active for a period of one year. At the expiration of one year from the date of the issuance of the permit, it shall be the duty of the employee to renew the permit by going through the process described in this section. In addition, employees who cease employment with a pawn shop establishment with which they were employed when their permit was obtained for a period of six months or more must also renew their permit before returning to a pawn shop establishment in the city. 
                  (12)  Employees after receiving their permit must notify the county sheriff's office of any changes in information originally provided to obtain an employee permit; otherwise, their permit is invalid. Employees who [commit] an offense that may affect their employment under this article are under a duty to fully inform the county sheriff's office of such conviction, and to supply sufficient documentation relating to the conviction to allow the city to fully investigate. Failure to inform the county sheriff's office and/or provide documentation of any such conviction invalidates a permit and shall serve as automatic forfeiture and cancellation of the permit. 
                  (13)  It shall also be the duty of the pawn broker to file with the planning and zoning office and the county sheriff's office, on a monthly basis, a report which lists all employees currently employed in a capacity that would require an employee permit. Each such report shall include the name and date of birth of all such individuals, as well as the same information on all such individuals who have terminated employment during the one-month employment period. Failure to submit said report by the twentieth day each month shall constitute a violation of this Code. 
                  (14)  Any applicant who is denied a permit may appeal such denial by filing a notice of appeal pursuant to the appeal procedure set forth in section 2-16.

                  Sec. 8-507. - Commencement for business—Forfeiture of license. 
                  (a)  All holders of licenses under this article shall, within six months after the issuance of the license, open for business the establishment referred to in the license, unless such period is extended by the mayor and council. Failure to open the licensed establishment as referred to in this subsection within the six-month period shall serve as an automatic forfeiture and cancellation of the license, and no refund of license fees shall be made to the license holder. 
                  (b)  Any holder of a license under this article who shall begin the operation of the business as authorized in the license, but who shall for a period of three consecutive months thereafter cease to operate the business as authorized in the license, shall automatically forfeit his license, which license shall, by virtue of such failure to operate, be canceled without the necessity for any further action by the planning director, city code enforcement officer or the mayor and council.

                  Sec. 8-508. - License transfer. 
                  No license granted for a pawnshop shall be transferable except upon application to planning and zoning department in the same form and manner, and subject to the same requirements with respect to the transferee as are applicable in an original application. Any such license may be transferred only to another applicant doing the same business at the same location as the license holder to whom the license was originally issued provided and excepting, however, that if the license holder is a partnership and one or more of the partners should die, one or more of the surviving partners may acquire, by purchase or otherwise, the interest of the deceased partner or partners without affecting a surrender or termination of such license, and in such case, the license upon notification to the city shall be placed in the name of the surviving partner. When permission for transfer has been granted, the original licensee or transferee shall cease doing business and deliver the license to the planning director, who shall record such transfer, and the transferee shall pay a fee therefore as a condition precedent to engaging in operations under the license. The fee for such transfer shall be established from time to time by the mayor and council.

                  Sec. 8-509. - Record of transactions. 
                  (a)  Every pawnbroker shall maintain a permanent electronic record of its pawn transactions in which an accurate description of all property pledged, traded or sold to the pawnshop can be transmitted to the county sheriff's office via an electronic automated reporting system. Each of these transactions shall contain an accurate description of all property pledged, traded or sold to the pawnbroker and shall be made at the time of each transaction, provided that the following information is included: 
                  (1)  The date and time of the purchase, pawn or sale of the property. 
                  (2)  The full name, street address and telephone number of the customer making the pledge, trade or sale. 
                  (3)  The pawnshop shall require all persons pledging, trading, pawning, exchanging, or selling property to show accepted identification as defined in section 2-2 prior to conducting a pawnshop transaction. 
                  (4)  A description of the customer in terms of sex, race, date of birth, height and weight, as well as the driver's license number of the customer or some other identification card which contains a photograph of the customer. 
                  (5)  A description of the pledged or purchased property by serial, model or other number, if available, and by any identifying marks (e.g., brand name, color, style, etc.). 
                  (6)  The number of the receipt or pawn transaction issued for the property pawned or bought. 
                  (7)  The price paid, or the amount loaned. 
                  (8)  The maturity date of the transaction, if a pawn. 
                  (9)  A photograph of the customer and the item pawned or bought which will be taken with the electronic automated reporting system at the time of the transaction. 
                  (10)  The pawnshop shall obtain from each person pledging, trading, pawning, exchanging, or selling any property, the fingerprint of the right-hand index finger, unless such finger is missing, in which event the print of the next finger in existence on the right hand shall be obtained with a notation as to the exact finger printed. An electronic digital fingerprint scanner will be the primary method of entry required. The fingerprint shall be imprinted onto the pawn transaction form in the designated area along with the signature of the person pawning, trading, pledging, exchanging, or selling the property. The fingerprint must be clear and legible. In the event that more than one pawn transaction form is required, a fingerprint and signature should be obtained for each form. Fingerprints and the information required herein shall be obtained each time such person pledges, trades, pawns, exchanges, or sells any property. 
                  (11)  The signature of the customer. 
                  (12)  The tag bearing the pawnshop transaction number must remain attached to the item until the property is disposed of by sale, trade, or other lawful means. This paragraph does not apply to the purchase of property from licensed wholesale or distributor businesses for the purpose of retail sales; however, the pawnshop shall be required to maintain all purchasing records for property exempted from this paragraph. 
                  (b)  Every pawnbroker shall enter each transaction as it occurs into the electronic automated reporting system or may elect to upload electronically via the internet a batch file of all transactions for each business day to the administrator of the electronic automated reporting system immediately at the conclusion of each business day. The administrator of the electronic automated reporting system will electronically transmit all transactions to the county sheriff's office. 
                  (c)  The pawnshop shall store the above records, digital images, and fingerprints for a period as designated by state statute and make them available to law enforcement personnel upon request. 
                  (d)  In the event that the electronic automated reporting system becomes temporarily or permanently disabled, or the system is terminated pawnbrokers will be notified as soon as possible, by the administrator of the system. Pawnshops that incur electronic system failures or other events that would cause partial or complete loss of electronic reporting, should immediately notify the county sheriff's office with the reason of the failure. In these events, the pawnbrokers will be required to make records of transactions in paper form. Such paper forms must include all information as enumerated in paragraph (a) of this section. Pawnbrokers shall maintain a three-day supply of these paper forms. On a daily basis, all transactions not reported in the electronic automated reporting system, will be delivered to the county sheriff's office by the pawnshop within 24 hours of the end of the business day for every day until the event has been corrected. 
                  (e)  Any duly authorized law enforcement officer authorized by the county sheriff, may, during the ordinary hours of business or any other reasonable time, inspect any pawnbroker's electronic or paper records or any goods in his possession at the pawnbroker's place of business to ensure compliance not only with this section, but this article and state law. 
                  (f)  The sheriff or his designee shall select and designate the required automated reporting system and required equipment needed. A fee will be assessed to each pawnshop for each reported transaction: said fee shall be an amount set by the sheriff equal to that charged by the administrator of the automated reporting system. 
                  The assessed fee to the pawnshops shall not exceed the actual cost charged by the city or by the third-party administrator. This fee will be invoiced to the pawnbroker and collected by the sheriff or his designee, which may be a third-party administrator of the automated reporting system.

                  Sec. 8-510. - Disposal of articles. 
                  Any pawnbroker or employee of a pawnshop who makes a loan on pledged goods or buys pledged goods on the condition that the seller may repurchase said goods, shall hold said goods for at least 30 days or longer if directed by the county sheriff's office, before disposing of them by sale, transfer, shipment or otherwise. Non-pledged goods bought under this section shall be held for at least seven calendar days before disposing of them by sale, transfer, shipment or otherwise.

                  (2)  No employee of the city with regulating authority may own, work in or be employed (paid or unpaid) by a pawnshop inside the city limits of the city. Regulating authority, for purposes of this section, is defined as any person involved in or assigned to the inspection of the premises, approval of the occupation tax certificate applications, annual pawnshop license applications, or annual employee permit applications; and granting or denying of such applications, or enforcement of this article and its provisions. 
                  (3)  No employee of the city with regulating authority as defined herein, may regulate a pawnshop where such is owned or operated by any person related to the employee of the city within a third degree of kinship.

The pawnbroker must maintain all records, invoices, and bills of sale for such merchandise which shall be subject to inspection and review by any duly authorized law enforcement. No article(s) shall be maintained on the premises for sale on a consignment basis for any citizen, employee or pawnbroker.

                  (b)  With respect to any item(s) which would normally have a serial number or other means of identification, any pawnbroker or employee of a pawnbroker who becomes aware that such items have had the identification removed, defaced or destroyed, such fact shall be immediately reported to the county sheriff's office. 
                  (c)  If it is determined that an item bought, sold, traded or pawned by a seller or customer to the pawnbroker or his employee is the subject of any reported theft, then the surrender of said item to the county sheriff's office shall be done upon demand. The officer receiving the item shall give the pawnbroker a receipt for the item. 
                  (d)  The county sheriff's office has the authority to place property that is the subject of investigation on "investigative hold."

                  (3)  Except as provided in the transfers, section 2-9, transfers, any change in the ownership of any entity owning a licensed location shall be grounds for the mayor and council to revoke any license issued under this article.

                  (Ord. of 6-6-1989, § 8; Ord. of 6-1-2009 § 4) 
                  Sec. 10-22. - Duties of the city. 
                  The city shall have, among others, the following duties: 
                  (1)  To prepare and provide the necessary forms for the application for a permit and for the submission of any required information as may be necessary to properly administer and enforce the provisions of this article. 
                  (2)  To review the application for completeness and collect whatever application fee may be required; to designate or coordinate sites and set time schedules; to coordinate with the appropriate authorities on all matters concerning such activities; and, where appropriate, to receive input from the department of transportation, state highway patrol, police chief, and the sheriff, or any other necessary public officer, for the requested activity. 
                  (3)  To forward application material to appropriate public safety entities or individuals for their collective input as to the impact the proposed parade, demonstration, rally, road closing, or other such activity shall have, if any, on the public's health, safety, and welfare. This assessment should include, but not be limited to the impact of the requested activity on the free flow of vehicular traffic, the free flow of pedestrian traffic, and the free movement of emergency vehicles. 
                  (4)  To consider, process, and decide whether to issue permits upon applications submitted pursuant to this ordinance within ten days or less of the acceptance by the city, of a completed application. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-1989, § 4; Ord. of 6-1-2009 § 5) 
                  Sec. 10-23. - Application process. 
                  (a)  Every applicant for a permit under the provisions of this article shall submit an application for the permit to the city, which application shall conform to the requirements of this section in addition to any other provisions of this article. 
                  (b)  Unless otherwise provided herein, each application shall be a written statement upon forms provided by the city and submitted within a reasonable time prior to the event, at least ten days prior to the planned activity for security checks, verifications, and arrangements to be made, as well as for input to be received from affected local and state entities. 
                  (1)  While ten days is expressed as a minimum requirement for submission of an application under this article, the city reserves its right to implement content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions on first amendment activities, or to deny an application if insufficient time is available for the city to properly plan or prepare for the event requested in the application, if such inability creates one or more of the situations or conditions described in section 10-24(b)(4) below. 
                  (2)  While ten days is expressed as a minimum requirement for submission of an application under this article, all applicants for whom it is possible to submit an application under this article prior to an event shall do so, even if the application will be submitted within ten days of the event at issue. In such circumstances, the city will endeavor with all deliberate speed to process and make a decision on the application prior to the date of the event at issue. Nothing contained herein waives the city's authority to implement content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions on first amendment activities, or to deny an application if insufficient time is available for the city to properly plan or prepare for the event requested in the application, if such inability creates one or more of the situations or conditions described in section 10-24(b)(4) below. 
                  (3)  While ten days is expressed as a minimum requirement for submission of an application under this article, the city has no intention of suppressing spontaneous free speech activities which, because of their nature and/or need for immediate action, cannot conform to the application process. The foregoing notwithstanding, any spontaneous free speech activities must be preceded by at least 24 hours advance notice to the Dawson County Sheriff's Office. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to limit, restrict, inhibit, reduce, or otherwise impact the right of the city or its authorities to enforce other local laws and/or the laws of the State of Georgia if such spontaneous speech activities violate said laws. 
                  (d)  The city shall respond with a decision on the application within ten days or less, if possible, of the receipt of the completed application, such time being necessary to process the application and obtain needed input from affected local and state agencies as hereinafter described. 
                  (e)  Each application shall contain the following information: 
                  (1)  Applicant information: the following information shall be collected only for the purpose of processing the application, and shall not otherwise be released unless required by law. 
                  a.  Name and home address of the applicant, or home office address if a corporation or partnership, and telephone where the applicant may be contacted; 
                  b.  Names and home addresses of the partners, if a partnership; 
                  c.  Names and home addresses of the officers and directors, if a corporation; 
                  d.  Identification of all prior parade, public assembly and demonstration permits applied for by the applicant for a parade, pubic assembly or demonstration within the city. 
                  (2)  Event information. 
                  a.  Date, time, and place where the proposed activity is to be carried on, including proposed routes of passage of parades or other proceedings;

                  c.  Information on the number of expected participants, the length of the requested activity, a physical description of the materials to be distributed, if any, and how, if at all, participants intend to interact with the general public; 
                  d.  A certification from the applicant acknowledging that any road closures scheduled as part of an event will only take place during the time designated for the road closure and that the applicant will not arrive early, fail to clean up or fail to leave promptly after the event so as to interfere with the normal flow of traffic. 
                  (f)  Each application shall be signed and sworn to by the applicant, said signature to be by a partner if for a partnership, or by an officer if for a corporation. 
                  (g)  False statements in any application for a permit shall be grounds for immediate revocation of the permit, and/or denial of the application. 
                  (h)  Omissions of required information in the application shall automatically disqualify any application, but such disqualification will not by itself bar any later application, be it for the same or a different activity. 
                  (i)  Application fee. To offset time, material, and administrative costs, including personnel costs, of processing the application, no application shall be accepted without an accompanying check or money order for $50.00 as an application fee. In the event that the applicant cannot afford the application fee, a pauper's affidavit may be filed by the applicant, seeking to be excused from the fee. Decision on whether the application and permit fee is to be waived shall be made concurrently with the decision on the application itself, and shall be contemporaneously communicated to the applicant. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-1989, § 5; Ord. of 6-1-2009 § 6; Ord. of 12-21-2015, §§ 1, 2) 
                  Sec. 10-24. - Procedure for issuance. 
                  (a)  Review and recommendation. When this article provides for the review of an application for a permit by the city, a copy of the application shall be forwarded to those persons or entities from whom input is needed to assess the propriety of the requested event. 
                  (1)  The persons or entities from whom input is requested on any parade or demonstration application may include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: 
                  a.  The Georgia Department of Transportation; 
                  b.  The Georgia State Patrol; 
                  c.  The Dawson County Sheriff's Department; 
                  d.  Dawson County Emergency Services; and 
                  e.  Any other public officer or entity whose input would bear on the propriety of issuing the requested permit. 
                  (2)  Each person or entity from whom input is sought shall make a recommendation thereon, favorable or otherwise, and shall be requested to return the recommendation to the city within seven days after receiving a copy of the application. 
                  (b)  Action by city. 
                  (1)  The city, via the city administrator or its designee, shall take action upon the application by either approving or denying the permit no later than ten days (fewer if possible) after receiving the completed application, such time being necessary to process the application and obtain needed input from affected local and state agencies. If no action is taken by the city within ten days of the submission of a completed application, the permit is deemed to be granted. 
                  (2)  Form of action. The decision of the city shall be reflected on the face of the application itself in a space provided therefore. Any decision adverse to the applicant must be in writing and explain the reasons for denial. If the application is approved by the city, the city shall issue a permit to the applicant no later than ten days after the submission of a completed application, which permit shall state the nature of the activity authorized and shall bear the date of issuance and the signature of the city administrator or its designee. 
                  (3)  Authority to set sites, routes, schedules, or cancel: 
                  a.  Where more than one permit is sought for the same date or where the proposed route would result in interference with the orderly and free flow of traffic, including pedestrian traffic and emergency vehicles, the city shall have authority to designate reasonable sites and/or routes and set time schedules for the beginning and ending of the activity. The city shall have authority to cancel the permit where the activity fails to begin within a reasonable time after the time set for it to begin based on other activities for which permits have been granted or based on the unreasonable interference caused by such delay with the public welfare, peace, safety, health, and good order. 
                  b.  Where the parade or demonstration may impact traffic on a state route, the Georgia Department of Transportation shall be notified of the potential impact, and input from the Georgia Department of Transportation shall be sought. 
                  (4)  Criteria for approval. Unless one or more of the following situations or circumstances exists, the permit shall be granted: 
                  a.  The proposed activity will create some compelling interference with the rights of nonparticipant citizens, such compelling interference to be expressly noted in the denial of the application; 
                  b.  The proposed activity will unreasonably disrupt the orderly flow of traffic, be it vehicular or pedestrian; 
                  c.  The proposed activity would create an endangerment to citizens of the city, such endangerment to be expressly noted in the denial of the application; 
                  d.  The application is incomplete or contains a material falsehood or misrepresentation; 
                  e.  The city or one of its authorities is sponsoring an event, or a permit has been granted to an earlier applicant, for the same time and place, and no reasonable accommodations can be made to provide for both activities which will not trigger one or more of the other reasons for denying a permit; 
                  f.  Lack of response from an entity from whom input was requested by the city on the parade or demonstration application including, but not limited to, the Dawson County's Sheriff's Department; 
                  g.  There is other compelling interference with the public welfare, peace, safety, health, and good order, such compelling interference to be expressly noted in the denial of the application. 
                  (c)  Restrictions relative to county courthouse. In no event shall any individual, organization, or group of persons be permitted to bring signs, banners, posters, leaflets, handbills, or any other printed material of any size or shape containing any message intended to influence any judge, juror, witness, or other officer in the discharge of his duty within 100 feet of the county courthouse, unless those materials are to be used in a court of law for the purposes of judicial proceedings or functions. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-1989, § 9; Ord. of 6-1-2009 § 7; Ord. of 12-21-2015, §§ 3, 4) 
                  Sec. 10-25. - Financial responsibility and insurance. 
                  (a)  Nothing in this article shall relieve any person, or persons, or organization from responsibility for any injuries or damages to persons or property, private or public, occasioned by their acts or omissions arising from the activity for which any permit under this article was issued. 
                  (b)  Based upon review of the application, the city may require that the applicant be responsible for trash cleanup of affected areas littered during the activity for which a permit is sought, the provision of sufficient parking and storage areas for a large influx of motor vehicles occasioned by the permitted activity, provision of temporary toilet facilities, and other similar special and extraordinary items determined to be necessary for the permitted activity based upon the application's contents. In order to cover the costs of cleanup which often end up being incurred by the city, each applicant granted a permit for an event with anticipated attendance of less than 100 participants shall be required to pay a cleanup deposit of $500.00 for each day of the event. Each applicant granted a permit for an event with anticipated attendance of over 100 participants shall be required to pay cleanup deposit of $1,000.00 for each day of the event. In the event the applicant cannot afford the daily cleanup deposits, a pauper's affidavit may be filed by the applicant, seeking to be excused from the deposits. The decision on whether the daily cleanup deposits are to be waived shall be made concurrently with the decision on the application itself, and shall be contemporaneously communicated to the applicant. The city shall apply the cleanup deposits towards the cost of cleanup following the event. Any portion of the cleanup deposits not used by the city shall be returned to the applicant within ten days of completion of event cleanup. In no event shall the city require individuals, organizations or groups of persons to provide personnel for normal governmental functions, such as traffic control, police protection, or other expenses associated with the maintenance of public order. If additional requirements are placed on applicants in accordance with this subsection, and those requirements are not met despite assurances by the applicant, then failure to comply with the aforementioned requirements shall be grounds for revocation of the issued permit and/or denial of any subsequent permit requested by the applicant. The city shall be entitled to recover against the applicant the sums expended by the city for those extraordinary expenses agreed to but not provided by the applicant. 
                  (c)  Insurance requirements: Applicants for a permit under this article shall be required to obtain insurance for the parade, demonstration, rally, road closing, or other such activity whenever any one or more of the following threshold criteria are met: 
                  (i)  Primary attendance (that is, attendance primarily for said parade, demonstration, rally, road closing, or other such activity, and not attendance which is the result of another event) is reasonably expected to meet or exceed 5,000 persons; 
                  (ii)  The parade, demonstration, rally, road closing, or other such activity will include the use, participation, exhibition, or showing of live animals; 
                  (iii)  The parade, demonstration, rally, road closing, or other such activity will include the use, participation, exhibition, or showing of automobiles of any size or description, motorcycles, tractors or similar conveyances; 
                  (iv)  The parade, demonstration, rally, road closing, or other such activity will include the use or a stage, platforms, bleachers, or grandstands which will be erected for the event; 
                  (v)  The parade, demonstration, rally, road closing, or other such activity will include the use of inflatable apparatus used for jumping, bouncing, or similar activities; 
                  (vi)  The parade, demonstration, rally, road closing, or other such activity shall include the use of roller coasters, bungee jumping, or similar activities; or 
                  (vii)  The parade, demonstration, rally, road closing, or other such activity shall include vendors or concessions. 
                  To comply with this requirement any applicant to whom this section applies shall provide the city with a copy of the declarations page of the applicant's liability insurance in place to cover the event set forth in the permit application. For such events the city shall be added as a named insured for the event on the declarations page by the insurance carrier. Minimum policy limits shall be $1,000,000.00 per person per incident, $2,000,000.00 aggregate for the entire event. All costs for the insurance and adding the city as an additional named insured shall be borne by the applicant. The insurance shall be such as to protect the city from any and all claims of damages to property and/or bodily injury. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-1989, § 3; Ord. of 6-1-2009 § 8; Ord. of 10-5-2009, §§ 1, 2; Ord. of 12-21-2015, §§ 5, 6) 
                  Sec. 10-26. - Appeals. 
                  (a)  Right of appeal. Any applicant whose application for a permit under this article is denied may appeal such denial to the mayor and city council, which shall consider such appeal at the next regularly scheduled meeting following the receipt of the applicant's appeal. 
                  (b)  Consideration of appeal. The mayor and city council shall consider the appeal and require the city administrator to explain why the permit was denied. Unless the aforementioned explanation shows that the decision on the application was properly made in conformance with section 10-24(b)(4) above, the appeal shall be granted and the permit issued. The applicant shall have a right to be heard during this hearing, and shall have the right to be represented by counsel. After hearing the appeal the mayor and city council shall state the reason for granting or denying the appeal in writing within five days of the appeal hearing. This requirement shall not be construed to limit the power of the mayor and council to announce its decision at the conclusion of the appeal hearing, so long as the writing requirement is subsequently satisfied.

                  Any person or organization convicted of a violation of the terms of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine not to exceed $500.00, or by confinement in the jail or correctional institution utilized by the city for a period of time not to exceed 30 days, or both, in the discretion of the municipal court judge.

                  It shall not be a defense to any prosecution under this article for failure to obtain a permit before engaging in any activity described in this article that a permit has in fact been issued unless, at trial (1) the accused produces in court a valid permit or a certified copy thereof, and (2) the permit or a true copy thereof was present at the event for inspection.

                  Sec. 12-59. - Preferred and disfavored location sites. 
                  (a)  Preferred location sites: 
                  (1)  Collocation sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service, or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this article, and collocation sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the city council to be visually obtrusive. 
                  (2)  Publicly used structures. Publicly used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and, due to their institutional or infrastructure uses, are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles, and churches. 
                  (3)  Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility. 
                  (4)  Mixed use buildings in high density districts. Mixed use buildings, i.e., housing above commercial or other residential space, are also preferred location sites. 
                  (b)  Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential structure or site or multifamily duplex shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities.

                  a.  All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 
                  b.  Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation to the city showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  (3)  Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. 
                  (4)  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA, or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary of air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the city council may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  (5)  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this article are met. 
                  (6)  Visual impact. 
                  a.  Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background. 
                  c.  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below, or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. 
                  d.  Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  e.  Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
                  (7)  Landscaping. 
                  a.  Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facilitate from adjacent public ways, public property, and residential property. 
                  b.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  c.  The city council may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms, or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the city council. 
                  (8)  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of such local street. 
                  (9)  Principal, accessory, and joint uses. 
                  a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage, or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility. 
                  b.  Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 
                  (10)  Lot size and setbacks. 
                  a.  The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities; provided, however, that the city council may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby. 
                  1.  Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure. 
                  2.  Towers, guy wires, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
                  3.  Telecommunications facilities must be set back from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 12-56. 
                  b.  For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot-high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact. 
                  (b)  Additional requirements for towers. 
                  (1)  Site location and development shall preserve the pre-existing character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. 
                  (2)  Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 
                  (3)  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (4)  Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable. 
                  (5)  When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to its total height. 
                  (6)  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard, or side yard in a residential district. 
                  (7)  Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter. 
                  (8)  Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access.

                  (d)  Care and maintenance. Tower owners shall at all times employ ordinary and reasonable care and shall install and maintain in use nothing less than commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injuries, or nuisances to the public. Tower owners shall install and maintain towers, telecommunications facilities, wires, cables, fixtures, and other equipment in substantial compliance with the requirements of the National Electric Safety Code and all FCC, state, and local regulations, and in such manner that will not interfere with the use of other property.

If upon inspection by the city manager or his/her duly authorized representative any such telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the above standards as required by this article or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owners shall have 30 days to bring such facility into compliance. In the event such telecommunications facility is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring the telecommunications facility to be removed. In the event such telecommunications facility is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the city may remove such facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state, or otherwise which may have been granted.

                  (3)  All accounts more than 30 days past due from the date on the bill shall bear interest until paid at the rate of one percent per month (12 percent APR) or such other rate as may be set in the future by resolution of the council.

                  (1)  New applicants. A payment plan may be initiated to allow customers making application for new water, sewer, or garbage service to satisfy a past due balance greater than $75.00.

                  c.  Nothing herein tolls the accruing of interest on the unpaid balance or exempts the customer from paying their regular monthly bill on time as the payment plan set forth in this subsection is only for a prior outstanding balance. 
                  (c)  Conditions for reconnection. Service disconnected for nonpayment of bills will be restored only after all outstanding bills are paid in full including the reconnection fees set forth in chapter 2, section 2-110, late fees prescribed in chapter 14, section 14-25(a)(1), and applicable interest charges pursuant to chapter 14, section 14-25(a)(3).

                  Sec. 14-84. - High strength wastewater surcharge 
                  (a)  Establishment of surcharge. Users discharging "high strength" wastewater into the city sewerage system may be assessed a monetary surcharge in addition to the normally required sewer use charges in an amount to be calculated below. A "high strength" wastewater is defined as wastewater which contains any of the following six primary pollutants above the lower levels set forth on a monthly average concentration basis and shall not exceed the maximum level on a daily average concentration basis: 
                  (1)  Five-day 20°C (20 degrees Centigrade) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ) above 350 milligrams per liter (mg/l), not to exceed a maximum of 600 mg/l. 
                  (2)  Chemical oxygen demand (COD) above 700 milligrams per liter (mg/l), not to exceed a maximum of 1,200 mg/l. 
                  (3)  Total ammonium nitrogen NH 3 -N above 30 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 60 mg/l. 
                  (4)  Total TKN above 40 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 80 mg/l. 
                  (5)  Total phosphorus above 20 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 30 mg/l. 
                  (6)  Floatable oil and grease above 100 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 150 mg/l. 
                  The above parameters shall be determined by the utilization of sampling and testing procedures as provided in (d) below. 
                  (b)  Formula. When the concentration of the surcharge parameters exceeds the lower level values shown above, the excess concentration shall be subject to a surcharge in the amount obtained using the following formula: 
                  Surcharge $/month = P × Q × 8.34 × C 
                  Where: 
                  "P" is the excess monthly average concentration in mg/l of the parameter (BOD 5 , etc.) being evaluated i.e. the actual concentration less the allowable lower level concentration listed in paragraph (A). The maximum level concentration shall not be exceeded. 
                  "Q" is equal to the user's monthly flow in millions of gallons. 
                  "C" is equal to the unit cost in dollars per pound ($/lb) for the treatment of the surcharged parameter. This value shall be established by the city based on actual wastewater treatment costs which shall be revised from time to time as necessary. 
                  Since high strength wastewater can inhibit the treatment process, as a penalty the costs per pound shall increase if the pollutant concentration increases above the lower level limit as follows: 

                   
                  (c)  Quantitative measurements of surchargeable parameters. The measurements of the surchargeable parameters shall be conducted as follows: 
                  (1)  Monitoring to determine surcharge shall be conducted by the user as required either in the pretreatment permit or a minimum of two tests per month. The average of all test results will be used to calculate the surcharge. 
                  (2)  Above the required two tests per month, the city may sample the user as often as desired at the city's expense. The city will split the sample with the user at the user's request. 
                  (d)  Sampling and testing procedures. 
                  (1)  The user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportioned sampling is not feasible, the city may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
                  (2)  All wastewater monitoring samples required should be tested by an independent laboratory, with the results submitted to the city on laboratory report sheets. The requirement for utilization of an independent laboratory may be waived by the city when the required tests are performed by the city or other approved agency or when "split" samples are provided to the city and the city's testing results show a reasonably good correlation with the user's in-house testing results. 
                  All measurements, tests and analyses shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater." 
                  (3)  The costs incurred for sampling and testing shall be the responsibility of the customer. 
                  (e)  Billing procedure. Wastewater surcharges as provided for in this section will be included either on the user's regular water and sewer bill or on a separate wastewater surcharge bill.

                  --- (3) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 07-7-6, §§1—28, adopted Aug. 6, 2007, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion herein as Div. 2, §§ 14-101—14-128, was at the discretion of the editor. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

                  Sec. 14-101. - Purpose, intent and declaration of utility. 
                  This division sets forth the requirements for the reuse water system for the City of Dawsonville, Georgia, hereafter referred to as the city. The reuse water system provides an alternative water source for non-potable water demands. It is the city's policy to provide reuse water to the appropriate non-potable demands to limit the growth in requirements for potable water. The objectives of this division are: 
                  (1)  To reduce the potable water demand and extend the life of the existing raw water supplies; and 
                  (2)  To protect the environment by reducing surface water discharges from the city's current treatment facilities. 
                  The city hereby declares and establishes a reuse water utility. The city shall be the exclusive provider of reuse water within the city limits or such larger service area as may be established for the city outside of the city limits by intergovernmental agreement, service delivery strategy agreement or otherwise, whichever is greater. The city shall charge such fees for applications, meters, installation and reuse water use as may be determined by resolution of the mayor and council from time to time based upon the cost to the city for the reuse water utility including, but not limited to, capital, infrastructure, administrative, and operational costs. This division shall apply to all users of the city's water and sewer system.

                  (a)  No duty to provide. Through the broadband utility, the City of Dawsonville shall have the power, but not the obligation, to provide data service to property owners, business owners, residents of the City of Dawsonville and other such persons who desire to have data service through the City of Dawsonville broadband utility while they are in the corporate limits of the city. Nothing contained herein shall require the City of Dawsonville to maintain the provision of a broadband utility should the provision of such utility be determined by the governing authority of the city to not be in the city's best interests. 
                  Additionally, the provision of broadband service in the city shall not create a duty to provide the broadband service to all incorporated parts of the City of Dawsonville. 
                  (b)  Method of providing service. The city may use any method allowed by law to provide service through the broadband utility, to include but not be limited to contracting with third party service providers who may provide the service wirelessly ("Wi-Fi") or through physical connections to a fiber-optic or other form of broadband network.

                  (d)  Suspension or termination of service. 
                  (1)  The department of public works may determine at any time that after having provided broadband utility service it is no longer in the best interests of the utility to provide that service to a particular broadband utility user or users. Such suspension or termination of service may be based upon non-payment for service, violation of the rules and regulations of the broadband utility, changes in the availability of the service, negative impacts on other users of the broadband utility, use of the broadband utility for illegal purposes, any combination of the above or other factors affecting the broadband utility. Notice of the power of the department of public works under this paragraph shall be contained in the application for broadband utility service. 
                  (2)  The City of Dawsonville may determine at any time by a decision of its governing authority that, after having provided broadband utility service, it is no longer in the best interests of the City of Dawsonville to provide broadband utility service as a whole. Notice of the power of the city to suspend or terminate service as described herein shall be contained in the application for broadband utility service.

Once approved, the person or entity receiving the broadband data utility service will be invoiced on a monthly basis by the city for the service rendered at such rates as are established by the governing authority of the city. Rates shall be established by resolution which, upon adoption, shall become part of the rate structure of the City of Dawsonville as codified at article IV of chapter 2 of the Code of Dawsonville, Georgia. 
                  (1)  The governing authority shall have the power to provide for differing rates depending upon the volume of use and type of use for which the applicant seeks broadband utility service. 
                  (2)  The rates charged by the city shall be paid without regard to whether there are fluctuations in the speed of the service or even temporary outages of the broadband utility. 
                  (3)  The city may combine charges for the broadband utility with other invoices it sends for other services provided. 
                  (4)  In addition to the rates charged monthly for broadband utility service, the city shall have the authority to, by resolution, require security deposits prior to providing connection to the broadband utility.

The foregoing notwithstanding, in the event that the city provides its broadband utility service through an agreement with a third party data service provider, the public works department shall coordinate decisions on applications for service with the third party provider to determine, among other things, the speed of the service at the applied-for location, the strength of any signal at the applied for location, and the effect, if any, that approval of the application may have on other subscribers to the broadband utility. 
                  (2)  The city reserves the right to deny service for any reason permissible under the law, including but not limited to situations where data speed is not sufficient, strength of signal is not sufficient, or where the approval of an application for service may have a negative impact on the provision of broadband utility service to other utility subscribers.

                  (Ord. of 7-11-2005, § 18-90) 
                  Sec. 102-61. - Enforcement procedure. 
                  (a)  Whenever a request is filed with the city by a public authority or by at least five residents of the municipality charging a violation of this article, or whenever it appears to the director by his own observation that any premises or structure violates the terms of this article, the director shall conduct a preliminary investigation of such charges. If the preliminary investigation discloses an emergency situation or a nuisance per se (section 102-57), the director may take immediate action to resolve the situation or abate the nuisance and the cost of same shall constitute a lien as set forth hereinbelow. If the investigation discloses a basis for such charges (but is not an emergency or nuisance per se), then the director shall provide written notice of the violation by hand delivery or via U.S. Mail to the owner and any parties in interest of the premises or structure at their last known address, or if none, at the address listed on the records of the Dawson County Tax Commissioner for the premises or structure at issue. The written notice provided by the director shall contain a description of the specific violation charged, and shall include a copy of this article. 
                  (b)  Upon receipt of the written notice of violation, the owner and any party of interest of the structure or premises shall have five days from the date of the written notice to object in writing to the alleged violation. If no objection is received by the city within five days, the violation shall be deemed proven, the structure or premises declared in violation, and action taken as set forth herein below. If an objection is received by the city within five days, the objection shall be reviewed by the director and if upon review the director determines no violation has been proven, the notice of violation shall be dismissed. However, if despite review of the objection the director determines a violation has been proven, the structure or premises shall be declared in violation and action taken as set forth herein below. 
                  (c)  If the violation is deemed proven, the director shall issue and serve by hand delivery or via U.S. Mail the owner and any party of interest an administrative order. Except in the case of a violation of sections 102-57 or 102-58, the administrative order shall allow the owner of the premises or structure up to 90 days to cure the violation before any fine is assessed pursuant to subsection (d) below. The administrative order shall be issued according to the following criteria: 
                  (1)  Violations concerning structures: 
                  a.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of a structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the structure, the administrative order shall require the owner or parties in interest to repair, alter, or improve the structure so as to render it fit for human habitation or for current commercial, industrial, or business use within a specified time as is reasonable to accomplish the repair, alteration or improvement. Or, in the alternative, the administrative order may allow the owner or parties in interest to vacate and close the structure to all human habitation, commercial, industrial or business use; or 
                  b.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of such structure cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the structure, the administrative order shall require the owner or parties in interest to remove or demolish such structure within a reasonable specified time. In no event shall the administrative order require removal or demolition of any structure except upon a finding that the cost of repair, alteration, or improvement thereof exceeds one-half the value the structure will have when repaired. 
                  (2)  Violations concerning premises: When the violation concerns the repair, alteration, or improvement of premises, the administrative order shall require the owner or parties in interest to repair, alter, or improve the premises so as to render it fit for its current residential, commercial, industrial or business use. Or, in the alternative, the administrative order may allow the owner or parties in interest to vacate and close the premises to all human habitation, commercial, industrial or business use. 
                  (d)  If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with an administrative order to repair, alter, improve, vacate, close or demolish such structure or premises in accordance with the administrative order:

                  (Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. II, § 5) 
                  Sec. 105-6. - Building permit required. 
                  (a)  For any monument sign, pylon sign, or any sign connected to electrical power, a building permit is required before posting, displaying, substantially changing, or erecting such signs, unless such signs are otherwise specifically exempted from regulation by this chapter. 
                  (b)  The applicant for a building permit shall submit application materials as specified by the director of the department of planning and zoning, including a sketch or print drawn to scale showing pertinent information such as wind pressure requirements and display materials in accordance with the Standard Building Code. 
                  (c)  Signs requiring a building permit shall comply with all applicable construction codes, including but not limited to building codes and electrical codes, which are effective in the City of Dawsonville at the time the building permit is sought. 
                  (d)  Building permit fees shall be as set forth in the Zoning and Building Regulation Code of the City of Dawsonville Code of Ordinances.

                  Sec. 105-7. - Process for issuance of sign permits. 
                  (a)  The director of planning and zoning shall be authorized to issue all sign permits which are in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The city shall process all sign permit applications within 30 days of the city's actual receipt of (1) a complete sign permit application and (2) the sign permit fee. In the event an applicant makes a revision to the application after receipt but before it is processed by the city, the 30-day period shall run from the date that the revision is received by the city. For purposes of this section only, the term "process" shall mean to (1) make a decision on sign permit applications that can be administratively approved or denied, or (2) bind over the decision on the sign permit application to the mayor and council of the City of Dawsonville. In no event, except with written permission of the applicant, may the director of planning and zoning delay processing a sign permit application. The failure to process a sign permit application within 30 days of the city's actual receipt of a completed sign permit application (as revised, if applicable) accompanied by the sign permit fee and building permit fee (if applicable) without the written permission of the applicant shall result in the sign permit request being automatically granted. 
                  (b)  For the purpose of administering and issuing approved sign permits, such permits shall be issued in writing, and may be obtained from the department of planning and zoning during its hours of operation once the sign permit has been approved. 
                  (c)  The director of planning and zoning shall reject any application containing any omissions, false statements, or which is not accompanied by the applicable sign permit fee and building permit fee (if applicable). The director of planning and zoning shall deny any application which, in his determination, fails to comply with the requirements of this chapter, or which fails to seek a variance required for the sign to be permitted as proposed. Any rejected or denied application later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of re-submission, instead of original submission date. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an application containing a false material statement or omission, the director of planning and zoning shall revoke said application and the subject sign shall be removed. A revocation pursuant to this section shall be appealable pursuant to this article. 
                  (d)  It is understood that certain signs may not fall strictly into the parameters established by the specifications of this chapter. These cases must be considered in relationship to the stated goals and intent of the entire ordinance. The director of planning and zoning shall have the authority to make decisions on all applications based upon specifications of this chapter relative to the intent, goals, and purposes of this chapter. 
                  (e)  Administrative approval and denial. 
                  (1)  For the purpose of administering this chapter, permit applications which can be "administratively approved" are those which, in the determination of the director of planning and zoning, comply with all requirements of this chapter and which do not require any variances from the terms and performance standards of this chapter. For the purpose of administering this chapter, permit applications which can be "administratively denied" are those which, in the determination of the director of planning and zoning, fail to comply with all requirements of the ordinance or which would require a variance from the terms or performance standards of this chapter, but the applicant failed to apply for any such variance. 
                  (2)  In the following circumstances, the director of planning and zoning may bind over a decision on a sign permit application to the mayor and council of the City of Dawsonville: 
                  a.  The director is unable to reach a determination as to whether the application complies with the terms of this chapter. 
                  b.  The application seeks variances to the terms or performance standards of this chapter which will require the approval of the mayor and council in any event. 
                  (f)  Decisions bound over. In the event that the director of planning and zoning binds over a decision on a sign permit application to the mayor and council of the City of Dawsonville, then the following procedures shall control: 
                  (1)  The mayor and council shall hold a public hearing on the sign permit application request at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the mayor and council of the city. At this same hearing, the mayor and council shall hear any and all variance requests related or pertaining to the sign permit application. Public comment on the sign permit application and any variances related to the same shall be limited to ten minutes for those speaking in favor of the sign, and ten minutes for those speaking in opposition to the sign. 
                  (2)  At the conclusion of the public hearing, the mayor and council shall render a decision on the sign permit application, and in so doing shall direct the director of planning and zoning for the city to either issue the permit, issue the permit with conditions, or deny the permit. The director of planning and zoning shall comply with the directive of the mayor and council within two business days of the meeting at which the decision on the application was made. 
                  (g)  Appeals of decisions made pursuant to this section may be filed in accordance with section 105-8. 
                  (Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. II, § 7; Ord. of 6-16-2014; Ord. of 9-8-2014) 
                  Sec. 105-8. - Appeals and variances authorized. 
                  (a)  Any person aggrieved by any decision of the director of planning and zoning or other official with authority to administer or interpret this code may be taken to the zoning board of appeals for the City of Dawsonville. Such appeals shall be filed with the zoning board of appeal within ten business days of the date of the decision appealed. Unless inconsistent with the procedures outlined by this chapter, such appeals will follow the requirements and procedures defined in the Zoning Ordinance of the city. Where the denial of any sign permit is appealed, it shall be set down for consideration at the next meeting of the zoning board of appeals. A final determination shall be issued by the appellate body within 60 days from the date that the appeal is formally filed in writing by the sign applicant. Appeal from the decision of the zoning board of appeals shall be filed with the Superior Court of Dawson County. 
                  (b)  Variances to the performance standards delineated in this chapter may be granted by the mayor and council of the city if sought by the applicant for a sign needing such a variance. Variances must be requested on forms provided by the department of planning and zoning, and are subject to such additional fees as may be set by the mayor and council of the city from time to time. Variances will be considered by the mayor and council along with the permitting procedures discussed in section 105-7. 
                  (1)  A variance may be granted in an individual case of extreme and unusual hardship upon a finding by the city council that the following conditions exist: 
                  a.  There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area. 
                  b.  The failure of the city council to allow a variance would deprive the applicant of a right currently enjoyed by other similar properties in the city. 
                  c.  Granting the variance request will not confer upon the property of the applicant significant privileges which are denied to other similar properties in the city. 
                  d.  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare. 
                  e.  The variance is not a request to permit a type of sign which otherwise is not permitted in the zoning districts involved. 
                  (2)  Variances will only be permitted to add, at maximum, ten feet to the height of a sign. 
                  (c)  The variance application fee shall be $300.00 or such other amount as may be determined by the mayor and council by resolution.

                  Sec. 105-9. - Sign permit expiration date. 
                  A sign permit shall become null and void if the construction or installation of the sign for which the permit was issued has not been completed within 12 months after the date of issuance. No refunds will be made for a permit after the permit is issued. If an individual or entity desires to erect a sign at the same location after the expiration of a permit, a new application for the sign must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule and sign ordinance applicable at such time.

                  Sec. 105-10. - Inspection. 
                  The director of planning and zoning, or his designee, shall have the right to inspect all existing and future signs in the City of Dawsonville to determine (1) whether such signs are in compliance with this chapter (or in the case of legal nonconforming signs such ordinance as governs said signs) and (2) whether the signs are in such condition as is conducive to maintain the public's health, safety, and welfare. All signs which are found to be in an unsafe condition in the determination of the director of planning and zoning shall be addressed in accord with section 105-17.

                  (a)  Violation of any provision of this article shall be grounds for terminating the sign permit granted by the city to the owner. 
                  (b)  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no permit shall be suspended, revoked or canceled except for cause as hereinafter defined. Prior to any such action, the permittee shall be granted a public hearing before the mayor and council of the city at its next regularly scheduled meeting, if sufficient time exists to provide notice to the permittee pursuant to subsection (d) below, and if not, then at the following regularly scheduled meeting. 
                  (c)  "For cause" is defined as the violation of any provision of this chapter. 
                  (d)  The permittee will be given at least ten days written notice mailed to the address on file with the city for the sign of the time, place and purpose of any public hearing at which its sign permit may be suspended, revoked, or canceled, with a statement of the reason for the proposed action. 
                  (e)  The termination of the permit does not in any way preclude the person or persons alleged to have violated the provisions of this chapter from being assessed fines under the terms of this chapter, tried under the enforcement provisions of this chapter, nor does it preclude the city from taking any other action authorized by the Code of the City of Dawsonville, Georgia, and/or any other action authorized by law.

                  It is the intent of this chapter to establish reasonable time periods for the removal of discontinued signs. 
                  (1)  Generally: 
                  a.  For purposes of this section, all signs pertaining to a business, service, institution, industry, or other activity that ceases operations shall be deemed to be discontinued signs. 
                  b.  For purposes of this section, "ceases operations" shall refer to those situations where there is substantial evidence that a business or activity has vacated the building or grounds; provided further that this section shall not apply to any case where a business or activity is temporarily suspended and there is evidence that the business or activity will resume operations within a specifically designated period. 
                  c.  It shall be the responsibility of the property owner, the operator of a business or activity discontinuing a lease if any, and the leasehold manager if any, to ensure compliance with the provisions of this section and each such person or entity shall be considered individually responsible for compliance with this section. 
                  (2)  All discontinued signs, with the exception of pylon signs and monument signs, shall be removed within 30 days from the date of discontinuance. The director of planning and zoning may permit an extension of this removal period only in cases where special equipment is needed to remove the sign and removal of the structure cannot reasonably be arranged by the sign owner within the 30-day time period. 
                  (3)  All discontinued signs that meet the definition of a pylon sign shall be removed within 60 days from the date of discontinuance. The director of planning and zoning may permit one 30-day extension of this removal period only in cases where special equipment is needed to remove the sign or sign structures, and removal of the structure cannot reasonably be arranged by the sign owner within the 60-day time period. 
                  (4)  This section shall not apply to the structure of a monument sign, provided that it might reasonably be used by a future tenant or property owner, complies with the provisions of this chapter, and the sign is maintained in good condition; provided further, that the following shall be met: 
                  a.  If a discontinued monument sign contains a message panel that is removable from the monument structure without disassembling the monument, then within 30 days of the date of discontinuance said panel shall be removed and the portion of the monument structure that previously held the message panel shall be covered with durable cloth, canvas or other suitable material for the pertinent sign which material shall be approved by the director of planning and zoning to avoid the appearance of blight, until such time as a new sign permit is applied for and granted and an approved sign panel is installed in said monument. 
                  b.  If a discontinued monument sign contains a sign copy area that is not removable without disassembling the monument, then said sign copy area shall be modified (e.g., painted over or covered with durable cloth, canvas or other suitable material for the pertinent sign which material shall be approved by the director of planning and zoning), so that the sign copy pertaining to the business or activity discontinued is no longer visible, until such time as a new sign permit is applied for and granted and approved sign copy is affixed on the sign copy area of said monument.

                  Sec. 105-13. - Maintenance of signs. 
                  (a)  Removal of signs not maintained: All signs shall be maintained by the property owner in good condition so as to present a safe condition, as well as a neat and orderly appearance. The director of planning and zoning or his designee will give the owner 30 days written notice to correct the deficiencies or to remove the sign or signs, except signs which pose a threat to public safety which shall be removed in accord with section 105-17. Said written notice may be made by U.S. Mail sent to the permit holder and owner of the property upon which the sign is located at the address on file with the city. The director of the department of planning and zoning may remove or cause to be removed after written notice to the permit holder and property owner at the address on file with the city any sign that has not been timely removed after being discontinued as set forth in section 105-12, or which shows gross neglect, becomes dilapidated, or in the opinion of the director or his designees poses a threat to public safety. If the owner refuses to correct the deficiencies or remove the sign, the director of planning and zoning or his designee will have the sign removed, and the city shall be entitled to a lien for the cost of removal against the lot or parcel upon which the sign existed before removal. 
                  (b)  Maintaining messages and copy on signs: Signs may not lack copy or a message for in excess of 30 days. In the event a sign lacks copy or a message for in excess of 30 days, the owner of said sign shall cause the sign to bear copy or a message, cover the sign as provided supra or remove the sign. It is the intent of this provision to avoid the visual blight which accompanies vacant and unmaintained sign copy and/or messages.

                  Sec. 105-14. - Relocation costs. 
                  (a)  As to all signs permitted after the effective date of this chapter amendment, the owner of the land, the permit holder, their successors and assigns shall and by applying for a permit agree to be responsible for all costs of relocation of said sign and shall waive any claim for the value of the land with a sign located upon it in the event that any road or right-of-way is expanded in the City of Dawsonville that necessitates relocation or loss of the sign at the permitted location. 
                  (b)  All permits issued for signs under this chapter shall be conditioned upon the land owner, permit holder and their successors and assigns being bound to incur said relocation costs and waiving any claim of damages or vested rights in the sign due to road or right-of-way expansion which requires relocation or total loss of the sign. All sign permit applications and all sign permits shall have the following legend imprinted thereon: Acceptance of this permit and erection of the sign approved herewith shall irrevocably bind the owner of the land, the permit holder, their successors and assigns (hereinafter collectively the "permit holder") to pay any and all costs of relocation of the sign in the event that the city or other governmental entity expands the road or right-of-way adjacent to the sign. The permit holder agrees that it acquires no vested rights in the sign on the property location and agrees to make no claim for condemnation, inverse condemnation or other loss or damage as a result of the inability of permit holder to maintain a sign at this location. The permit holder agrees that the permit is a conditional license that may be revoked by the city at any time due to the need for road or other utility improvements, and that the permit holder has taken all of these factors into consideration when buying or leasing the land upon which the sign will be located and when designing, constructing and maintaining the sign.

                  Sec. 105-15. - Enforcement. 
                  This article shall be administered and enforced by the director of planning and zoning or his or her designee as follows: 
                  (1)  In case any sign is proposed to be erected, constructed, altered, converted, or used in violation of any provision of this article, the director of planning and zoning may, in addition to other remedies, and after notice to the appropriate person, issue a citation for violation of the city ordinance thereby requiring the presence of the violator in municipal court; institute the filing of a petition for an injunction, or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, alteration, conversion, or use to correct or abate such violation. 
                  (2)  The director of planning and zoning may have the sign removed at the expense of the owner and may issue a citation for violation of the city ordinance to the owner, the person or entity erecting, installing or placing the sign, as well as those parties whose name, message, and/or address, and/or telephone number appear on the sign. 
                  a.  Before removing a sign, the director of planning and zoning shall give written notice via U.S. Mail of the pending removal to the permit holder and property owner upon whose property the sign is located at the addresses on file with the city. 
                  b.  In the event that any or all of the aforementioned entities or individuals are not readily ascertainable by the director of planning and zoning, then the sign may be removed without such attempt at notice being required. 
                  (3)  Any sign located within a public street right-of-way may be removed immediately by the city without warning or notice to the sign owner. 
                  (4)  All costs of enforcement shall be paid by the sign owner, the permittee, and/or the property owner, shall constitute a lien upon the lot or parcel upon which the sign existed, and shall be paid in full with interest at the legal statutory rate prior to any new sign permits being issued for that lot or parcel.

                  Sec. 105-17. - Nonconforming signs and threats to public safety. 
                  Nonconforming signs that met all legal requirements when erected may stay in place until the deterioration of the sign or damage to the sign makes it a threat to public safety, and no repairs have been effected within 30 days of written notice via U.S. Mail to the permit holder and property owner from the director of planning and zoning directing that immediate repairs are necessary to protect public safety. Any sign removed in accord with this section, or sections 105-13 and 105-15, shall not be replaced except through a new application under the then current sign ordinance.

                  Sec. 105-33. - Sign requirements per zoning district. 
                  Any sign regulated by this chapter shall comply with the requirements outlined for the zoning district category in which the sign is located. 
                  (Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. III, § 3) 
                  Sec. 105-34. - Sign devices allowed for up to ninety days. 
                  The following types of signs shall be permitted only by issuance of a sign permit, and a building permit and electrical permit if required, allowing usage of this type sign for a period not exceeding 90 consecutive days, except as more specifically provided in this section.

                  Sec. 105-35. - Weekend signs. 
                  Weekend signs shall be allowed without the necessity of obtaining a permit, subject to the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Such signs shall be allowed only on Fridays from 12:00 p.m. through Mondays until 12:00 p.m. 
                  (2)  No more than one weekend sign shall be allowed on any given lot. 
                  (3)  No such sign shall be located on any public right-of-way, and it must be on private property with the consent of the property owner. 
                  (4)  Signs shall not exceed a maximum area of 15 square feet each. 
                  (5)  For identification purposes the owner of said sign shall stamp or write legibly its name and contact information, on the backside or in a corner or margin of the sign. 
                  (6)  In order to confirm legitimacy of sign placement, the owner of every weekend sign shall stamp or write legibly on the backside or corner of the sign the name of the property owner providing authorization for placement of the sign and a telephone number of that property owner. 
                  (7)  Such signs shall not be illuminated. 
                  (8)  The minimum fine for placement of a weekend sign in contravention of this article shall be $100.00. For enforcement purposes, each sign placed in contravention of this article is a separate violation. 
                  (9)  For purposes of prosecuting this chapter, it is hereby established that if the subject matter of a wrongfully placed weekend sign is a business, individual or entity subject to identification, then a rebuttable presumption exists that the business, individual or entity so identified caused the sign to be so placed and is subject to citation.

                  Sec. 105-36. - Expression signs. 
                  Expression signs are governed by O.C.G.A. § 16-7-58, and shall be allowed without the necessity of obtaining a permit, if in compliance with the size requirements of the applicable zoning district and subject to the following: 
                  (1)  No such sign shall be located on any public right-of-way, and it must be on private property with the consent of the property owner. 
                  (2)  For identification purposes the owner of said sign shall stamp or write legibly its name and contact information on the backside or in a corner or margin of the sign. 
                  (3)  In order to confirm legitimacy of sign placement, the owner of every expression sign shall stamp or write legibly on the backside or corner of the sign the name of the property owner or tenant providing authorization for placement of the sign and a telephone number of that property owner. 
                  (4)  In order to prevent visual pollution and safety issues caused by the distraction of those passing by, no more than two expression signs per lot containing the same or similar expressive messages shall be allowed without a permit. For example, in a political race, a maximum of two political campaign signs supporting the same candidate for the same office shall be allowed per lot. This provision is not intended to limit the overall number of expression signs per lot. For example, in a political campaign season, one lot may permissibly contain more than two political signs, as long as no more than two signs contain the same or similar expressive message supporting the same candidate for the same office. This provision is in no way intended to regulate the content of expression signs, but is rather a measure to reasonably limit the duplication of the same message in a manner that creates visual blight and causes distraction to those passing by. 
                  (5)  Expression signs are subject to the additional regulations, if any, of the zoning district in which the sign is placed. 
                  (Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. III, § 6)

                  (Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. III, § 7) 
                  Sec. 105-38. - Exemptions. 
                  The following types of signs are specifically exempted from compliance with this article and are not subject to a permit requirement and review/approval by the director of planning and zoning: 
                  (1)  One "no solicitors" sign, not to exceed one square foot in sign area, is allowed per major entrance to any building or apartment complex.

                  (9)  Expression signs (no permit required if in compliance with the size requirements of the applicable zoning district). 
                  (10)  Signs notifying the public that the lot or parcel upon which the sign is placed is for sale or lease (no permit required if in compliance with the size requirements of the applicable zoning district). 
                  (11)  Improper use of nonregulated signs. If the director of planning and zoning and/or the mayor and council deem that any business is using nonregulated signage to circumvent any other provision of this chapter, they shall have the authority to consider such sign as being in violation of this article.

                  (1)  The maximum height for signs shall not exceed six feet.

                  (b)  Performance standards. 
                  (1)  The maximum height for freestanding signs shall not exceed 15 feet and such sign shall not exceed 100 square feet in sign area. 
                  (2)  There shall be no more than one freestanding sign per lot. 
                  (3)  The maximum height for monument signs shall not exceed ten feet and such sign shall not exceed a maximum sign area of 25 square feet per side with a maximum of two sides.

                  c.  The dimensions of the sign face shall not exceed 15 feet in height and 32 feet in length, with or without trim. 
                  d.  No billboard shall rotate or have any moving parts. 
                  e.  The minimum separation required between two billboard signs shall not be less than 1,500 feet as distance is defined by this chapter. 
                  f.  No billboard shall be located within 1,500 feet of any residential community.

                  (Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. III, § 10; Ord. of 6-16-2014; Ord. of 9-8-2014) 
                  Sec. 105-41. - Temporary signage. 
                  (a)  It is the policy of the city as outlined in this article to regulate the use of temporary signage. Temporary signage is often poorly constructed, poorly maintained, and located in a manner than obscures traffic signs, views of intersections of public and private streets and driveways, and tends to depreciate the scenic beauty and quality of life of the community by creating visual clutter. Temporary signage has a place in the community for specialized purposes, such as announcing properties for sale or lease, construction activities, or temporary sales. Temporary signage is permitted subject to the regulations of this article. 
                  (b)  Temporary signs are those signs which are installed with the intent of displaying them continuously for more than 24 hours, but which are not related to a permanent land use on the property and are not intended to be displayed permanently. Temporary signs are permitted subject to the following regulations on size, placement and location: 
                  (1)  Size. Temporary signs shall not exceed five square feet in area. 
                  (2)  Location. Temporary signs are permitted, provided that they are located in minimum of 20 feet back from the edge of the curb, or edge of pavement where there is no curb, of the street on which the sign fronts. If this 20-foot distance would be within a structure, the sign may be within three feet of the front of the structure. Signs must be parallel to the streets on which the building fronts and placed in front of the front facade with the building as a backdrop. Signs may be positioned in the side yard. Signs may be displayed through windows or other glass areas. On vacant lots, where there is no structure, the sign shall be approximately centered on the lot, and shall maintain the 20-foot setback from the edge of the curb or edge of pavement where there is no curb. 
                  (3)  Height. No portion of the sign shall extend more than five feet above the existing ground level at the location of the sign. Mounting devices may extend above the sign by not more than six inches. 
                  (4)  Number. Only one temporary sign is permitted on any one parcel of property. To the extent that any restriction contained herein is inconsistent with state law, said state law shall control. 
                  (5)  Mounting devices. Temporary signs shall be mounted on hardware of wood or painted metal, and no part of the mounting structure shall be greater than four inches by four inches in cross-section. Mounting hardware shall be painted or stained in earth tones. Further, no message may be written on the mounting hardware so that the entire message area of the sign is contained on the sign face itself. 
                  (6)  Lighting prohibited. No temporary sign may be illuminated in any manner. 
                  (7)  Time and fees. Temporary signs shall only be permitted for a one-month time period which may be renewed for up to 12 months total and shall pay a fee of $30.00 per month or such fee as may be established from time to time by resolution of the mayor and council of the city. 
                  (8)  Maintenance. Temporary signs shall be maintained as provided in this chapter, and it shall be a violation of this article to permit a temporary sign to fall into disrepair. 
                  (9)  Exceptions. Where there are conditions such as heavy vegetation on the property, or extremely steep terrain that makes the sign placement standards of this section impractical because the sign is not visible from the street, the city may grant an exception of the sign setback standards, but not the size or street orientation standards. In no event may temporary signs subject to the setback requirements be placed within the public right-of-way.

                  Sec. 105-42. - Banners—Over public property. 
                  All applications to display banners over public property shall be approved as outlined below. Specifically, in order to receive approval to display a sign or banner over public property, the applicant shall meet the following terms and conditions: 
                  (1)  The banner or sign shall only inform the community of an upcoming community event. A community event shall be defined as a public event which is of interest to the community as a whole rather than the promotion of any product, political candidate, religious leader, or commercial goods or services. 
                  (2)  The banner may only be displayed immediately prior to and during a community event which it advertises, and in no case shall the banner be displayed for more than 30 days or more than ten days after the event. 
                  (3)  Banners shall only be displayed at the site approved by the director of planning and zoning. 
                  (4)  Reservation of dates for a banner site may be made up to three months prior to the date of display. Sites are generally reserved on a first-come, first-served basis; however, preference may be given for recurring annual events, historically or traditionally tied to a specific date, holiday, or season. Additionally, a request to advertise the reoccurrence of the same event or same type of event within any one calendar year (i.e., plays or class registration) may be honored if no request for the banner site for an unrepeated scheduling is received. 
                  (5)  All banners crossing over public thoroughfares shall be hung by city personnel and must meet the following specifications: 
                  a.  Maximum banner dimensions over public property shall not exceed four feet by 30 feet. 
                  b.  Day-glo or fluorescent colors shall not be allowed. 
                  c.  Banners shall be constructed of durable canvas or similar type weather-resistant fabric. 
                  d.  Banners must be slit to reduce wind resistance. 
                  e.  Banners must be reinforced with rope within a casing at the bottom of the banner edge. 
                  f.  Each corner of the banner must have a grommet and a lead of one-quarter-inch rope from each corner no less than four feet long. 
                  g.  Banners must have a minimum of seven grommets (including the two corner grommets) across the top edge, which allows the banner to be attached to a cable. 
                  h.  An additional 150 feet of one-quarter-inch rope is required to hang each banner and shall be provided to the city by the applicant or sponsor of the banner. 
                  (6)  The primary purpose of banners which extend over public property shall be to advertise and inform of upcoming community events. No more than five percent of each side of the banner space shall be used for the name or logo of a commercial sponsor. 
                  (7)  Prices or fees charged for the event shall not be displayed. 
                  (8)  Banners shall be hung or displayed in a manner that does not interfere with or impede traffic or interfere with or obscure traffic signs or control devices. 
                  (9)  The owners of a banner shall agree to assume full liability and indemnify the city for any damage to persons or property arising from the display of the banner by the city. 
                  (10)  If the banner is not picked up from the city by the applicant or sponsor within ten days after it has been taken down, the banner shall become the property of the city and will be disposed of. 
                  (11)  Banners should be received by the city one week prior to the date of scheduled display. 
                  (12)  The city is not responsible for any damage that may occur to the banner from any cause. 
                  (13)  No banner may be hung over a state highway absent written permission from the Georgia Department of Transportation. 
                  A fee shall be payable to the city when the banner is dropped off at the city before its reservation commences to cover manpower costs associated with installation and removal of the banner. A fee of $30.00 per month, or as may be established from time to time by resolution of the mayor and council of the city, shall be charged and must be paid for each banner sign permit.

                  Sec. 105-43. - Banners—On city light standards. 
                  The city manager or his/her designee is authorized to administer the placement of banners on city light standards. Approval of all applications to display banners on city light standards shall be given by the city only if all conditions in this article are met. Banners displayed in the city area shall be those sponsored by, designed for and commissioned by, fabricated for, and installed by the direction of the city.

                  Banners shall be permissible only by issuance of a sign permit, allowing usage of this type of sign for a period not exceeding one year. All banners must be set back at least ten feet from any public right-of-way. 
                  (1)  Duration. There shall be two types of sign permits available for banners: annual and quarterly. An annual permit shall last for one year, while a quarterly permit shall last for three months.

                  (Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. IV, § 1) 
                  Sec. 105-72. - Sign permit required. 
                  Except as specifically exempted from the provisions of this article, it shall be unlawful for any person to post, display, substantially change, or erect a sign in the historical district or the urban redevelopment plan area of the city without first having obtained a sign permit. For purposes of this article, application for a sign permit, a building permit, or a business license may be made simultaneously. 
                  (Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. IV, § 2) 
                  Sec. 105-73. - Types of signs allowed. 
                  The following types of signs are allowed subject to city review and approval based upon the regulations and payment of fees set forth in this article: 
                  (1)  Freestanding signs. 
                  a.  Height limit. Freestanding signs are limited to low-profile signs which may not exceed a height of five feet. 
                  b.  Design. Freestanding monument signs with solid or enclosed bases are permitted where approved. Signs supported by at least two poles without enclosed based are also permitted, provided that the exposed poles' height does not constitute more than 50 percent of the overall height; i.e., the height of the open area beneath a sign cannot exceed 50 percent of the sign's total height. Single pole signs are not considered appropriate in the historical district or the urban redevelopment plan area except in the case where a single pole is used in conjunction with a horizontal cross-bar to support hanging signs on one side of the pole only subject to the projection and clearance provisions defined in subsection [105-74(9)]. 
                  c.  Size. Freestanding signs shall be limited to a maximum of 32 square feet in area. 
                  d.  Density. Businesses, projects, or parcels are limited to one freestanding sign, except that properties with more than 100 feet of continuous frontage and with more than one entrance may, subject to city approval, install a freestanding sign at each entrance, provided that the combined square footage of all freestanding signs does not exceed 64 square feet (two 32-square-foot signs). Where there is frontage on more than one street, each frontage is treated independently, provided that no two signs may be closer than 100 feet to one another. Signage area may not be transferred from one frontage to another. 
                  e.  Location and orientation. Freestanding signs are subject to the location requirements of the city. 
                  f.  Content. Freestanding signs are limited to on-premises signs and signs displaying noncommercial messages. 
                  (2)  Window signs. Permanent window signs may be placed in or upon any window, provided that no more than 75 percent of the total transparent area of the window or windows combined is obscured. 
                  (3)  Wall signs. Wall signs may be placed upon a building; provided, that they meet the size, material, content, location, and other standards of this article. Wall signs shall be placed so as to utilize existing architectural features of a building without obscuring them. Wall signs shall be oriented toward pedestrians or vehicles within close proximity. 
                  (4)  Projecting signs. No single projecting sign may exceed 18 square feet in area or may project more than 36 inches from the face of the building to which it is attached. Projecting signs must have at least eight feet of ground clearance and cannot be higher than the building to which they are attached. Signs may extend over city property or state right-of-way only with the written approval of the city council. 
                  (5)  Hanging signs. A hanging sign may be placed on a building or underneath an approved canopy, awning, or colonnade as long as it does not project beyond the same. It must have a least eight feet of ground clearance. Signs may extend over city property or state right-of-way only with the written approval of the city council. 
                  (6)  Awnings. Awnings are permitted as signage, provided they blend with the architecture of the building and do not obscure details of the building. Awnings should serve as an accent to the building's design but should not be the dominant architectural feature. Awnings are counted as signage if they have lettering or other graphics. 
                  a.  Signage area. Only 20 percent of any one face of an awning may be used for signage regardless of the size of the building facade to which the sign applies. 
                  b.  Material. Only canvas will be permitted. Material should be high quality, colorfast, and surface resistant. Vinyl or plastic materials are not considered appropriate. 
                  c.  Color. Awning colors are generally limited to a single field color with a single contrasting color for lettering and may be used only if they conform to color requirements as specified in section 105-74 of this article. 
                  d.  Illumination. Illuminated (backlit) translucent awnings or translucent letters on opaque backgrounds are not appropriate and are not permitted. Canvas awnings illuminated in the traditional manner with incandescent lighting are permitted. 
                  e.  Clearance and projection. Awnings must have a minimum of eight feet of clearance from the ground to the frame or valance. 
                  f.  Location of awnings. Awnings must be located in a traditional manner above doors and windows. All other locations are prohibited. 
                  (7)  Illuminated signs. Illuminated signs are permitted subject to the provisions of subsection 105-74(f). 
                  (8)  Changeable copy signs. Changeable copy signs may only be used in conjunction with theaters, entertainment facilities, nonprofit art galleries, or similar exhibit facilities permitted in the historical district. Changeable copy signs are allowed for all facilities in the urban redevelopment plan area. 
                  (9)  Directory signs. Directory signs shall be permitted to provide information for multitenant projects. Multitenant projects may have a maximum of 32 square feet of signage area to serve as a directory for a project. The contents of such signs shall be limited to the name of the tenants of the project, address or suite number, and telephone numbers. Signs shall be located in the common area of the project and oriented toward a central pedestrian path or common parking area. No rental or sales information shall be permitted on the directory sign. A directory sign does not constitute a primary or secondary sign. 
                  (10)  Menu display. Menus for restaurants may be displaced on the inside of windows of a restaurant or inside a wall-mounted box. The maximum size shall be three square feet. If a display box is used, it must be constructed to coordinate with the building design, must contain a clear face which would protect the menu from the weather, and must not extend over public property. Chalk or erasable boards are exempt from the clear face coverage requirement. A menu display does not constitute a primary or secondary sign. If any information other than the menu is incorporated into the menu display, then this would constitute a primary or secondary sign. 
                  (12)  Temporary signs. Temporary signs are permitted subject to the requirements of section 105-75. 
                  (13)  Expression signs. Expression signs are governed by O.C.G.A. § 16-7-58, and shall be allowed without the necessity of obtaining a permit, subject to the following: 
                  a.  No such sign shall be located on any public right-of-way, and it must be on private property with the consent of the property owner. 
                  b.  For identification purposes the owner of said sign shall stamp or write legibly its name and contact information on the backside or in a corner or margin of the sign. 
                  c.  In order to confirm legitimacy of sign placement, the owner of every expression sign shall stamp or write legibly on the backside or corner of the sign the name of the property owner providing authorization for placement of the sign and a telephone number of that property owner. 
                  d.  Any expression sign in the historical district or urban redevelopment plan area with an area of the sign larger than ten square feet shall require a sign permit and shall be subject to the regulations of this article. 
                  (14)  Home occupation signs. A professional or business nameplate which designates a legally operating home occupation. 
                  (Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. IV, § 3) 
                  Sec. 105-74. - Design and location standards. 
                  All regulated signs must comply with the following design standards: 
                  (1)  Size requirements. The total area of all permanent signs, including, but not limited to, freestanding signs, window signs, wall signs, projecting signs, and hanging signs, shall not exceed 50 square feet per business. There shall be no more than one primary, and one secondary sign per business. A secondary sign is one that is smaller than the primary sign. 
                  (2)  Area of sign. The area within a continuous perimeter enclosing the limits of writing, representation, emblem, or any figure of similar character together with any frame, other material, open space, or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate such writing, representation, emblem or any figure of similar character from the background against which it is placed. For double-faced signs, both sides shall be measured and added together and divided by two in computing the sign area. 
                  (3)  Signage plans. Buildings or clusters of buildings having more than one tenant or use shall provide a signage plan for the entire structure or project to be reviewed and approved by the director of planning and zoning prior to erection of any sign. The signage plan must be designed so that it establishes a common theme or design, uses similar construction methods, and has compatible colors, lettering, lettering style, symbols, scale and size of signs, and/or identical background. Signage plans for office buildings must have their primary focus on the identification of the building, and individual tenants may be identified by using small lettering on a window or door or directories. Total signage area within the plan is subject to the maximum size limitation of this article. Signage area cannot be transferred to a single building or facade from other buildings in the project. 
                  (4)  Sign materials. Exposed surfaces of signs may be constructed of metal, glass, stone, concrete, brick, cloth, or wood. 
                  (5)  Color. Signs must be finished in subdued earthtone colors. Earthtones may be defined in this context to include the full spectrum of soil and clay colors. Spectrums of off-whites to deep browns and light grays to black provide a wide range of acceptable colors. Brighter colors may be used, provided they are imbued with brown or black tones. For example, pink imbued with brown would tend toward mauve and would be acceptable. Bright reds imbued with brown or black tones give a deeper burgundy or maroon color and may also be acceptable. Colors should complement the color scheme of the building. In no case will "day-glo," fluorescent, reflective colored materials that give the appearance of changing color, or brilliant luminescent colors be permitted. 
                  (6)  Illumination. 
                  a.  Externally illuminated signs. Light fixtures for externally illuminated signs must be simple in form and mounted so they do not obscure building ornamentation. The light fixtures should emphasize the continuity of the building surface and should not clutter the building in an unorganized manner. Spot lights and floodlights shall be directed only at the sign surface. Light shall not be directed off the property. No exposed light sources are allowed, and all light sources must be shaded to contain light rays to the sign. Colored lighting is prohibited. 
                  b.  Internally illuminated signs. This type of sign is not considered appropriate in the historical district and is prohibited. 
                  (7)  Type styles. Only type styles in use in the United States between 1830 and 1910 may be accepted in the historical district. 
                  (8)  Location on building. Architectural details of a building often suggest a location, size, or shape for a sign. Signage should complement the architectural details of the building. Signs should help to establish a visual continuity with adjacent store fronts and relate directly to the store entrance. Signs must be oriented toward pedestrians or vehicles in close proximity. Signs shall be designed and located on the building or on the premises in a manner that is compatible with the mass and scale of the building to which the sign applies. Signs must not obscure architectural details of the building nor cover doors, windows, or other integral elements of the facade. Signs shall not obstruct views of nearby intersection and driveways. 
                  (9)  Projection and clearance. No sign may project more than 36 inches from the face of a building or pole. Projecting and hanging signs must maintain at least eight feet of clearance from ground level. Signs may extend over city property only with the written approval of the city council. 
                  (Ord. of 10-4-2010, Art. IV, § 4; Ord. of 6-16-2014; Ord. of 9-8-2014) 
                  Sec. 105-75. - Types of signs prohibited. 
                  In addition to those signs prohibited in section 105-45, the following types of signs are prohibited in the historical district and the urban redevelopment plan area: 
                  (1)  Electronic message signs. A permanent, freestanding roof, wall, or other sign which changes copy electronically using switches and electric lamps. Automatic changing signs, such as public service and time, temperature, and date signage are prohibited. 
                  (2)  Off-premises freestanding signs and billboards. A permanent outdoor sign which directs attention to a building, profession, product, service, industry, entertainment, or other activity not conducted, sold, or offered on the premises upon which the sign is located or to which it is affixed. 
                  (3)  Roof signs. Any signs erected partly or wholly on or over the roof of a building, including ground signs that rest on or overlap a roof. Signs mounted anywhere on a mansard roof are not allowed. 
                  (4)  Animated signs. A rotating or revolving sign or signs where all or a portion of the signs moves in some manner. 
                  (5)  Wind signs. Any propeller, whirling, or similar device which is designed to flutter, rotate, or display other movement under the influence of the wind. This shall include "gasoline flags" or banners. 
                  (6)  Video signs. Animated visual messages which are projected on screen. 
                  (7)  Illuminated awnings. Illuminated (backlit), translucent, awnings are not considered appropriate and are prohibited. 
                  (8)  Inflatable signs or displays. Any inflatable object used for signage or promotional purposes. 
                  (9)  Neon signs. Neon used to draw attention to a business or building in any manner, including, but not limited to, neon text, logos, or outlining of a building's architectural features, is not considered appropriate in the historical district and is therefore prohibited. Neon may be used as an accent to signage in the urban redevelopment plan area, such as an "open" sign done in neon, but may not be the primary signage for a building.

                  Sec. 106-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions . Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 106-4(b) and (c) of this chapter. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in section 106-4 (b) and (c) of this chapter shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f) of the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land- disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of code section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 106-4(b)(2) of this Code. 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with O.C.G.A. 12-5, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to code section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to code section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this chapter and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a minor buffer impact as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 106-4 of this chapter.

                  Sec. 106-5. - Application and permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the planning and zoning department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city planning and zoning department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 106-5(c) of this chapter. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 106-4(b) and (c) of this chapter will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by a minimum of 3 copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  Fees shall be charged in accordance with the city fee schedule set forth in section 2-110. 
                  (4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-17(9), or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 106-4(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 106-5(b)(7), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the plan submittal. 
                  (6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 106-4, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
                  2.  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by section 106-4(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 106-5(b)(7) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 106-6. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The city planning and zoning department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The city planning and zoning department or designee shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to code section 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7 (e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Sec. 107-1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This ordinance seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as reducing impervious cover and the preservation of greenspace and other natural areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  Sec. 107-2. - Applicability. 
                  (a)  This chapter shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (b) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
                  (1)  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
                  (2)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
                  (3)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the planning and zoning administrator to be a hotspot land use; or 
                  (4)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items subsections (1) and (2) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  (b)  The following activities are exempt from this chapter: 
                  (1)  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
                  (2)  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
                  (3)  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; 
                  (4)  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the planning and zoning administrator;

                  ARTICLE IV. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 

                  Sec. 107-91. - Generally. 
                  All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the volume of stormwater runoff generated. These practices should seek to use pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. 
                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter. 
                  (Ord. of 2-6-2006, § 4) 
                  Sec. 107-92. - Water quality. 
                  All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. Stormwater practices must treat the first one and two-tenths inches of runoff from all storms and remove 80 percent of the post-development total suspended solid load from treated runoff. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  (1)  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
                  (2)  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
                  (3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (Ord. of 2-6-2006, § 4.1) 
                  Sec. 107-93. - Stream channel protection. 
                  Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  (1)  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of any stream buffers protected through other regulations; and 
                  (2)  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control; and 
                  (3)  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. Provided, however, that the local government may reduce the storage volume calculated to meet this requirement by: (1) the volume that is infiltrated and/or evapotranspired through use of other structural and nonstructural stormwater management measures; and (2) the reduction in volume that occurs through use of nonstructural stormwater management measures and better site design. If the entire storage volume calculated to meet the requirement of 24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event is eliminated, infiltrated, and/or evapotranspired, the local government may waive this requirement.

                  Sec. 107-94. - Overbank flooding protection. 
                  Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under section 107-93 is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  (Ord. of 2-6-2006, § 4.3) 
                  Sec. 107-95. - Extreme flooding protection. 
                  Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  (Ord. of 2-6-2006, § 4.4) 
                  Sec. 107-96. - Structural stormwater controls. 
                  All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control.

                  Sec. 107-97. - Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. 
                  The use of better site design and nonstructural stormwater management practices is encouraged to minimize reliance on structural stormwater management measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 107-92 and the stream channel protection volume required under section 107-93(3). The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality and channel protection volume requirements. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.

                  Sec. 402. - Official zoning map. 
                  The location and boundaries of the above listed districts are hereby established as shown on a map entitled official zoning map of the city. Said map, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance.

                  If in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance and the applicable laws of the state, changes are made in boundaries or other matter portrayed on the official zoning map, such changes shall be entered on the official zoning map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the city council, with appropriate entry or indication of such amendment on the official zoning map. No amendment to this ordinance which involves matter portrayed on the official zoning map shall become effective until after such change and entry has been made on said map. 
                  No changes of any nature shall be made in the official zoning map or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this ordinance. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or persons shall be considered a violation of this ordinance. Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning map which may from time to time be made or published, the official zoning map shall be maintained by the city clerk, shall be located at City Hall and shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the city. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 403. - Replacement of official zoning map. 
                  In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the city council may adopt a new official zoning map which shall supersede the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original official zoning map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the city clerk, and bear the seal of the city or a notary public under the following words: "This is to certify that this official zoning map supersedes and replaces the official zoning map adopted (insert last adoption date) as part of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Dawsonville, Georgia." 
                  Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost, or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.

                  Sec. 404. - Interpretation of district boundaries. 
                  1.  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline of streets or highways, street right-of-way lines or railroad right-of-way lines or such lines extended, such centerline, street right-of-way lines, or railroad right-of-way lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  2.  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the corporate limit line of the city, such corporate limit line shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  3.  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following property lines or such lines extended, such property lines or such lines extended, as indicated by boundary survey, deed or legal description maintained in the official file of said zoning adoption or amendment, if available, shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  4.  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline of streambeds or riverbeds, such centerline shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  5.  In the case where the exact location of a boundary cannot be determined by the foregoing methods, the planning commission shall, upon application, determine the location of the boundary. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 405. - Boundary line divides a lot of single ownership. 
                  Where a boundary line as appearing on the official zoning map divides a lot in single ownership at the time of the enactment of these regulations, the requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lies may be extended to the balance of the lot without recourse or amendment procedure, provided that this provision shall not apply to a double frontage lot. In the case of a double frontage lot, the restrictions of the district applying to the adjoining lots which front on the same street as the lot frontage in question shall apply.

                  ARTICLE V. - NONCONFORMING LOTS, BUILDINGS, AND USES 

                  Sec. 501. - Nonconforming purpose and intent. 
                  Within the districts established by this ordinance, there exist certain incompatible lots, buildings, structures, signs and uses of land which were lawful before these regulations were adopted but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of these regulations or future amendments. It is the intention of this article to permit these nonconformities to continue, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of these regulations that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for variances or for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 502. - Continuance of nonconforming use. 
                  The lawful use of any building, structure, sign, or land existing at the time of enactment of these regulations may be continued, subject to the limitations of section 503, even though such use does not conform with the provisions of these regulations, except that the use of a principal building, structure or land containing a nonconforming use shall not be: 
                  1.  Changed to another nonconforming use; 
                  2.  Reestablished after discontinuance or abandonment for six months; 
                  3.  Expanded, enlarged or extended, unless such use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such use is located; 
                  4.  Rebuilt, altered or repaired after damage exceeding 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction as determined by the planning director or designee, and provided such rebuilding, alteration or repair is completed within one year of such damage; 
                  5.  Moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot occupied by such use, except in conformity with these regulations. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any building, structure, or portion thereof, declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety or health, upon order of such official. Changes in ownership or tenancy of a nonconforming use are permitted. 
                  6.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the nonconforming use is a manufactured house and the owner desires to replace the manufactured home, the replacement shall comply with all requirements of R3R or RMM and all current development regulations. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 503. - Expansion of nonconforming buildings. 
                  A nonconforming building which contains a conforming use may be expanded, enlarged or extended, provided that any such additions meet the applicable yard and building setbacks, buffer and landscape strip requirements and all other regulations for the district in which it is located. This section shall not, however, be construed as to authorize the expansion of a nonconforming building for a use which is not permitted by the regulations for the district within which such building is located. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 504. - Buildings under construction. 
                  Nothing in this article shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the adoption of this zoning ordinance. However, all such construction must be completed within one year of the adoption of this zoning ordinance and if not, then the nonconforming use shall be deemed abandoned and the plans, construction and designated use must comply with this zoning ordinance.

                  ARTICLE VI. - OFF-STREET PARKING, LOADING AND ACCESS REQUIREMENTS 

                  Sec. 601. - Off-street parking and loading spaces required. 
                  Off-street auto parking and loading spaces shall be provided, as specified in this article, for uses and structures hereafter established in all districts at the time of initial construction of any principal building, unless otherwise exempted from this article. For developments phased in timing, parking and loading requirements may also be phased in accordance with the requirements applying for each particular time phase of development. Any building or use that is subsequently enlarged or converted to another use shall meet the off-street parking and loading space requirements of this article, for the enlarged or new use. Required parking and loading spaces shall be maintained and shall not be encroached upon by refuse containers, signs, or other structures, unless an equal number of spaces are provided elsewhere in conformance with these regulations. Required parking and loading spaces shall be provided with vehicular access to a public street or alley, unless such access is prohibited by these regulations. Off-street parking and loading facilities required shall be located on the same lot as the principal building or use. However, as much as 50 percent of the required number of parking spaces may be located within 400 feet of the principal building or use, provided proof of ownership or a valid lease agreement for use of such premises is provided to the planning director or designee. Such distance shall be measured between the nearest point of the parking facility and the nearest point of the principal building or use. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 602. - Minimum number of off-street parking spaces required. 
                  The minimum number of required off-street parking spaces for each type of permitted use shall be as indicated below. For uses not specifically listed, the off-street parking requirements shall be those of the most similar use as determined by the planning director or designee. The planning director or designee may also reference the latest American Planning Associations Parking Standards Report. When referencing APA reports weight should be given to the jurisdiction listed with a population density closest to that of the city. When the application of these parking requirements results in a fractional space requirement, the fractional space requirement shall be construed to mean one additional space.

                  a.  Where the land must be cleared and graded as required by the application of laws to prevent soil erosion or sedimentation; 
                  b.  Where regulations for storm drainage improvements require alteration of the topography; 
                  c.  Where necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin natural growth that has become so dense as to prohibit normal growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen, or dangerous or decayed growth; 
                  d.  Where access and/or utility crossings have been approved. 
                  3.  Vegetation, except for ground covers, shall be of such type as to be a height of not less than three feet when planted and which will, in normal growth, attain a height of six feet within three years; provided, however that such plant materials can form a hardy screen, dense enough and high enough both to interrupt vision and to reduce the transmission of sound.

                  Sec. 804. - Landscape strip required. 
                  All properties except those containing single-family detached or attached residences and two-family residences shall provide a landscape strip, as defined by these regulations, of ten feet in width along the developed portion abutting any public street or right-of-way and five feet in width along the developed portion of side property lines. A five-foot wide landscape strip along a side property line may be relocated if required to share a common access drive along said side property line. 
                  It shall be the responsibility of the property owner of a lot to be used or built upon to install and maintain the required landscape strips. Installation of landscape strips may be phased in accordance with approved building plans.

                  Sec. 805. - Acceptable plant materials. 
                  In those instances where the natural vegetation and topography are insufficient to achieve the desired level of screening required by these regulations, a planted buffer shall be provided and shall consist of plant material of such growth characteristics as will provide an acoustical and visual screen. Planted materials shall conform to the following specifications: 
                  1.  Trees used for screening purposes should be native to the region and shall not be deciduous. Trees should be at least three feet in height above the ground when planted or which will, in normal growth, attain a height of six feet within three years. 
                  2.  Shrubs that are used to form hedges shall not be deciduous. Shrubs shall be a least three feet above the ground level when planted. They should be spaced in such a way that, when mature, they will form a continuous visual screen (hedge) that is at least six feet in height.

                  Sec. 806. - Maintenance of buffers and landscape strips. 
                  The owner and/or user of the property shall be responsible for installing the trees and shrubs and maintaining them in a neat and orderly appearance. This includes irrigating or watering, fertilizing, pruning and replanting where necessary. In cases of noncompliance, the planning director or designee shall be empowered to take action as provided by law to ensure maintenance of all plant and landscaping materials.

                  No more than 75 percent of the mature, healthy, existing trees in excess of ten inches in diameter shall be cut, damaged or destroyed; provided, however, that additional trees may be removed upon approval by the planning director or designee if one tree is planted and maintained for each one tree removed in excess of ten inches in diameter. 
                  Sec. 808. - Parking area landscaping requirements. 
                  Interior landscaping for parking areas shall be required for parking lots designed and constructed for more than five or more spaces. Such interior landscaping shall not be less than ten percent of the total area devoted to parking on the lot. 
                  In districts where permitted, all outside storage areas shall be screened from all public rights-of-ways with a 100 percent opaque, solid wooden fence or masonry wall at least six feet in height, or a densely planted landscape strip of at least ten feet in width. The insertion of plastic or metal weaving into chain link fences shall not be considered to be in compliance with the requirements of this section. Access driveways serving open storage areas shall be provided with a gate that is 100 percent opaque. In cases where the governing body approves an open storage area as a conditional use in the NB or CHB districts, the governing body may require screening in addition to the requirements of this section. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018)

                  In all zoning districts, dumpsters and trash receptacles shall be screened from view from all public rights-of-ways, either by locating said dumpsters to the rear of a building, or by erection of a 100 percent opaque, solid wooden fence or masonry wall on three sides of said dumpster. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 810. - Administration and enforcement. 
                  Where buffers are required, the applicant must demonstrate, whether on appropriate plans or after inspection by the planning director or designee, that the plant materials in place or installed achieve the required screening. All site plans, plot plans and grading and drainage plans shall indicate all required buffers and landscape strips. Required buffers, landscape strips, and parking lot landscaping shall be installed in accordance with approved plans prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. However, owing to special conditions or exceptional circumstance such as drought, said buffers and landscape strips may be installed within 90 days after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, provided that a letter of credit, escrow money, performance bond or other approved alternative is submitted to the planning director or designee prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

                  Sec. 902. - Administrative variances. 
                  The director of planning and zoning shall have the power to grant administrative variances (except for density and use) from the development standards of the zoning ordinance of the city if the intent of the ordinance can be achieved and equal performance obtained by granting a variance. 
                  A.  Authority. The authority to grant administrative variances in accord with this section shall be limited to variances from the following requirements: 
                  1.  Front yard or a yard adjacent to a public street. Variances shall not exceed ten feet; 
                  2.  Side yard. Variances shall not exceed five feet; 
                  3.  Rear yard. Variances shall not exceed ten feet; 
                  4.  Building height. A variance may be granted up to, but not exceeding, ten feet if such variance does not allow space habitable by humans and is also approved by the fire marshal and would not result in an increase in the number of stories that would otherwise be allowed by the zoning district; 
                  5.  Buffers. The dimensions of a landscaping buffer required by the zoning ordinance or other ordinance may be varied by no more than 25 percent if the adopted comprehensive plan recommends a similar or more compatible use of the neighboring property or in other situations if the intent of the required buffer can be equally achieved; however, no buffer required as a condition of zoning shall be modified; 
                  6.  Parking. If the required parking standards cannot reasonably be met and if a variance will not adversely affect the spirit or intent of the ordinance, then a variance of not more than ten percent may be granted; 
                  7.  Home occupations. If the intended use is clearly allowed pursuant to the definition of "home occupation," then an administrative variance may be granted to conduct such business. 
                  B.  Notification. The applicant may choose to either submit an affidavit attesting to notice that includes signatures of all adjoining property owners listed within the application package or the applicant may choose to permit written notice from the planning department to adjoining property owners of the variance application and then wait at least ten business days from notice to all adjoining property owners before the variance may be considered for approval. Also, notice of the variance application shall be posted upon the property ten days before the variance is considered and shall state the variance requested and the date the variance shall be considered. 
                  C.  Basis for approval. The following criteria shall be considered by the planning director before allowing an administrative variance. No variance may be granted administratively for an application for a variance that has been heard by the planning commission within one year or if the application is for the expansion of a non-conforming use or structure. 
                  1.  The variance neither interferes with the rights of others as provided in this chapter nor is injurious to the public health, safety, general welfare; 
                  2.  A strict interpretation and enforcement of the standards or requirement would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; 
                  3.  No exceptional or extraordinary circumstances applicable to the subject property exist that do not generally apply to other properties in the same district; 
                  4.  The variance provides for reasonable use under the specified circumstances of each application; 
                  5.  The variance achieves the general intent of this ordinance; 
                  6.  The variance is the minimum possible variance under the specific circumstances; and 
                  7.  The variance does not exceed the scope of the authority set forth in subsection (A) hereof. 
                  D.  Conditions of approval. The planning director may impose reasonable conditions upon any administrative variance to ensure that the public health, safety, and general welfare are protected. A violation of any imposed condition shall be a violation of this section. 
                  E.  Administration. After all requirements for a variance application in accord with the terms hereof are received, the planning and zoning department shall review and certify that all required information is complete and that the request is within the limits of consideration set forth in subsection (A) hereof. The applicant shall then be advised to proceed with public notice in accord with sub-section (B) hereof. After required notice has been provided and the time period for response has passed, the planning director shall have ten business days to render a decision. Notice of the decision shall be provided to the applicant by mailing such decision within five business days of the decision. Notice of the action taken by the planning director shall be provided to the planning commission and shall be placed as an item of old business for no further action upon the agenda of the planning commission within 31 days. 
                  F.  Compliance with other codes. The effect of an administrative variance approval shall be that a specific request is determined to be appropriate for a specific location. The administrative variance application shall not approve a site plan nor waive or modify any other requirements of any other county code other than as specifically granted pursuant to the variance. 
                  G.  Appeal. The applicant or an adjoining property owner may appeal to the mayor and council the decision of the planning director regarding an administrative variance within ten days of the decision via written objection and appeal. Any such appeal shall be heard by the mayor and council de novo in accord with the standard appeal procedure. Any appeal of the decision of the mayor and council shall be on the record by certiorari to the county superior court.

                  Sec. 904. - Creation of the Planning Commission and appointment of members. 
                  A.  The planning commission as it existed prior to the implementation of this ordinance shall be disbanded and reconstituted as set forth herein in order to provide geographic diversity of representation within the city as has been adopted for the council by the creation of district posts. Upon adoption of this ordinance the planning commission shall be composed of five members who shall be nominated by the mayor or any member of the council and elected by majority vote of the council to the slots of post 1, post 2, post 3, post 4 and at large. Four of the five members shall be appointed by the city council from the four council districts and must reside in the district that they represent. The fifth member (at large) shall be appointed by the city council from any district in the city and may reside anywhere in the city. 
                  B.  Beginning in 2019, following adoption of this ordinance, the members shall serve staggered terms with the members representing posts 1 and 2 and the at large member serving a term of three years and the members representing posts 3 and 4 serving a term of two years. Thereafter, the members of the planning commission shall be appointed for a term of three years and shall serve until their successors are appointed. The compensation of the members of the planning commission shall be as established by the governing body. Any vacancy in the membership of the planning commission shall be filled for the unexpired term of such vacancy in the same manner as the original appointment. The governing body may remove any member of the planning commission for due cause after written notice to such member and after a public hearing. Members of the planning commission shall appoint a secretary, or in lieu of such appointment, the planning director or designee or city clerk shall serve as the secretary of the planning commission. 
                  C.  A minimum of three members must be present to constitute a quorum. One such member shall be annually elected chairman of the planning commission by the planning commission members, and the chairman shall not vote except in cases of a tie-vote between the other members. In cases of a tie-vote and the chairman recuses himself from voting, then such tie-vote shall constitute denial of said motion, application or action. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 905. - Meetings and records. 
                  The planning commission shall meet at least one time each month at the call of the chairman, or at such other times as the planning commission may determine, and all such meetings shall be open to the public. The planning commission shall adopt rules for the transaction of business, or in lieu of such rules, the commission shall follow "Robert's Rules of Order," latest edition. The planning commission shall keep record of its resolutions, recommendations, transactions, findings, and determinations, and all such records shall be public record and available for purchase by interested parties at a reasonable cost. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 906. - Attendance requirement. 
                  Each planning commission member shall be required to attend at least nine of the 12 required monthly meetings of the planning commission; however, a member appointed during the middle of a calendar year shall be required to attend at least 75 percent of the meetings remaining in the year in which the member is appointed. Failure to attend the minimum number of meetings during a calendar year may constitute due cause for removal. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 907. - Variances, conditional uses and map amendments. 
                  1.  Purpose. The purpose of a variance is to provide relief when a strict application of the district requirements would impose unusual practical difficulties or unnecessary physical hardships on the applicant. Practical difficulties and unnecessary hardships may result from the size, shape, or dimensions of a site or the location of existing structures thereon; from geographic, topographic, or other conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity. No variance shall be granted to allow the use of property for a purpose not authorized within the district in which the proposed use would be located. A variance should be granted only after evidence is presented and accepted that enforcement of all of the required standards on the property in question would render the property useless. This article establishes conditions; criteria for granting variances; public hearings on proposed variances; variances to road requirements; variance procedures; compliance with conditions of approval; vested interest in approved variances; investigations and reports; revocation; limitations on re-applications; and use variance. A variance may be granted, upon specific findings that all of the following conditions exist. The absence of any one of the conditions shall be grounds for denial of the application for variance. 
                  1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same district; and, 
                  2.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of these zoning regulations would create an unnecessary hardship and would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners within the district in which the property is located; and, 
                  3.  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located; and, 
                  4.  Relief, if granted, will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or general welfare in such a manner as will interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably affect their value; and, 
                  5.  The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant; and, 
                  6.  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building, or structure; and, 
                  7.  The variance is a request to permit a use of land, building or structures which is permitted by right in the district involved. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 908. - Criteria to consider for conditional uses. 
                  Any proposed conditional use shall require an application for conditional use, a copy of the plat, and payment of a fee set by the governing body for the application and review of the proposed conditional use. 
                  Applications for conditional use permits to exceed the height limitations, applications for conditional signs, and applications for certificates of appropriateness shall also require architectural elevations of all proposed structures and buildings requested for approval. 
                  Applicants shall submit six copies of any required application, plat and architectural elevations to the planning director or designee for distribution to the applicable bodies and/or review agencies. The planning director or designee may require more or less copies depending on the nature and extent of required review. Applications which require action by the governing body shall require disclosure of any conflicts of interest as specified in the Georgia Zoning Procedures Act. 
                  The applicant, staff, planning commission and governing body should review applications for conditional uses with regard to the following criteria: 
                  1.  Off-street parking and loading facilities are adequate in terms of location, amount and design to serve the use. 
                  2.  The number, size and type of signs proposed are compatible with the surrounding area. 
                  3.  The amount and location of open space and the provision of screening is such that buffering of incompatible uses is achieved. 
                  4.  Ingress and egress to the property is suitable and safe, and the effect of the proposed activity on traffic flow along adjoining streets is not adverse. 
                  5.  The location and intensity of outdoor lighting is such that it does not cast light on adjacent, adjoining or neighboring properties. 
                  6.  Hours and manner of operation of the proposed use are not inconsistent with adjacent and nearby uses. 
                  7.  Public facilities and utilities are capable of adequately serving the proposed use. 
                  8.  The proposed use will not have a significant adverse effect on the level of property values or the general character of adjacent land uses or the general area. 
                  9.  The physical conditions of the site, including size, shape, topography and drainage, are suitable for the proposed development. 
                  10.  The proposed use is consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan of the city. 
                  The staff, planning commission and governing body may consider other factors deemed relevant before formulating recommendations and taking action on a particular conditional use application.

                  Sec. 909. - Criteria to consider for map amendments (rezonings). 
                  Any proposed amendment to the zoning map shall be submitted by application with a copy of the plat and payment of a fee set by the governing body for the application and review of the proposed amendment to the zoning map. 
                  Applicants shall submit six copies of any proposed zoning map amendment and plat to the planning director or designee for distribution to the applicable bodies and/or review agencies. The planning director or designee may require more or less copies depending on the nature and extent of required review. Applications which require action by the governing body shall require disclosure of any conflicts of interest as specified in the Georgia Zoning Procedures Act. 
                  The applicant, staff, planning commission and governing body should review an application for zoning map amendment with regard to the following criteria: 
                  1.  The existing uses and zoning of nearby property and whether the proposed zoning will adversely affect the existing use or usability of nearby property. 
                  2.  The extent to which property values are diminished by the particular zoning restrictions. 
                  3.  The extent to which the destruction of property values promotes the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public. 
                  4.  The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner. 
                  5.  The physical suitability of the subject property for development as presently zoned and under the proposed zoning district. 
                  6.  The length of time the property has been vacant, considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property, and whether there are existing or changed conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the rezoning request. 
                  7.  The zoning history of the subject property. 
                  8.  The extent to which the proposed zoning will result in a use, which will or could cause excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, schools, parks, or other public facilities. 
                  9.  Whether the zoning proposal is in conformity with the policy and intent of the comprehensive plan, land use plan, or other adopted plans. 
                  The staff, planning commission and governing body may consider other factors deemed relevant before formulating recommendations and taking action on a particular request.

                  Sec. 1001. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The restricted agricultural (RA) district is an area which remains rural in character, yet where urban growth and expansion is expected to reach in the future. The regulations of this district are intended to provide a favorable climate for both agricultural and nonagricultural development and to provide orderly, timely, economic growth, as well as to recognize current conditions. The purpose of this district is to permit low-intensity and restricted agricultural uses in those areas which remain rural in character, yet where urban growth and expansion is expected in the future as the city develops. The preferred land uses in the district are agricultural, either active in the form of crops, or passive in the form of forest management or pasture lands with limited animal density. The requirements of the district are designed to encourage the continuing low-intensity agriculture use of the property and protect active urban uses found in adjacent districts of the city.

The keeping of four or more animals shall constitute a kennel. Minimum lot size for a kennel is five acres. 
                  5.  Accessory buildings and uses customarily incidental to the principal residential and agricultural uses of the property.

                  ARTICLE XVII. - RMHT, MANUFACTURED HOUSING TEMPORARY DISTRICT (12 MONTHS) 
                  THE RMHT DISTRICT HAS BEEN DELETED. NO APPLICATIONS TO REZONE PROPERTY TO THIS DISTRICT WILL BE HEARD BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION OR THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL FROM THE ADOPTED DATE OF THIS ORDINANCE. ALL LAND AREAS CURRENTLY ZONED RMHT DISTRICT SHALL ABIDE BY THE FOLLOWING REGULATIONS. 

                  Sec. 1701. - Purpose and intent. 
                  RMHT-manufactured housing temporary district is intended for a one family residence in a manufactured home, or an accessory manufactured home where a permanent home already exists. This district is a temporary use classification, which automatically reverts to that land district which existed before this RMHT was approved after 12 months from its approval by the city council. The use of the manufactured home shall thereafter become a nonconforming use subject to the nonconforming use provision of this ordinance. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 1702. - Permitted uses. 
                  The following uses are permitted in the RMHT-manufactured housing temporary district: 
                  1.  One manufactured home as the principal dwelling on a lot with minimum area of one acre and fronting on a public street maintained by the city or state, provided that the owner and occupant of the manufactured home and the owner of the lot are the same person. 
                  2.  One manufactured home ("MH") as a second and temporary accessory dwelling upon a lot where a home exists, provided the following conditions are met: 
                  a.  The MH is an accessory use on a one-acre minimum size lot that meets all requirements of the RMHT district, provided that the occupant of the MH and the owner/occupant of the principal dwelling and lot are as closely related as father, son, mother, daughter, brother, sister, grandparents, or grandchildren; 
                  b.  A MH may be located on a lot which has been approved for RA or commercial use provided that construction of a building or residence begins within 90 days and provided that the MH is removed within 30 days of occupancy of the building that is being constructed or one year from the date of approval of the RMHT application, whichever is earlier; or, 
                  c.  The MH shall only be occupied by the individual or family proposed in the application for the RMHT district and the MH shall be removed within 90 days of the date that the occupant no longer needs residence in the MH. 
                  d.  It shall be unlawful for any person to place, store, or maintain any MH in city except: as specified under the provisions of the R3R district or the RMHT district; or within a manufactured home sales lot or similar use. 
                  e.  This ordinance specifically reserves in favor of the planning commission and city council the discretion to deny or condition, based upon the factors set forth herein, any individual application submitted hereunder if, after review of the application and careful study hereof, the proposed re-districting is deemed by the city council not to be in the best interests of the health, safety and welfare of the present and future citizens of the city.

                  ARTICLE XVIII. - RPC RESIDENTIAL PLANNED COMMUNITY 

                  Sec. 1801. - Purpose. 
                  The residential planned community district is a parcel of land developed with a variety of land uses which may vary from strict application of minimum standards in other land use classifications with the purpose of encouraging the development of large tracts of land as planned communities; encourage flexible and creative concepts in site planning; preserve the natural environment by encouraging scenic and functional open areas within residential areas; and provide for an efficient use of land resulting in increased efficiency in providing services, thus lowering development costs due to the smaller networks for streets and shorter utility lines. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 1802. - In general. 
                  The residential planned comprehensive development is a flexible alternative which advocates the grouping or clustering of lots and buildings on a smaller portion of the tract, where the developer can maintain the same residential density but offer smaller lots, with remaining land dedicated or reserved for open space, agriculture, woodlands or recreation. 
                  1.  Applicability. RPC is permitted only if a single developer or development group is planning and constructing the entire unit, including all amenities, and shall not be available to any development if any lots or parcels are sold to others before construction of amenities and buildings (excepting single family residences). Amenities may be shown as part of a specific phase(s) of the master plan and must be constructed accordingly. 
                  2.  In the event of the failure of the developer to complete any portion of the approved plan, then all requirements of subdivision regulations shall be complete before sale of any lots or issuance of building or occupancy permits. 
                  3.  The amount of permanent open space or natural space required shall be no less 30 percent of the development. An active amenity area is required. The overall net density shall be no more than one unit per acre except for multi-family applications which shall be four units per acre. 
                  In some cases, the health department may require a lower density for septic tank requirements based on soils and slope. 
                  4.  An application for zoning and any development permits shall be preceded in each case by informal meeting with the mayor or other council member, the city manager and the planning director or designee as available prior to submission and shall be consistent with the format required for subdivision approval with the following additions: 
                  a.  A proposed master plan showing at minimum: 
                  i.  Total property area included in the development with a legal description of the subject property and bounds; 
                  ii.  Proposed buildings with approximate square footage and footprints; 
                  iii.  Proposed street layout; 
                  iv.  Existing topographic conditions to include a contour interval of a minimum five feet based on field surveys or photogram metric photogrammetric methods; 
                  v.  Amenity areas and buildings, including defined open space; 
                  vi.  Traffic impact study. 
                  b.  Water and sewage disposal and other utility plans. 
                  c.  A statement of intent containing disclosure of ownership, financial information, of the character of the proposed development, including a summary of gross density, types of dwelling units, stages of the development including completion of amenities, open space and landscaping. 
                  d.  A master drainage plan shall be provided with the application for rezoning to identify the detention/retention and encourage creative water quality and quantity treatment processes. 
                  5.  Lapse of approval shall occur two years after the approval of the development plan or if the applicant fails to reasonably maintain the development schedule (delay over six months for any phase of the project without satisfactory explanation.) The planning commission may extend approval for one year at its discretion. Upon lapse of approval, all approved documents shall be revoked and the area shall be returned to the previous district classification following appropriate notice, hearings and approvals of the mayor and council. The developer shall receive a minimum of 60 days' notice of intent to revoke approval prior to initiating the application. 
                  6.  The approved rezoning to RPC shall automatically be conditioned upon the approved master plan regardless of ownership unless approval lapses pursuant to section 1802(5). Any change or revision to the master plan after the initial rezoning or any change to any other zoning condition imposed by the county, shall require a rezoning application. The approved plan and any revisions shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk with the minutes of the meeting when the plan is approved or revised. 
                  7.  Any major or substantial change in the approved master development plan that affects the intent and character of the development, increases the density or changes the land use pattern, changes the location or dimensions of streets or similar changes must be reviewed and approved by the mayor and council after review and recommendation by the planning commission before any work shall be permitted. A request for revision of the master development plan shall be supported by a written statement justifying the necessity or desirability for such revision. Any such major change shall be considered a request to change a zoning condition and shall be subject to rezoning procedures.

                  Sec. 2601. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The intent of this article is to establish and preserve a compact central business district convenient and attractive for a wide range of retail uses, business transactions, government and professional offices, places of amusement, employment activities, and services to the public designed primarily to meet the day-to-day shopping and service needs of residents of the city. 
                  It is further the intent of this article to ensure that development within the central business district is consistent or compatible with development in the, town business district. The governing body finds that, due to the proximity of the central business district (CBD) to the historic downtown square, that development within the central business district could either substantially enhance or threaten the character and economic conditions of the historic downtown square, depending upon the type, nature and architectural character of such development. Because of the potential impact development within the CBD could have on the long term economic vitality of properties within the, town business district, which such historical properties are found to be of utmost importance to tourism and the economies of the city and county, the governing body finds that all alterations to structures and development of new structures within this district shall require a review according to the guidelines of the city historic district ordinance. This is required to ensure the integrity, stability and enhancement of the town business district (see section 2605).

No change in the county zoning ordinance after an annexation shall affect or change the land use performance standards for the property annexed. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 3304. - Assignment of AP. 
                  1.  Upon the effective date of this article, the AP zoning designation shall be an option for the initial zoning of property annexed into the corporate limits of the city. 
                  a.  All persons wishing to maintain the same use of their land as well as the same intensity of the use of their land after annexation shall secure such desire by indicating on their petition for annexation that they wish their property be zoned AP upon annexation. 
                  b.  Only upon annexation is a landowner eligible to have his land classified within the AP zoning district. Once the land is assigned to a different land use district under the city's zoning ordinance as provided in section 3305 below, the AP district is no longer available. 
                  2.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require property upon annexation or any time after annexation to be assigned the AP zoning designation. Rather, the use of the AP zoning category is at the request of the zoning applicant and is conditioned upon the granting of the same by the mayor and council. 
                  3.  Once designated as AP by the mayor and council, no rezoning petition may be filed on an AP property for 12 months from the effective date of the annexation as determined by chapter 36 of title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. The foregoing notwithstanding, property shall not remain within the AP zoning district for any longer than is described in section 3305 below. 
                  (Ord. of 12-3-2018) 
                  Sec. 3305. - Conversion to city created performance standards. 
                  1.  The AP zoning designation is intended to be a temporary land use district for those persons who desire to have their land annexed into the corporate limits of the city, without changing the use of their land or the intensity of the use of their land. It is not intended to permanently supplant the specific zoning designations of the city zoning ordinance, but instead, to provide for continuity in land use performance standards upon annexation. 
                  2.  The AP zoning designation may be applied to land annexed into the corporate limits of the city for a period of up to 16 months after the effective date of the annexation as determined by chapter 36 of title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  a.  At any time at least 12 months after the effective date of annexation of the property into the corporate limits of the city, the property may be rezoned pursuant to the application of the landowner or on the initiation of a rezoning by the governing authority. 
                  b.  If no rezoning is accomplished by the end of the 16-month period referred to above, the land shall automatically be converted from AP zoning designation to the R1 zoning designation under the city zoning ordinance. 
                  c.  For good cause shown, the mayor and council of the city may extend the use of the AP zoning designation on a piece of property for longer than the 16-month period, but in no event shall the AP zoning designation be applied to a parcel in the corporate limits of the city for longer than 18 months. 
                  3.  Persons who support the application will be asked to comment first. The petitioner may, upon recognition and upon s name and address, present and explain his application. The petitioner or his designated agent shall be required to attend public hearing unless written notice of hardship is received prior to such meeting. Failure of the petitioner or agent to public hearing or meeting, except in cases of hardship, may be due cause for dismissal of such application. A time limit be imposed at the discretion of the chairman/mayor, but in no event shall such time limitation provide for less than ten minutes nor shall it be any less than the time allowed for those persons speaking in opposition to the application. 
                  4.  Persons who oppose the application will be asked to comment next. All interested parties after being recognized shall be afforded an opportunity to address the proposed application by standing before the appropriate body and identifying their name, address and interest along with any comments on the proposed application. A time limitation may be imposed at the discretion of the chairman/mayor, but in no event shall such time limitation provide for less than ten minutes, nor shall it be any less than the time allowed for those persons speaking in favor of the application.
