         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   The Stockbridge Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1991, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender and Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
                  Beginning with Supplement 24 Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
                  During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of R.G. Kelley, Merle Manders, Ted Strickland, A.J. Welch, Jr., and Laurel Henderson. 
                  The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
                  In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 24, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
                  A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
                  This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 19-482, passed March 11, 2019. 
                  Municipal Code Corporation  1700 Capital Circle SW  Tallahassee, FL 32310  800-262-2633 
                  HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
                  This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
                  Numbering System. 
                  The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title , then chapter , and ending with section . Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
                  Title. 
                  A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
                  Chapter. 
                  Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
                  Section. 
                  Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
                  Tables of Contents. 
                  There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
                  Ordinance History Note. 
                  At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
                  Beginning with Supplement No. 24 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
                  Statutory References. 
                  The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
                  Cross-Reference Table. 
                  When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
                  As of Supplement No. 24, this table will no longer be updated. 
                  Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
                  To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
                  Beginning with Supplement No. 24 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
                  Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
                  Beginning with Supplement No. 24, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  Index. 
                  If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
                  BUSINESS LICENSE 
                  See also BUSINESS TAX  Fee 5.04.030  Required when 5.04.010 
                  The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
                  Insertion Guide. 
                  Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
                  Page Numbers. 
                  When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
                  Electronic Submission. 
                  In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com . 
                  For hard copy, send two copies of all ordinances passed to: 
                  Municipal Code Corporation  P.O. Box 2235  Tallahassee, FL 32316 
                  Customer Service.

                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code and are considered "Omitted." 
                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

The city council shall have the power to accept, with or without amendments, or reject the proposed program and proposed means of financing. The city council shall not authorize an expenditure for the construction of any building, structure, work, or improvement, unless the appropriations for such project are included in the capital improvements budget, except to meet a public emergency as provided in Section 3.17 of this charter. 
                  (b)  After the conducting of a public hearing, the city council shall adopt by ordinance the final capital improvements budget for the ensuing fiscal year not later than December 31 of each year.

Any such amendments to the capital improvements budget shall become effective only upon adoption by majority vote of the city council.

                  (c)  Whenever in opening, extending, or widening any street, avenue, alley, or public place of the city a small parcel or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the city, the city council may authorize the mayor to execute and deliver in the name of the city a deed conveying said cut-off or separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining property owner or owners in exchanges for rights-of-way of said street, avenue, alley, or public place when such exchange is deemed to be in the best interest of the city.

                  C.  Manufacture, distribution, dispensation, sale, use or possession of alcoholic beverages is prohibited during working hours or at any time on city property. 
                  D.  Additionally, no employee may operate a commercial motor vehicle while in possession of an unlawful controlled substance or alcohol, unless that alcohol or unlawful controlled substance is manifested and transported as a shipment. No employee may use alcohol or an unlawful controlled substance while driving or otherwise performing a safety-sensitive job function. No employee may operate a commercial motor vehicle or perform any other safety-sensitive task within four (4) hours of using alcohol, even if the alcohol was used during off-duty time and off of city property. 
                  E.  If an employee has an accident while operating a commercial motor vehicle, the employee may not use alcohol for eight (8) hours after the accident or until the employee undergoes an alcohol test administered under this policy, whichever comes first.

As to weight, a covered vehicle is: (1) a tractor trailer or similar vehicle with a gross combination weight rating of twenty-six thousand one (26,001) pounds or more (inclusive of a towed unit with a gross vehicle weight rating of at least ten thousand (10,000) pounds) or (2) a single vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of twenty-six thousand one (26,001) pounds or more. As to cargo, a covered vehicle is one of any weight which (1) is designed to transport sixteen (16) or more, including the driver, or (2) transports hazardous materials (as defined in 49 CFR Part 172, subpart F). 
                  2.  Employees holding a commercial driver's license and employed in a position whose duties include operating any of the vehicles described above, or applicants for such positions, are covered by this policy. Covered employees and applicants (hereinafter referred to as "drivers") are subject to alcohol and drug testing as discussed below. 
                  B.  Situations in Which Drug and Alcohol Testing Will Occur. Generally, drivers are not subject to alcohol or drug testing except in conjunction with certain on-duty job functions, i.e., just before, just after, or during the performance of "safety-sensitive" job duties as defined in 49 CFR § 395.2. Such duties include, but are not limited to: (1) time spent at the driving controls of a covered vehicle, (2) on-duty time waiting to be dispatched, (3) time spent inspecting, servicing, repairing or conditioning a covered vehicle, (4) nondriving time spent on or attending a covered vehicle (except time spent resting in a sleeper berth), or (5) time spent loading or unloading, (or supervising or assisting the loading or unloading) of a covered vehicle. Such "safety-sensitive" duties are hereinafter referred to in this policy simply as driving duties. A driver must submit to an alcohol and/or drug test when indicated by this policy. Particular circumstances which will trigger a drug or alcohol test in conjunction with driving duties are as follows: 
                  1.  Testing on Reasonable Cause. A driver shall submit to a drug or alcohol test whenever the city has reasonable cause to believe that the driver is using a prohibited drug (as identified in subsection F of this section) or alcohol. The city's decision to test a driver for reasonable cause shall be based on the actions, appearance, speech, body odors or conduct of an on-duty driver which indicate the possible use of a prohibited drug or alcohol. The actions, appearance, speech, body odors or conduct of the driver indicating possible drug or alcohol use must be witnessed by at least one supervisor who has received DOT-approved training in the detection of probable drug or alcohol use. The supervisor(s) who witness conditions warranting a drug test shall prepare and sign a statement describing the driver's conduct within twenty-four (24) hours of the observed behavior or before the results of the test are released, whichever is earlier. Third-party reports that an employee is impaired in his or her driving duties due to the use of prohibited drugs or alcohol shall not constitute reasonable cause, but may be cause for the observation of the employee by his or her supervisor(s). The city will provide transportation to the testing site for employees who will be tested for reasonable cause. If an alcohol test cannot be performed within two (2) hours following a determination of reasonable cause to conduct such test, the supervisor shall prepare a written statement why the test was not administered. If an alcohol test is not performed within eight (8) hours of a determination of reasonable cause to conduct such test, the test shall not be performed and the supervisor shall prepare a written statement why the test was not performed. 
                  2.  Pre-Employment and Pre-Transfer Testing. In no case will a driver be allowed to assume first-time driving duties before the driver is tested for drugs. All applicants whom the city intends to hire for a driver position and all current employees whom the city intends to transfer into a driver position shall submit to a drug test as a prequalification condition. Such applicants and current employees shall be notified before a urine specimen is collected for testing that the specimen will be screened for evidence of drug use. A failure to pass the drug test or a refusal to submit to the drug test will result in the city's refusal to hire the applicant or transfer the employee. In certain instances, no pre-employment or pre-transfer drug test will be required of a driver who has participated in a DOT-qualified drug testing program within the previous thirty (30) days if either of the following is also true: (a) the driver passed a drug test administered within the six (6) months prior to the driver's application date, or (b) the driver was subject to random testing for the twelve (12) months prior to the driver's application date. If a pre-employment or pre-transfer test is not performed pursuant to this provision, the procedures set forth in 49 CFR § 382.301(d) will be followed prior to the performance of any driving duties. 
                  3.  Post-Accident Testing. A driver who is involved in an accident involving loss of human life or who receives a citation for a moving traffic violation in connection with the accident shall submit to a drug and alcohol test as soon as possible after the accident. No drug test will be administered later than thirty-two (32) hours after the accident. No alcohol test will be administered later than eight (8) hours after the accident. Whenever a test cannot be administered within these time limits, the driver's supervisor shall prepare a written statement of the reasons that the test was not timely administered. Whenever an alcohol test is not administered within two (2) hours after the accident, the employee's supervisor shall prepare a written statement of the reasons that the test was not promptly administered. A driver who is unable to submit to testing at the time of the accident because of serious injuries received in the accident shall provide to the city the necessary authorization for obtaining hospital reports or other documents that would indicate the presence of any controlled substances or alcohol in the driver's system. 
                  4.  Random Testing. Drivers shall be subject to random selection process whereby drivers will be selected and requested to be tested for use of controlled substances and alcohol. The selection method shall be scientifically valid and give each driver an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. Under this program at least fifty percent (50%) of the city's drivers will be subject to drug testing each calendar year, and at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the city's drivers will be subject to alcohol testing each calendar year. 
                  5.  Return-to-Duty and Follow-up Testing. A driver who is not discharged or permanently relieved of driving duties following a violation of this policy as it concerns alcohol may not resume driving duties without first passing an alcohol test. A driver who is not discharged or permanently relieved of driving duties following a violation of this policy as it concerns controlled substances may not resume driving duties without first passing a controlled substances test. A driver who has completed drug rehabilitation or a recommended course of treatment for alcohol abuse under this policy shall, on resumption of driving duties, be subject to unannounced testing. Such testing shall be conducted over a period of twelve (12) to sixty (60) months and shall include at least six (6) unannounced tests during the first twelve (12) months of his/her return to duty. The type, frequency and timing of such testing shall be at the direction of the city's substance abuse professional, who may terminate the testing at any point after the first six (6) tests under this provision. Each such unannounced alcohol test shall be administered either just before the driver is to perform driving duties or just after the driver has finished performing driving duties. 
                  C.  General Fitness for Duty Requirements. 
                  1.  These general fitness for duty procedures are designed to apply even in situations in which no reasonable cause drug or alcohol test can be administered under this policy. 
                  2.  An employee either reporting to work visibly impaired or observed to be visibly impaired while on duty will be deemed unable to perform required duties and will not be allowed to work. If possible, the employee's supervisor will seek another supervisor's opinion to confirm the employee's impaired status. If, in the opinion of the employee's supervisor, the employee is impaired, the employee may be sent home or to a medical facility by a safe means of transportation (after any reasonable cause drug or alcohol testing required by other parts of this policy). The employee may be accompanied by the supervisor or another employee if necessary. Under no circumstances will an apparently impaired employee be allowed to drive a car or other vehicle. 
                  3.  If a drug or alcohol test cannot be administered under this policy, the apparently impaired driver shall nonetheless remain ineligible to perform any driving duties for at least twenty-four (24) hours. 
                  4.  If an employee, during work, must use prescribed drugs that have the potential to impair work performance or physical or mental abilities or if an employee will be under the influence of such prescribed drugs during work, the employee must report these facts to management and present appropriate medical documentation. A decision will then be made as to whether the employee should be able to perform his/her job safely and properly. 
                  D.  Discipline for Violations of the Policy. 
                  1.  Employees will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, for any violation of this policy. 
                  2.  Additionally, employees found to have violated any part of this policy shall be immediately disqualified from further driving duties, including any situation in which a driver refuses to submit to a required drug or alcohol test or fails to pass a drug or alcohol test. A driver who does not remain readily available for testing following a covered accident may be deemed by the city to have refused to take a drug or alcohol test. Refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test includes: (a) the failure to provide an adequate breath or urine specimen absent a valid medical justification; (b) the intentional refusal to submit to the testing procedure; or (c) the engaging in any conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process. Drivers currently holding a position subject to drug testing who become disqualified from employment because of a refusal to submit to a required drug test or a failure to pass a required drug test shall be subject to discipline up to and including discharge. 
                  3.  A driver who has refused to submit to a required drug test or failed to pass a drug test shall be eligible to resume driving only after the driver completes an approved drug rehabilitation program. A driver who has refused to submit to a required alcohol test or failed to pass an alcohol test shall be eligible to resume driving duties only after the driver completes any course of treatment recommended by the city's designated substance abuse professional. 
                  E.  Condition of Employment. Compliance with this policy is a condition of employment. The failure or refusal of an applicant or employee to cooperate fully by submitting to any test or any procedure under this policy or by signing any consent form or other documents required by the testing laboratory shall be grounds for refusal to hire or termination. 
                  F.  Drug Testing Procedure. The laboratory performing drug testing for the city under the terms of this policy shall be certified by the Department of Health and Human Services under the procedures prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR Part 40. The mayor shall designate the laboratory for performing drug tests pursuant to this policy. Drug testing of covered employees shall conform to the following procedures: 
                  1.  Drug tests shall be performed on urine specimens collected in accordance with procedures and standards prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR §§ 40.23 and 40.25. 
                  2.  All analysis of drug tests performed pursuant to this policy shall meet the standards prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR § 40.29. Urine specimens shall be tested only for evidence of use of the following prohibited drugs: marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine (PCP). 
                  3.  Urine specimens shall be collected at a designated collection site by a "collection station person" (CSP). A collection site will be any suitable location at which a specimen of urine can be collected under the required conditions for privacy, security and temporary storage of the specimens. The collection site will have at least an enclosure for private urination, a toilet, some surface for writing, and a source of water for washing hands which, if practical, will be located outside of the privacy enclosure. The collection site under this policy shall be designated by the mayor. 
                  4.  During specimen collection, the CSP will restrict access to the collection site. If the CSP is not a medical professional or if the driver has less than complete privacy, the CSP shall be of the same gender as the driver. Once the driver has completed giving the specimen, no person other than the CSP shall be permitted to handle the specimen until it is secured for transport. The CSP shall not observe the collection of urine except when there is reason to believe that the driver may alter or substitute the specimen. If the CSP has reason to believe the driver has tampered with a sample, another sample shall be drawn under same gender observation. The CSP will use a standardized custody and control form to ensure that the chain-of-custody is maintained over a sample from the time it is received from the driver to the time of the analysis of contents to the ultimate return of results to the medical review officer. The CSP will also use a tamperproof seal system that prevents undetected opening of the specimen bottle and that identifies the sample with a number also appearing on the custody and control form. The CSP will also use a tamperproof shipping container which may be sealed and which allows the paperwork to be attached. 
                  5.  Each urine specimen collected will be subdivided into two (2) bottles labeled as a "primary" and a "split" specimen. Only the primary specimen will be opened and used for urinalysis. The split specimen bottle will remain sealed and will be stored at the laboratory. If analysis of the primary specimen confirms the presence of an illegal, controlled substance, the driver will have seventy-two (72) hours from the time of notification by the medical review officer to request that the split specimen be sent to another certified laboratory for a second analysis. A request for analysis of the split specimen will not stay any city actions or procedures otherwise required by this policy. 
                  6.  Urine samples shall be analyzed using both a screen test and a confirmatory test. If the screen test result is negative, the laboratory will report the result of the test as negative. If a positive result for one or more controlled substances is obtained through a screening test, then a confirmatory test shall be performed for each identified drug. Only if the confirmatory test result is again positive will the laboratory report a positive result to the medical review officer. 
                  7.  The refusal of an applicant or employee to submit to a drug test or the failure to pass a drug test required by this policy shall be cause for the refusal to hire an applicant into a driver position and shall be cause for disqualification from all driving duties, as well as cause for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. 
                  G.  Drug Reporting Procedures. The medical review officer (MRO), to be designated by the mayor, shall receive, review, report and file drug test information transmitted by the testing laboratory. The MRO is a licensed physician who has knowledge of substance abuse disorders and who has appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate drug test results. 
                  1.  The testing laboratory shall report test results only to the designated MRO. Test results shall not be transmitted verbally by telephone to the MRO. The testing laboratory and the MRO shall ensure the confidentiality of the transmitted information and shall limit access to any data transmission, storage and retrieval system to ensure the security of the data transmission. 
                  2.  The MRO shall review drug test results in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR § 40.33 and by the Federal Highway Administration in 49 CFR § 391.97. 
                  3.  If the MRO determines that there is no legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed, positive drug-test result other than the unauthorized use of a prohibited drug, the MRO shall notify management of his/her conclusions for further proceedings in accordance with this policy. 
                  H.  Alcohol Testing Procedures. Alcohol tests shall be conducted using a breathalyzer approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). A "Breath Alcohol Technician" (BAT) who is trained in DOT testing procedures shall administer all alcohol breath tests under this policy. 
                  1.  The breath test shall be conducted in a place that offers visual and aural privacy to the driver. All necessary equipment shall be provided at the testing location, which shall be secured from unauthorized entry. 
                  2.  Prior to the test, the BAT will require the driver to provide positive identification. The BAT will explain the testing procedure to the driver before administering any test. 
                  3.  A breath test shall consist of a screening test and a confirmatory test. The screening test will be conducted by first opening an individually sealed mouthpiece in view of the driver and attaching it to the testing device. The BAT will then instruct the employee to blow into the mouthpiece for a minimum of six (6) seconds or until the device indicates that an adequate amount of breath has been obtained. The driver must then be shown the result shown on the device and the result recorded. If the screen test reveals a blood alcohol level below .02, no further testing is required and the test result is considered negative. If, however, the screen test result is .02 or greater, the BAT must perform a confirmatory test. 
                  4.  The BAT shall not conduct a confirmatory test until the expiration of a waiting period of not less than fifteen (15) minutes nor more than twenty (20) minutes from the initial test. A new mouthpiece shall be used. The confirmatory test shall be conducted using a testing device that prints out or otherwise provides a hard copy of the test results, the date and time, a sequential test number, and the name and serial number of the testing device. Whenever the results of the screen test and confirmatory test are not identical, the confirmatory test shall be deemed the final test result. A blood alcohol level of .04 or greater on the final test shall constitute a positive alcohol test result. 
                  5.  The refusal of an employee to submit to an alcohol test or the failure to pass an alcohol test required by this policy shall be cause for disqualification from all driving duties, as well as cause for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Drivers who have a blood alcohol level of .02 or greater but less than .04 when tested just before, during or just after performing any driving duties, are ineligible to return to duty for at least twenty-four (24) hours or until another breath test is administered for which the result is less than .02. 
                  6.  Employees who violate this policy as to alcohol will be referred to a substance abuse professional for evaluation. The employee shall comply with any recommended treatment as a precondition to resuming driving duties. 
                  7.  The collection site under this policy shall be designated by the mayor.

                  2.26.050 - Recordkeeping. 
                  The city shall maintain those records required by 49 CFR §§ 199.23, 382.401 and 391.87. 
                  (Ord. 96-2 § 5, 1996) 
                  2.26.060 - Training program. 
                  A.  The city shall provide materials concerning the effects of alcohol and use of controlled substances of an individual's health, work and personal life; signs and symptoms of an alcohol or a controlled substances problem (the driver's or a coworker's) and available methods of intervening when an alcohol or a controlled substances problem is suspected, including confrontation, referral to any employee assistance program and/or referral to a supervisor. 
                  B.  In addition, the city shall provide training for supervisory personnel who will determine whether a covered employee must be tested for alcohol or drug use based on reasonable cause shall include two sixty (60) minute periods of training on the specific, contemporaneous physical, behavioral and performance indicators of probable drug and alcohol use. Additional supervisory training may cover the effects and consequences of drug use on personal health, safety and the work environment. 
                  (Ord. 96-2 § 6, 1996) 
                  2.26.070 - Employee assistance program. 
                  A.  Each employee driver who has violated any aspect of this policy shall be advised of the resources available to the driver in evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of alcohol and use of controlled substances, including the names, addresses and telephone numbers of substance abuse professionals and counselling and treatment programs. Furthermore, each driver employee who engages in any conduct prohibited by this policy shall be evaluated by the city's substance abuse professional, who shall determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and controlled substances use. 
                  B.  No aspect of this policy shall require the city to provide an employee assistance program (EAP) for employees subject to drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this policy and for supervisory personnel. From time to time, the city may provide an EAP for employees subject to drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this policy. The availability of, and eligibility for, benefits under any such EAP shall be governed by the terms of the EAP; however, entry into, or participation in, any EAP shall not excuse an employee from this policy's testing provisions or requirements for removal from duty. 
                  (Ord. 96-2 § 7, 1996) 
                  2.26.080 - Responsibility. 
                  A.  It is the responsibility of each department head to enforce this policy and ensure that all employees and new hires that are covered by DOT regulations are made aware of the policy. Managers and supervisors are responsible for adhering to and communicating this policy during the employment process, new hire orientations, department meetings, etc. 
                  B.  All city employees that are affected by this policy are responsible for ensuring that they are in compliance.

                  2.30.010 - Definitions. 
                  "Reasonable suspicion" means a judgment regarding an employee's behavior, appearance or other evidence found or reported and may be based on, but shall not be limited to: 
                  1.  An on-the-job accident or occurrence where there is evidence to indicate the accident or occurrence was in whole or in part the result of the employee's action or inactions and/or the employee exhibited behavior or in other ways demonstrated that the employee may have illegally been using drugs or was illegally under influence of drugs; or 
                  2.  An on-the-job incident such as a medical emergency that is likely to be attributable to illegal drug use by an employee; or 
                  3.  Direct observation of behavior exhibited by an employee which might render the employee unable to perform the employee's job or which might pose a threat to the safety or health of the employee, fellow employees or the general public; or 
                  4.  Verifiable information that an employee may be illegally using drugs, illegally under the influence of drugs or under the influence of alcohol; or 
                  5.  Physical on-the-job evidence of drug use by an employee; or 
                  6.  Documented deterioration in an employee's job performance that is likely to be attributable to drug use by the employee; or 
                  7.  The results of such other scientific test(s) as may tend to indicate possible use of drugs or alcohol; or 
                  8.  Such other action as would give the city reason to suspect that an employee is under the influence of an illegal drug or alcohol. 
                  "Screening" means the collection and testing of bodily substances administered according to professionally valid procedures in accordance with accepted medical and legal standards.

                  2.30.020 - Reasonable suspicion. 
                  A.  Drug Screening. The city may require any covered employee to submit to screening for the presence of illegal drugs if the city has reasonable suspicion that the employee has used such illegal drugs or is under the influence of illegal drugs while on duty. 
                  B.  Alcohol Screening. The city may require any covered employee to submit to screening for the presence of alcohol if the city has reasonable suspicion that the employee is under the influence of alcohol while on duty.

                  A.  Any employee subject to random drug testing by virtue of this chapter and who produces a positive drug test result revealing the presence of illegal drugs or controlled substances shall be terminated. However, the employee shall have ten (10) days from the date of termination to appeal said termination to the city manager in writing. During said ten (10) days, the employee may rebut the test by producing a negative drug test (of the same kind and from the same testing facility), explain the mitigating circumstances, or offer any other explanation to the city manager. Upon receiving the appeal, if the circumstances so warrant, the city manager shall be empowered to either lessen the disciplinary action to suspension without pay, reinstate the employee, or affirm the termination, as the city manager sees fit in his or her sole discretion. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Code of Ordinances or the personnel policies of the City, the decision on appeal of the city manager shall be final and the employee shall have no further appeal rights. 
                  B.  Any employee who refuses to provide body fluid or otherwise submit to a drug test when requested to do so in accordance with the random drug testing conducted pursuant to this chapter shall be warned orally that such refusal will result in termination from employment. If the employee thereafter continues to refuse to submit to the drug test, the employee shall be terminated from his or her employment.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 13-324, § 1, adopted July 8, 2013, repealed the former Chapter 2.40, §§ 2.40.010—2.40.110, and enacted a new Chapter 2.40 as set out herein. The former Chapter 2.40 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 10-225, § 1, November 8, 2010; Ord. No. 11-259, § 1, October 10, 2011. 

                  2.40.010 - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this code of ethics is to: 
                  A.  Encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials; 
                  B.  Establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the interest of the city; 
                  C.  Require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in matters affecting the city; and 
                  D.  Serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms.

                  2.40.020 - Scope. 
                  The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to all elected or appointed city officials. 
                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, state law and the charter or the city shall be controlling in the event of an actual conflict with the provisions of this code of ethics. This chapter shall be interpreted to supplement, and not replace, said provisions of state law and the charter.

                  2.40.030 - Definitions. 
                  Solely for the purpose of this code of ethics: 
                  A.  "City official" or "official," unless otherwise expressly defined does not include city employees but does mean the mayor, members of the city council, municipal court judges (including substitute judges), city manager, city clerk, city attorney, and all other persons holding positions designated by the city Charter, as amended. The term "city official" also includes all individuals, including city employees, appointed by the mayor and/or city council as appropriate to city authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the mayor and/or city council. 
                  B.  "Decision" means any ordinance, resolution, contract, franchise, formal action or other matter voted on by the city council or other city board or commission, as well as the discussions or deliberations of the council, board, or commission which can or may lead to a vote or formal action by that body. 
                  C.  "Employee" means any person who is a full-time or part-time employee of the city. 
                  D.  "Immediate family" means the spouse, mother, father, grandparent, brother, sister, son or daughter of any city official related by blood, adoption, or marriage. The relationship by marriage shall include in-laws. 
                  E.  "Incidental interest" means an interest in a person, entity, or property which is not a substantial interest as defined herein and which has insignificant value. 
                  F.  "Remote interest" means an interest of a person or entity, including a city official, which would be affected in the same way as the general public. For example, the interest of an official in the property tax rate, general city fees, city utility charges, or a comprehensive zoning ordinance or similar matters is deemed remote to the extent that the official would be affected in common with the general public. 
                  G.  "Substantial interest" means an interest, either directly or through a member of the immediate family, in another person or entity, where: 
                  1.  The interest is ownership of five (5) percent or more of the voting stock, shares, or equity of the entity or ownership of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more of the equity or market value of the entity; or 
                  2.  The funds received by the person from the other person or entity during the previous twelve (12) months either equal or exceed: 
                  (a)  Five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) in salary, bonuses, commissions, or professional fees, or five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) in payment for goods, products, or services, or 
                  (b)  Ten (10) percent of the recipient's gross income during that period, whichever is less; 
                  3.  The person serves as a corporate officer or member of the board of directors or other governing board of a for-profit entity other than a corporate entity owned or created by the city council; or 
                  4.  The person is a creditor, debtor, or guarantor of the other person or entity in an amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more. 
                  (Ord. No. 13-324, § 1, 7-8-2013) 
                  2.40.040 - Prohibitions. 
                  A.  No city official shall use such position to secure special privileges or exemptions for himself or herself or other, or to secure confidential information for any purpose other than official duties on behalf of the city. 
                  B.  No city official, in any matter before the council or other city body, relating to a person or entity in which the official has a substantial interest, shall fail to disclose for the record such interest prior to any discussion or vote or fail to recuse himself/herself from such discussion or vote as applicable. 
                  C.  No city official shall act as an agent or attorney for another in any matter before the city council or other city body. 
                  D.  No city official shall directly or indirectly receive, or agree to receive, any compensation, gift, reward, or gratuity in any matter or proceeding connected with, or related to, the duties of his office except as may be provided by law. 
                  E.  No city official shall enter into any contract with, or have any interest in, either directly or indirectly, the city except as authorized by state law. 
                  1.  This prohibition shall not be applicable to the professional activities of the city attorney in his or her work as an independent contractor and legal advisor on behalf of the city. 
                  2.  This prohibition shall not be applicable to an otherwise valid employment contract between the city and a city official who is not elected (such as, by way of example, a city manager, city administrator, or chief of police). 
                  3.  Any official who has a proprietary interest in an agency doing business with the city shall make that interest known in writing to the city council and the city clerk. 
                  F.  All public funds shall be used for the general welfare of the people and not for personal economic gain. 
                  G.  Public property shall be disposed of in accordance with state law. 
                  H.  No city official shall solicit or accept other employment to be performed or compensation to be received, while still a city official if the employment or compensation could reasonably be expected to impair such official's judgment or performance of city duties. 
                  I.  If a city official accepts or is soliciting a promise of future employment from any person or entity who has a substantial interest in a person, entity, or property which would be affected by any decision upon which the official might reasonably be expected to act, investigate, advise, or make a recommendation, the official shall disclose the fact to the city council and shall recuse himself/herself and take no further action on matters regarding the potential future employer. 
                  J.  No city official shall use city facilities, personnel, equipment, or supplies for private purposes, except to the extent such are lawfully available to the public. 
                  K.  No city official shall grant or make available to any person any consideration, treatment, advantage, or favor beyond that which it is the general practice to grant or make available to the public at large. 
                  L.  A city official shall not directly or indirectly make use of, or permit others to make use of, official information not made available to the general public for the purpose of furthering a private interest. 
                  M.  A city official shall not use his or her position in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, another person to provide any financial benefit to such official or persons within the official's immediate family, or those with whom the official has business or financial ties amounting to a substantial interest. 
                  N.  A city official shall not order any goods or services for the city without prior authorization for such an expenditure. No city official shall attempt to obligate the city nor give the impression of obligating the city without proper prior authorization. 
                  O.  No city official shall draw travel funds or per diem from the city for attendance at meetings, seminars, training, or other educational events and fail to attend such events without promptly reimbursing the city therefor. 
                  P.  No city official shall attempt to unduly influence the outcome of a case before the municipal court of the city nor shall any city official engage in ex parte communication with a municipal court judge of the city on any matter pending before the municipal court of the city. 
                  Q.  No city official shall violate any provision of the code of conduct established by the city council. 
                  (Ord. No. 13-324, § 1, 7-8-2013; Ord. No. 16-388, §1, 3-14-2016) 
                  2.40.050 - Conflict of interest. 
                  A.  A city official may not participate in a vote or decision on a matter affecting an immediate family member or any person, entity, or property in which the official has a substantial interest. 
                  B.  A city official who serves as a corporate officer or member of the board of directors of a nonprofit entity must disclose their interest in said entity to the mayor and council prior to participating in a vote or decision regarding funding of the entity by or through the city. 
                  C.  Where the interest of a city official in the subject matter of a vote or decision is remote or incidental, the city official may participate in the vote or decision and need not disclose the interest. 
                  (Ord. No. 13-324, § 1, 7-8-2013) 
                  2.40.055 - Code of conduct. 
                  A.  Council Member Conduct with One Another. This council is composed of individuals with a wide variety of backgrounds, personalities, values, opinions, and goals. Despite this diversity, each council member has chosen to serve in public office in order to preserve and protect the present and the future of the city of Stockbridge. This common goal should be acknowledged even as council members may "agree to disagree" on contentious issues. 
                  1.  In Public Meetings. 
                  a.  Practice Civility and Decorum in Discussions and Debate. Difficult questions, tough challenges to a particular point of view, and criticism of ideas and information are legitimate elements of a free democracy in action. This does not allow, however, council members to make belligerent, personal, impertinent, slanderous, threatening, abusive, or disparaging comments. No shouting or physical actions that could be construed as threatening will be tolerated. Council members shall preserve order and decorum during council meetings, and shall not, by conversation or other action, delay or interrupt the proceedings or refuse to obey the orders of the presiding officer or this code of conduct. Council members shall, when addressing staff or members of the public, confine themselves to questions or issues then under discussion, shall not engage in personal attacks, shall not impugn the motives of any speaker, and shall at all times, while in session or otherwise, conduct themselves in a manner appropriate to the dignity of their office. 
                  (Examples of misconduct include but are not limited to the following: yelling, shouting, fighting, making unwelcome physical contact, aggressive or bullying behavior, use of foul language, ignoring and/or interrupting the Presiding Officer.) 
                  b.  Honor the Role of the Mayor in Maintaining Order. It is the responsibility of the Mayor to keep the comments of the council members on track during all meetings. Council members should honor efforts by the Presiding Officer to focus discussion on current agenda items. If there is a disagreement about the agenda or the Presiding Officer's actions, those objections should be voiced politely and with reason, following procedures outlined in parliamentary procedures. 
                  c.  Avoid Personal Comments that Could Offend other Council Members. If a council member is personally offended by remarks of another council member, the offended council member should make notes of the actual words used and call for a "point of personal privilege" that challenges the other council member to justify or apologize for the language used. The right of a council member to address the council on a question of personal privilege shall be limited to cases in which his or her integrity, character or motives are assailed, questioned or impugned. The mayor will maintain control of this discussion. 
                  (Examples of misconduct include but are not limited to the following: making personal criticisms, singling out members for ridicule and/or mentioning the names of other council members in a negative light.) 
                  d.  Demonstrate Effective Problem Solving Approaches. Council members have a public stage to show how individuals with disparate points of view can find common ground and seek a compromise that benefits the community as a whole. 
                  e.  Code of Ethics. In addition to the requirements of the city's ethics ordinance, council members shall conduct themselves so as to bring credit upon the city as a whole, and to set an example of good ethical conduct for all citizens of the community. Council members should constantly bear in mind these responsibilities to the entire electorate, and refrain from actions benefiting any individual or special interest group at the expense of the city as a whole. Council members should likewise do everything in their power to insure impartial application of the law to all citizens, and equal treatment of each citizen without regard to race, national origin, sex, social station, or economic position. 
                  2.  In Private Encounters. 
                  a.  Continue Respectful Behavior in Private. The same level of respect and consideration of differing points of view that is deemed appropriate for public discussions should be maintained in private conversations. 
                  b.  Be Aware of the Insecurity (Non Confidentiality) of Written Notes, Voicemail, and Email. Technology allows words written or said without much forethought to be distributed wide and far. Would you feel comfortable to have this note faxed to others? How would you feel if this voicemail message was played on a speakerphone in a full office? What would happen if this Email message were forwarded to others? Written notes, voicemail messages and Email should be treated as potentially "public" communication! 
                  (Examples of misconduct include but are not limited to the following: forwarding e-mails to others without the sender's knowledge or consent; allowing others to have access to official e-mail or voicemail messages; and/or blind copying messages to non-city persons without the recipient's knowledge.) 
                  c.  Even Private Conversations can have Public Presence. Elected officials are always on display—their actions, mannerisms, and language are monitored by people around them that they may not know. Lunch table conversations will be eavesdropped upon, parking lot debates will be watched, and casual comments between individuals before and after public meetings noticed. 
                  d.  Quick Tips: 
                  (1)  Preserve dignity and self-respect. 
                  (2)  Listen for the message even if you don't agree with it. 
                  (3)  Respect others as they are. 
                  (4)  Express your independent perspective. 
                  (5)  Participate intelligently. 
                  (6)  Be willing to delegate and let others make decisions. 
                  (7)  Lead from the front of the parade. 
                  (8)  Control all you should not all you can. 
                  (9)  Use few words after much thought rather than many words after little thought. 
                  (10)  Seek to create change and overcome the influence of conventional wisdom. 
                  (11)  Recognize when you need outside experts. 
                  (12)  Recognize the efforts of others. 
                  (13)  Continuously pursue excellence. 
                  B.  Council Member Conduct with City Staff. Governance of the city of Stockbridge relies on the cooperative efforts of all council members, who set policy, and city staff who implement and administer the council's policies. Therefore, every effort should be made to be cooperative and show mutual respect for the contributions made by each individual for the good of the community. 
                  1.  Treat all Staff as Professionals. Clear, honest communication that respects the abilities, experience, and dignity of each individual is expected. Poor behavior towards staff is not acceptable. 
                  (Examples of misconduct include but are not limited to the following: yelling, shouting, fighting, making unwelcome physical contact, aggressive/bullying behavior and/or use of foul language against a staff member.) 
                  2.  Direct Administrative and Operational Questions to City Management. Questions of city staff and/or requests for additional information that would be of interest to all councilors should be directed to the city manager or designee. The city manager should be copied on any request. Materials supplied to a council member in response to a request will be made available to all members of the council so that all have equal access to information. 
                  3.  When Possible, Keep Communication with City Staff Short, to the Point and at the Best Possible Time. Every effort should be made to limit disruption to the work of city staff. Council members should avoid making requests to staff who are in meetings, on the phone, or engrossed in performing their job functions. 
                  4.  Never Publicly Criticize an Individual Employee. Council members should refrain from expressing concerns about the performance of a city employee in public or to the employee directly. Comments about staff performance should only be made to the city manager through private correspondence or conversation. 
                  5.  Do Not Get Involved in Administrative Functions. Council members shall not attempt to unethically influence or coerce the city manager or department heads concerning either their actions or recommendations to council about personnel, purchasing, awarding contracts, selection of consultants, processing of development applications, or the granting of city licenses and permits. 
                  6.  Check with City Staff on Correspondence Before Taking Action. Before sending correspondence, council members should check with the city manager to see if an official city response has already been sent or is in progress. 
                  7.  Do not Attend City Staff Meetings Unless Requested by Staff. Even if the council member does not say anything, the council member's presence implies support, or may show partiality, intimidate staff, and hamper staffs ability to do their job objectively. 
                  8.  Legal Advice. Before requesting research or other action by the city attorney, council members are encouraged to consider consulting with the city manager or obtain the concurrence of council to ascertain whether the request or action can be accomplished more cost-effectively by alternative means. 
                  C.  Council Member Conduct with the Public. Making the public feel welcome is an important part of the democratic process. No signs of partiality, prejudice, or disrespect should be evident on the part of individual council members toward an individual participating in a public forum. Every effort should be made to be fair and impartial in listening to public testimony. 
                  1.  In Public Meetings. 
                  a.  Be Welcoming to Speakers and Treat Them with Care and Gentleness. Because personal concerns are often the issue of those who come to present to the council, council members should remember that how they treat the speaker will either help them relax or push their emotions to a higher level of intensity. 
                  (Examples of misconduct include but are not limited to the following: yelling, shouting, arguing and/or otherwise exhibiting rude behavior towards speakers.) 
                  b.  Give the Appearance of Active Listening. It is disconcerting to speakers to have council members not look at them when they are speaking. It is fine to look down at documents or to make notes, but reading for a long period of time or gazing around the room gives the appearance of disinterest. Be aware of facial expressions, especially those that could be interpreted as "smirking," disbelief, anger, or boredom. 
                  c.  Ask for Clarification, But Avoid Debate and Argument With the Public. Only the chair (and not individual council members) may interrupt a speaker during a presentation. However, a council member may ask the mayor for a "point of order" if the speaker is off the topic or exhibiting behavior or language the council member finds disturbing. If speakers become flustered or defensive by council questions, it is the responsibility of the mayor to calm and focus the speaker and to maintain the order and decorum of the meeting. Questions by council members to members of the public should seek to clarify or expand information. It is never appropriate to belligerently challenge or belittle the speaker. Council member's personal opinions or inclinations about upcoming votes should not be revealed until after the public hearing. 
                  d.  No Personal Attacks of any Kind, Under any Circumstances. Council members should be aware that their body language and tone of voice, as well as the words they use, can appear to be intimidating or aggressive. 
                  2.  In Unofficial Meetings. 
                  a.  Make no Promises on Behalf of the Council or Staff. It is inappropriate to overtly or implicitly promise council action, or to promise city staff will do something specific (i.e. fix a pothole, replace flowers, fix a leak, etc.) When approached by the public to correct a situation, council members should refer them to the city manager. 
                  b.  Speak with One Voice. Council members will frequently be asked to explain a council action or to give their opinion about an issue as they meet and talk with constituents in the community. It is appropriate to give a brief overview of the facts or city policies as they relate to council action. Objectively present the council's collective decision or direction, even when you may not agree. If you feel the need to express your own opinion, state it in terms such as: "I would have preferred "x" but the council wanted "y" so that's what we will be doing," Explaining council decisions, without giving your personal criticism of the council's actions, will serve to strengthen the community's image of the city council. 
                  (Examples of misconduct include but are not limited to the following: acting in a manner contrary to the official expressed will of the council; activing working against the stated objectives of the council; and/or representing other interests against the interests of the city.) 
                  c.  Make no Personal Comments About Other Council Members. It is acceptable to publicly disagree about an issue, but it is unacceptable to make derogatory comments about other council members, their opinions, and their actions. Honesty and respect for the dignity of each individual should be reflected in every word and action taken by council members. It is a serious and continuous responsibility. 
                  (Examples of misconduct include but are not limited to the following: While in public or on social media, making personal criticisms, singling out members for ridicule and/or mentioning the names of other council members in a negative light.) 
                  D.  The Stockbridge Council Principles of Proper Conduct: 
                  •  Keep promises.

                  A.  All complaints against city officials shall be filed with the city clerk, who will give it to the mayor and council. The mayor and council may require that oral complaints, and complaints illegibly or informally drawn, be reduced to a memorandum of complaint in such form as may be prescribed by the city council. Upon receipt of a complaint in proper form, the city clerk or clerk's designee shall forward a copy of the complaint to the chairman of the board of ethics, and to the city official or officials charged in the complaint, within no more than seven (7) calendar days. 
                  B.  All complaints shall be submitted and signed under oath, shall be legibly drawn, and shall clearly address matters within the scope of this section. 
                  C.  Upon receipt of a complaint in proper form, the board shall review it to determine whether the complaint is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or fails to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the city council. The board of ethics is empowered to dismiss in writing complaints that it determines are unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded, or failing to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the city council; provided, however, that a rejection of such complaint by the board of ethics shall not deprive the complaining party of any action such party might otherwise have at law or in equity against the city official. For complaints that are not dismissed, the board of ethics is empowered to collect evidence and information concerning any complaint and add the findings and results of its investigations to the file containing such complaint. 
                  D.  Upon completion of its investigation of a complaint, the board of ethics is empowered to dismiss in writing those complaints which it determines are unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded, or which fail to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the city council; provided, however, that a rejection of such complaint by the board of ethics shall not deprive the complaining party of any action such party might otherwise have at law or in equity against the city official. 
                  E.  The board of ethics is empowered to conduct investigations, to take evidence, and to hold hearings to address the subject matter of a complaint. 
                  F.  The board of ethics is empowered to adopt forms for formal complaints, notices, and any other necessary or desirable documents within its jurisdiction where the city council has not prescribed such forms. 
                  G.  Findings of the board of ethics shall be submitted to the city council for action. 
                  H.  To discourage the filing of ethics complaints solely for political purposes, complaints will not be accepted against a person seeking election as a city official, whether currently serving as a city official or not, from the date qualifying opens for the elected office at issue through the date the election results for that office are certified. The time for filing complaints will not run during this period. Properly filed complaints will be accepted and processed after the election results have been certified.

Service may be by personal service, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by statutory overnight delivery. A hearing shall be held within sixty (60) calendar days after the filing of the complaint. The board of ethics shall conduct hearings in accordance with the procedures and regulations it establishes but, in all circumstances, at least one (1) hearing shall include the taking of testimony and the cross-examination of available witnesses. The decision of the board of ethics shall be rendered to mayor and council within seven (7) calendar days after completion of the final hearing. At any hearing held by the board of ethics, the city official who is the subject of inquiry shall have the right to written notice of the hearing and the allegations at least seven (7) calendar days before the first hearing, to be represented by counsel, to hear and examine the evidence and witnesses, and to oppose or try to mitigate the allegations. The city official subject to the inquiry shall also have the right but not the obligation of submitting evidence and calling witnesses. Failure to comply with any of the time deadlines in this section shall not invalidate any otherwise valid complaint or in any way affect the power or jurisdiction of the board of ethics or the city council to act upon any complaint.

                  B.  An action for judicial review may be commenced by filing an application for a writ of certiorari in the Superior Court of Henry County within thirty (30) days after the decision of the board of ethics. The filing of such application shall act as a supersedeas.

                  3.04.040 - Delinquent debts. 
                  A.  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases shall, for the purposes of this chapter and except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning, be defined as follows: 
                  "Account payable" is any debt owed by the city to another person or entity. 
                  "Account receivable" is any debt owed to the city by another person or entity. 
                  "Bad debt" is a debt or any portion thereof which has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under professional standards employed by licensed accountants and auditors. 
                  "Debt" means any outstanding or unpaid fee, tax, charge, bill, permit, fine or account which is due and payable to the city, regardless of source. For purposes of this chapter, the term shall also include any fees, costs, penalties, expenses or interest which may be due and payable to the city as a result of, or incident to, a debt. 
                  "Debtor" means any person owing a debt to the city. 
                  "Delinquent debt" means any debt which remains unpaid for a period of thirty (30) days or more from the due date. 
                  "Due date" is the date upon which a debt becomes due and payable. 
                  B.  Collection of Delinquent Debts. The city manager or his designee shall be responsible for monitoring the status of the debts owed to the city. In the event any debt remains unpaid for more than ninety (90) days, the city manager or his designee may, but shall not be required to, take one (1) or more of the following actions: (1) initiate collection efforts on behalf of the city in any manner prescribed by law; or (2) issue and record a writ of fieri facias (fi. fa.) and execution as provided for by law; or (3) refer the same to the city attorney for collection through civil action; or (4) assign the delinquent debt to a collection agency; or (5) forwarding to the Tax Commissioner of Henry County the amount of the debt(s) for collection by placing the amount of the debt(s) on the ad valorem tax bill of the person or entity owing the debt(s). All funds so collected under any method shall be remitted to the city. 
                  To the extent authorized by law, the city shall have lien rights for the collection of debt(s) due the city. Lien rights may be perfected through the filing of a writ of fieri ficias (fi. fa.) against all property of the person or entity who owes the debt(s). Upon issuance of the fi. fa., recording the same on the General Execution Docket of the Superior Court, and forwarding of same to the sheriff, the sheriff shall be authorized, pursuant to the laws of the state of Georgia, to levy same upon the property of the person or entity owing the debt to satisfy the amount owed to the city. 
                  A fi. fa. issued upon a judgment issued by any court of this state can be recorded on the General Execution Docket of the Superior Court of any other county in this state. The sheriff of the county in which the fi. fa. is recorded and property of the debtor is located shall be authorized to levy same upon the property of the owner to satisfy the fi. fa. and the debt(s) owed to the city. 
                  C.  Determination of Bad Debt. The city manager or his designee shall be authorized to determine if a delinquent debt under one hundred dollars ($100.00) constitutes a bad debt under this chapter. In the event such a determination is made, it shall be recorded on the official records of the city along with the basis for the determination, and said records shall be available to the public for inspection. 
                  The city council shall be responsible for determining if any delinquent debt of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more constitutes a bad debt. In the event such a determination is made, it shall be recorded on the minutes of the city and available to the public for inspection. Provided, however, that the failure to so record an official determination under this subsection shall not impair the city's action in any way. 
                  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a delinquent debt which remains uncollected for a period of three (3) years after the due date shall be deemed a bad debt absent affirmative action to the contrary by the city council. 
                  D.  Treatment of Bad Debts. Bad debts shall be charged off solely for accounting, tax and audit purposes in the manner prescribed by law and standard accounting procedures. In the event the bad debt is subsequently collected or paid, in whole or in part, the city manager or his designee shall report that payment during the reporting period in which the payment is made. 
                  E.  No Forgiveness of Debts. No action by the city council, city manager or his designee, city attorney, or any other entity engaged by the city for collection purposes shall be construed as forgiving any debt owed to the city or taking any other action which is contrary to the Georgia Constitution.

                  3.04.050 - Rules governing payments by check. 
                  A.  General. All sums due the city, including but not limited to ad valorem taxes, occupation taxes, fines, forfeitures, penalties, license fees, permit fees and registration fees, may be paid by the use of personal checks issued by a person or business entity ("Payor") which comply with the procedures, if any, adopted by the city for acceptance of check payments. 
                  B.  Charge for Returned Checks. Upon notification by a financial institution that a check presented to the city will be returned for insufficient funds ("NSF") because it is not properly payable or for any other reason, the city shall be authorized to charge the payor a penalty equal to $25.00 for each returned check or instrument. The city may, but shall not be required to, post a notice to this effect at one or more places where payments are delivered to the city. 
                  C.  Liability for Payment of Obligation. No person making payment by check to the city is released from liability for the underlying obligation except to the extent that this city actually receives final payment of the obligation in cash or its equivalent. If final payment is not paid by the payor, a financial institution, or any other guarantor of payment in the transaction, the underlying obligation for money due is not extinguished. All applicable penalties, interest and collection fees on the unpaid amount shall be due from the payor. 
                  Such penalties, interest and fees on any unpaid amount shall accrue from the date the unpaid obligation is first due under the applicable statute or ordinance. The city shall follow the collection procedures for the unpaid amount that would have otherwise been applicable had the check payment not been attempted.

                  The treasurer after consultation with the city manager shall be authorized to reallocate departmental appropriations among various line item expenditures within that department as said the treasurer believes necessary. The treasurer shall also be authorized to effect interdepartmental transfers, in the same fund, not to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). Any such transfers shall identify particular functions that will use the transferred funds, and shall be reported to the city council at its next regular meeting and shall be entered in the minutes, as well as, reported in the monthly financial statements.

                  3.16.301 - Tax remittance. 
                  A.  All taxes levied by this article shall be due and payable to the city clerk or designated representative of the City of Stockbridge monthly, on or before the twentieth (20th) day of every month next succeeding each respective month in which taxes are collected, and payment shall be accompanied by return for the preceding monthly period showing the gross rent, rent from permanent residents, taxable rent, amount of tax collected or otherwise due for a period, and such other information as may be required by the city clerk or governing authority of the City of Stockbridge. However, if the estimated tax liability for any monthly period shall exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for a lodging provider who, in the prior fiscal year remitted tax greater than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) in any three (3) consecutive months, such operator shall file an estimated return and remit not less than fifty percent (50%) of the estimated tax liability for the monthly period by the twentieth (20th) day of that same monthly period.

                  C.  In the event that an operator is permitted under applicable state guidelines to make quarterly sales tax returns to the State of Georgia, said Operator shall be permitted to make quarterly sales tax returns to City of Stockbridge, Georgia. At the time of registration, the operator shall indicate that he is permitted to make quarterly sales tax returns together with month and day said quarterly returns are due. The failure of the operator to indicate that he is permitted under applicable state statue to file quarterly reports will infer that monthly reports are due and collectable. 
                  D.  At the time any such report is due, the operator shall file a copy of the corresponding state sales tax return for the sole purpose of verifying the sums reported and due. 
                  E.  In the event an operator is permitted under applicable state guidelines to file annual excise, or lodging tax returns, to the State of Georgia, said operator is required to file monthly or quarterly returns for lodging tax to the City of Stockbridge, Georgia. 
                  F.  In the event there are no rentals in a reporting period, lodging providers are required to file a return to the City of Stockbridge, Georgia stating they had zero rentals for the period.

                  D.  In addition, the amount of the determination made hereunder shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month, or a fraction thereof, from the twentieth day of the month following the monthly period for which the amount or any portion thereof should have been returned, until the day of payment. 
                  E.  The estimated tax together with applicable penalties and interest may be collected utilizing any of the enforcement methods set forth in this article.

                  3.30.060 - Ethics. 
                  It is the policy of the City of Stockbridge to seek the best overall value when procuring goods and services. Toward this end, the city finds and declares that its objectives will best be achieved through an open, competitive process with a broad range of responsible vendors wishing to furnish products and services to the city. The City of Stockbridge will set up and conduct a procurement program that maximizes service benefit to the community and awards contracts to vendors who offer the best value. 
                  A.  The City of Stockbridge declares that city employees and officials along with those wishing to do business with the city have the shared responsibility for avoiding biased, anticompetitive or unethical practices when such receipt has the potential to influence a procurement decision or to gain undue advantage in a procurement competition. 
                  B.  The purchasing agent and every officer and employee of the city whose duties involve the purchase or sale of goods and/or services, or the preparation of specifications for the purchase of goods and/or services for the city, or deciding which goods shall be declared surplus are expressly prohibited from seeking, requesting, or receiving any material payment, gift, job offer, security, promise of future benefit, or any other tangible or intangible thing of value, directly or indirectly, from any person, company, firm or corporation which seeks to do business with or contract with the city or has contracted with the city within the preceding twelve (12) months, or to which any purchase order or contract is awarded, or to whom any surplus goods may be sold. 
                  C.  Prospective vendors must compete for city business within the parameters of the solicitation process and are prohibited from seeking to obtain inside information, attempting to skew the writing of specifications or influencing a procurement decision through any means outside the process established for the particular solicitation.

                  D.  The city's ethics ordinance and City Charter should be consulted for requirements related to lobbying and representation of business interests that come before the city council or city officials for decision. 
                  E.  Ethical business practices are important both during a solicitation and after the decision to grant an award. To this end, the city seeks to establish relationships with business partners whose ongoing ethical standards of business conduct are congruent with those outlined here. The purchasing agent is charged with establishing methods for ongoing monitoring for non-compliance with these principles. The prohibition against the offering of or the acceptance of gifts, favors, kickbacks, gratuities, payments or any other thing of value extends beyond and outside any specific procurement or solicitation. 
                  F.  A vendor's contract compliance history with the City of Stockbridge and other contractual parties is a valid element in the decision to award a solicitation.

                  3.30.070 - Evasion prohibited.

                  (Ord. No. OR 13-301, § 1, 3-11-2013) 
                  3.30.080 - Summary of methods of procurement. 
                  In most cases, this chapter recognizes seven methods of procurement and the conditions where each method shall be used. 
                  A.  Informal Purchase. Those purchases fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or less do not justify the administrative time and expense for the conduct of competitive sealed bids or proposals. 
                  B.  Competitive Sealed Bidding. In most cases the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of procurement in the public sector and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions must be met: 
                  1.  Clear and adequate specifications are available. 
                  2.  Three (3) or more responsible bidders are willing to participate in the process. 
                  3.  Cost of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). 
                  4.  Revenue is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). 
                  C.  Competitive Sealed Proposal. When use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as: 
                  1.  Whether quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services. 
                  2.  Whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest. 
                  3.  Whether a fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous. 
                  4.  Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award. 
                  5.  Cost of equipment, services or project is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). 
                  6.  Revenue is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). 
                  D.  Sole Source Purchase. A sole source procurement may be used when only one (1) vendor or supplier is able to fill requirements for the intended use. Sole source may be used for compatibility with equipment for repair purposes, or for compatibility with existing systems. Standardization may require a sole source procurement, depending upon the intended use. Standardization, which is either established as a result of past procurement(s) or by approval of the city manager, can be a satisfactory justification for a sole source. The city council shall approve all purchases where cost is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). 
                  E.  Emergency Purchase. The purchasing agent shall have the authority to purchase commodities and services where there exists an emergency constituting a threat to public health, safety or welfare or to the soundness and integrity of public property or to the delivery of essential services and where the adverse effects of such emergency may worsen materially with the passage of time. Acquisitions shall be made using such competitive procedures as circumstances reasonably permit. Emergencies shall be documented by the using department and submitted to the purchasing office. When a situation exists where time does not permit involvement of the purchasing office, the user department director is authorized to purchase necessary commodities or make necessary repairs. For emergencies where cost exceeds the amount authorized to a using department, written documentation shall be prepared by the user department director and submitted to the purchasing office explaining the nature of the emergency. All emergencies where cost is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) require ratification of the city council. 
                  F.  Cooperative Purchase. The city may participate in a cooperative purchase for commodities, supplies and services when determined that it is in the best interest of the city. The sponsoring entity, whether federal, state or local must have performed a competitive procurement process and entered into a contract that stipulates allowance for other governmental entities to purchase from the supplier at the same price and under the same terms and conditions as extended to it. If such arrangement has not been made a part of the contract, written permission from the sponsoring entity and the awarded supplier must be obtained. Documentation to substantiate this decision will be maintained by the purchasing office. Cooperative purchases where the cost is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) shall be approved by the city council. 
                  G.  Governmental and Affiliated Entity Purchase. The city may purchase services and incidental commodities from other federal, state or local governments, associations and non-profit organizations when determined to be in the best interest of the city. Documentation to substantiate this decision will be maintained by the purchasing office. Such purchases where cost is greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) shall be approved by the City of Stockbridge City Council. 
                  (Ord. No. OR 13-301, § 1, 3-11-2013)

                  B.  All Other Contracts. The purchasing agent is authorized to determine that a process for mandatory pre-qualification for competitive sealed bids and competitive sealed proposals of bidders or proposers is appropriate for the procurement of a particular commodity or service, subject to these requirements: 
                  1.  Criteria for pre-qualification shall be reasonably related to the project or the quality of the work. 
                  2.  Criteria for pre-qualification shall be available to any prospective bidder requesting such information. 
                  3.  There shall be a method of notifying prospective bidders of the criteria for pre-qualification. 
                  4.  There shall be a procedure for a disqualified bidder to respond to his or her disqualification to the purchasing agent; however, such procedure shall not include a formal appeal. 
                  5.  No bid or proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the city from a prospective bidder who has not been pre-qualified on the procurement in question where the invitation to bid or request for proposals specified that pre-qualification would be mandatory, and any bid or proposal received shall be returned to the prospective bidder unopened.

                  3.30.090 - Purchases based on informal procurement. 
                  A.  General. Procurements that involve amounts fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or less do not require a formal sealed bid/proposal process. However, the processes used for this type of procurement will include as much competition as is consistent with the anticipated cost of the procurement and the best interest of the city. 
                  B.  Prohibition of Improper Use of Informal Purchase Process. Purchases may not be artificially divided as to constitute an informal purchase, thereby circumventing the dollar limit requirement for competitive sealed bids/proposals. 
                  C.  Procedures. Procurement within this category shall be made in accordance with the informal purchase procedures established by the purchasing agent. These procedures will cover purchases delegated to user departments as well as those handled through the central procurement process. Such operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for the supply, service or construction being purchased. Further, such operational procedures shall require the preparation and maintenance of written records to adequately document the competition obtained, properly account for the funds expended and facilitate audit/review of the transaction. 
                  D.  Types of Informal Purchases. Informal purchases are classified by two (2) categories: 
                  1.  Those that may be made directly by the using department. 
                  2.  Those that are required to be made through the central procurement process. 
                  E.  Informal purchase by user departments. 
                  1.  Authority. Each user department is granted the authority, at the discretion of the department director or city manager, to handle purchases where the cost is less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). 
                  2.  Prohibition of Misuse. Purchases may not be artificially divided in order to qualify for handling by the using departments. Neither shall this process be used for frequently recurring acquisitions that warrant volume purchases or periodic term contracts. 
                  F.  Informal Purchases by Purchasing Staff. 
                  1.  Purchasing staff shall obtain commodities and services competitively through telephone solicitations where cost is five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or less. A minimum of three (3) quotations is required unless adequate source supply is not available. 
                  2.  Purchasing staff shall obtain commodities and services competitively through written quotations where cost is five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). A minimum of three (3) written quotations is required unless adequate source supply is not available. 
                  (Ord. No. OR 13-301, § 1, 3-11-2013) 
                  3.30.100 - Competitive sealed bids. 
                  A.  Acquisitions Greater Than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00). Any commodity that is expected to cost or generate revenue greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) shall be acquired through the competitive sealed bid process except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
                  B.  Dissemination of Invitation to Bid. Public notice of an invitation to bid shall be given as required by Georgia law. The public notice shall contain a general description of the purchase, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of bid opening. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be posted in the purchasing office. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing agent. 
                  C.  Receipt of Bid. No written bid shall be eligible for consideration by the city unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the purchasing office by the date and time specified in the invitation to bid. All bids shall be stamped or annotated with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time. A bid delivered late shall under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the city. 
                  D.  Bid Opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one (1) or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the invitation to bid. The name of each bidder, the purchase price contained in each bid, and such other information as the purchasing agent deems appropriate shall be announced as the bids are opened. A record of bid information shall be recorded and available for public inspection. 
                  E.  Modification of Bid. Any clerical mistake that is patently obvious on the face of a bid, subject to the limitations described below, may be corrected upon written request and verification, submitted by the bidder. A non-material omission in a bid may be corrected if the purchasing agent determines the correction to be in the city's best interest. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening: 
                  1.  Price information. 
                  2.  Any required bonding. 
                  F.  Withdrawal of Bid. Bids may be withdrawn at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, withdrawal of bid shall be based upon the following: 
                  1.  The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid due to an error within two (2) business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure. 
                  2.  Bids may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. The bidder's original work papers shall be the sole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if request is made to withdraw the bid. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid. 
                  G.  Bid Evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the solicitation. 
                  H.  Bid Cancellation. An invitation to bid may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the city in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing office or, as a result of improper conduct on the part of a city employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the bid file. 
                  I.  Bid Award. 
                  1.  Responsive and Responsible Bidder(s). Subject to approval by the city council, bids shall be awarded to the responsible bidder(s) who have submitted the lowest cost responsive bid(s), highest revenue responsive bid(s), or whose bid represents the best value to the city. 
                  2.  Approval of Bid. All bid awards for amounts greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) (cost or revenue) shall be approved by the city council. 
                  3.  Rejection or Deferral of Bid. The purchasing agent may reject bids, or may defer bid awards to allow time for additional evaluation or review of bids or for other business purposes, consistent with the best interest of the city. 
                  4.  Disqualification of Bid. The following types of bids shall be disqualified for consideration for a bid award: 
                  a.  A proposal submitted without required bonds. 
                  b.  A proposal submitted by an individual, firm or business on the ineligible source list. 
                  c.  A proposal which is incomplete in any material fact. 
                  d.  A proposal submitted by an individual, firm or business that has litigation pending against the city, or anyone representing a firm or business in litigation against the city, not arising out of the procurement process. 
                  5.  Tie Bids. In the event two (2) responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the two (2) bids are substantially the same, the bid shall be awarded to the local vendor if only one of the bidders has an office located within the boundaries of the City of Stockbridge. If both or neither of the tied bidders are local vendors, the purchasing staff shall request the firm's best and final offers, and the award shall be to the lowest bid. 
                  6.  Local Preference. In the event that a responsive, responsible non-local business submits the lowest price bid, and the bid submitted by one (1) or more responsive, responsible local businesses is within five percent (5%) of the price submitted by the non-local business (and the other terms and conditions of the two bids are substantially the same), then that local business shall have the opportunity to submit, within five (5) working days of the notice of intent to award, a final bid equal to or lower than the amount of the low bid previously submitted by the non-local business. The contract shall then be awarded to the responsive, responsible business submitting the lowest best and final bid. 
                  For purposes of this sub-section, the term "local business" shall mean a vendor with a valid occupational license issued by the city (or its designee) at least one (1) year prior to bid or proposal opening to do business in the city that authorizes the business to provide the goods, services, or construction to be purchased by the city, and which possesses a physical address located within the city limits of the city in an area zoned for the conduct of such business, from which the vendor operates or performs business on a day-to-day basis that is a substantial component of the goods or services being offered to the city. Post office boxes are not verifiable and shall not be used for the purpose of establishing said physical address. In order to be eligible for the local preference herein, the vendor must provide a copy of the occupational tax license(s) for the covered period prior to recommendation for award. 
                  (Ord. No. 13-323, § 1, 7-8-2013; Ord. No. 13-301, § 1, 3-11-2013) 
                  3.30.110 - Competitive sealed proposals. 
                  A.  Acquisitions Greater Than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00). Any item or service which is expected to cost or generate revenue greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), when the competitive sealed bid process is not applicable nor in the best interest of the city, shall be acquired through the competitive sealed proposal process except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
                  B.  Dissemination of Proposal. Proposals shall be disseminated through a request for proposal. Public notice shall be advertised as required by Georgia law.

                  E.  Proposal Cancellation. A request for proposals may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the city in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing office or as a result of improper conduct on the part of a city employee.

                  F.  Proprietary Information. Information submitted by a proposer that is specifically marked "proprietary" shall not be disclosed outside of the purchasing office without prior notification to the proposer. The City of Stockbridge is required to comply with the Georgia Open Records Act, O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq. and therefore may not be able to protect information submitted in any response. Entire proposals may not be deemed "proprietary." 
                  G.  Evaluation of Proposal. 
                  1.  Initial Evaluation. Each proposal shall be evaluated to determine whether it is responsive to the specifications and other terms and conditions contained in the request for proposals. With the approval of the purchasing associate named in the solicitation, the evaluating team may communicate with each proposer to clarify and amplify each proposer's proposal. No information concerning any other proposer's proposal shall be communicated in any way to the proposer.

                  1.  Responsive and Responsible Proposal. Award shall be made to the responsive and responsible proposer whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the city based upon the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal.

                  A.  Declaration of Unserviceability. The city council shall determine whether a particular item or category of personal property can no longer be used advantageously by the city and has therefore become unserviceable. The city council may establish criteria establishing unserviceability for categories of personal property which may become unserviceable on a regular, frequently recurring basis, and may delegate to the city manager the determination of whether a particular commodity meets the criteria of unserviceability for its category. 
                  B.  Disposition. Unserviceable personal property may be sold by public sale, sealed bidding, spot bidding or any other means deemed most advantageous to the city under the particular circumstances as determined by the city council. A sale to a private person shall be for the highest net purchase price reasonably obtainable by the city. A sale to another unit of government shall be for a fair and reasonable purchase price that need not be as high as the purchase price obtainable from a private person.

All sureties should be licensed to do business in the State of Georgia, must have the ratings established by the treasurer and be listed in the finance division's publication of companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable reinsuring companies. In lieu of the bid bond described above, a bidder or proposer may submit with the bid or proposal a cashier's check payable to the City of Stockbridge in an amount as specified in the bid or proposal. To the extent permitted by Georgia law, a guaranteed letter of credit in the proper amount will act as a bid bond, provided that the form of such letter of credit and the lending institution have been approved by the city in advance.

                  A contractor's failure to participate in the federal work authorization program as defined by O.C.G.A. § 13-10-90 et seq. shall be sanctioned by termination of the contract and any other active contracts between the contractor and the city. If it is determined that a subcontractor is not participating in the federal work authorization program as defined by O.C.G.A. § 13-10-90 et seq., the City of Stockbridge shall direct the contractor to terminate that subcontractor. A contractor's failure to follow the City of Stockbridge's instruction to terminate a subcontractor that is not participating in the federal work authorization program as defined by O.C.G.A. § 13-10-90 et seq. shall be sanctioned by termination of the contract and any other active contract between the contractor and the city. 
                  Any contractor found to be in non-compliance as defined by O.C.G.A. § 13-10-90 et seq. shall be placed on the city's ineligible vendor list for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination date of the contract. 
                  The above requirements shall be in addition to the requirements of state and federal law, and shall be construed to be in conformity with those laws.

                  3.30.332 - Supplier diversity policy. 
                  There is hereby established the following supplier diversity policy for the City of Stockbridge: 
                  The city is committed to diversifying the suppliers of its contracted goods and services and has elected to do so by maximizing the opportunities for local, veteran-owned, minority, women, and disadvantaged business enterprises to participate in the city's contracts. Accordingly, the city has established this supplier diversity policy in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
                  It is the policy of the city to ensure that all VOBs, MBEs, WBEs and DBEs (as defined below) have an equal oppo1tunity to receive and participate in city contracts. It is also the city's policy: 
                  •  To ensure nondiscrimination in the award and administration of all city contracts; 
                  •  To create a level playing field on which VOBs, MBEs, WBEs and DBEs can compete fairly for city contracts; 
                  •  To ensure that the Supplier Diversity Policy is narrowly tailored in accordance with applicable law; and 
                  •  To help remove barriers to the participation ofVOBs, MBEs, WBEs and DBEs in city contracts. 
                  A.  Definitions. 
                  "Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)" is a for-profit small business concern that is at least fifty-one (51) percent owned by one (1) or more individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged or, in the case of a publicly owned business, at least fifty-one (51) percent of all classes of the stock are owned by one (1) or more such individuals; whose management, policies, major decisions and daily business operations are independently managed and controlled by one (1) or more of the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who own it; is a Small Business Enterprise as defined by the U.S. Small Business Administration regulations (13 CFR Part 121), averaged over three (3) years; and the person(s) meeting the criteria, as socially and economically disadvantaged, cannot have a personal net value over one million three hundred twenty thousand dollars ($1,320,000.00). 
                  "Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) is a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation owned, operated and controlled by Minority Group Members who (a) have at least fifty-one (51) percent ownership of the business entity; (b) maintain day-to-day operational and managerial control of the business entity; and (c) have interest in capital and earning commensurate with the Minority Group Member(s)' percentage of ownership. 
                  "Women's Business Enterprise (WBE)" is a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation owned, operated and controlled by one (1) or more women who (a) have at least fifty-one (51) percent ownership of the business entity; (b) maintain day-to-day operational and managerial control of the business entity; and (c) have an interest in capital and earnings commensurate with women's percentage of ownership. 
                  "Veteran-Owned Business (VOB)" is a veteran-owned business (VOB) concern that is not less than fifty-one (51) percent owned by one (1) or more veterans, or in the case of any publicly owned business, not less than fifty-one (51) percent of the stock of which is owned by one (1) or more veterans; the management and daily business operations of which are controlled by one or more veterans. 
                  B.  Diversity Goal. Based on applicable law, the city may (1) set goals for the participation of VOBs, MBEs, WBEs and DBEs for any contracting opportunity; (2) help the prime contractor find qualified VOB, MBE, WBE and DBE subcontractors; and (3) monitor the performance of the prime contractor to ensure that it is using good faith efforts to meet the participation goals. Regardless of whether or not a goal is established for a contracting opportunity, the city encourages the full participation of all qualified businesses. 
                  The city has established a goal of insuring that at least twenty-five (25) percent of the value of all contracting opportunities is awarded to qualified YOBS, MBEs, WBEs and DBEs. 
                  C.  Local Vendor Preference. There is established in Stockbridge, a local vendor privilege. Bids or proposals awarded to local vendors contribute to the local tax base and will therefore, be given special consideration when bidding against out of jurisdiction (out-of-city) vendors. Bids or proposals received from local vendors may be given additional consideration in the form of additional points or other similar measures within the discretion of the staff so long as they are otherwise qualified and capable of delivering any goods or performing the work or services requested by the city. 
                  A local vendor shall only be eligible to receive the benefit of this privilege if it meets each of the following requirements, as verified by the purchasing department, prior to any award of a contract or purchase: 
                  1.  The business or supplier must operate and maintain a regular place of business within the geographical boundaries of the city; 
                  2.  The business or supplier must provide a copy of a current occupational tax certificate; 
                  3.  The business or supplier must have paid all real and personal taxes (if any) owed the city and not otherwise owe the city any funds; and 
                  4.  The business or supplier must certify its compliance with the Georgia Security and Immigration Act. 
                  This policy shall not apply to any bid or proposal for material, equipment or services in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00). In such cases, the bid award shall be subject to the competitive bidding requirements as otherwise provided herein or general law. 
                  D.  Ensuring Performance. It is the City's expectation that all prime contractors use their best good faith efforts to assist the city in meeting its supplier diversity goals. Best faith efforts can be demonstrated in a numerous ways. It is strongly encouraged that prime contractors utilize the numerous resources available to them to identify qualified VOBs, MBEs, WBEs and DBEs.

A false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated for the first time by unusual conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to the control of the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the alarm systems coordinator to test the system. An alarm is false within the meaning of this chapter when, upon investigation or inspection by city employees, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, burglary, robbery, or such other crime was committed or attempted and no fire or other emergency existed in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system.

                  A.  The city of Stockbridge finds that: 
                  1.  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy non-smokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer. 
                  2.  Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities and cancer. 
                  B.  Accordingly, the city council finds and declares that the purpose of this chapter is: 
                  1.  To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and public and private places of employment; 
                  2.  To guarantee the right of non-smokers to breathe smoke-free air; and 
                  3.  To recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

Failure to pay the charges assessed shall constitute a violation of this chapter punishable by the municipal court of the city in accordance with Section 5.12.410 of this chapter. 
                  B.  In addition to any fine or sentence imposed by the municipal court, the city may, in its sole discretion, suspend sanitation services (garbage pickup and disposal) to any customer or property that has failed to timely pay for services provided by, or on behalf of, the city. Before services are suspended the customer shall be notified, in writing, either by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by leaving notice on the front door or main entrance to the property. Said writing shall notify the customer or resident of the delinquency, the amount owed, and that the designated services will be suspended within ten (10) days of the customer's receipt of the certified mail or within ten (10) days of the leaving of the notice at the door of the property.

The city clerk shall have the authority to rectify any errors in customer billing. 
                  C.  In addition to any fine or sentence imposed by the municipal court, for charges assessed for sanitation services (garbage pickup and disposal) provided by, or on behalf of, the city, including penalties, a lien shall be created against the property served, including real property. The lien shall be automatically created and perfected against the property when the charges for sanitation services become due without further action by the city, and this section shall operate to notify all persons of the lien created hereby. Any assessment authorized under this section, the interest thereon, and the expense of collection shall be a lien against the property so assessed coequal with the lien of other taxes and shall be enforced in the same manner as are state and county ad valorem property taxes by issuance of a fi. fa. and levy and sale as set forth in title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. The lien shall run with the property and shall not be extinguished by the transfer of the liened property by sale, foreclosure, or other method. The city may, in its sole discretion, refuse water, sewer, or sanitation services to any property upon which a lien exists.

A sanitation charge bill may be sent through the United States mail or by an alternate means notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date payment is due, and the past due date. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records of Henry County, shall be ultimately obligated to pay such sanitation service charge. If a customer is under-billed or if no bill is sent, the city may back bill for a period of up to one (1) year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency. A one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month late charge shall be billed based on the unpaid balance of any sanitation charge that becomes delinquent. 
                  B.  The sanitation service charges may be billed through any reasonable method as determined and published by the city council. Said methods from which the city may elect to bill a property owner include but are not limited to: on a common statement with applicable ad valorem taxes generated through Henry County taxing authority, in conjunction with other utility services provided by the city, or any other method by which the city could bill property owners. 
                  C.  The owner of each property, building, premises, lot, or house shall be obligated to pay such sanitation service charges. Any sanitation service charge or portion of a service charge not paid when due may be recovered in an action at law or equity by the city. 
                  D.  In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by this or any other ordinance of the city, failure to pay any sanitation service charge when billed in conjunction with another utility bill may result in a discontinuance of any or all other utility services provided by the city. 
                  E.  Until such time as the city passes an ordinance or resolution amending the foregoing provisions, the city elects to bill residential customers for sanitation service charges on an annual basis beginning in November of 2009 on the ad valorem tax notices issued through the Henry County tax assessor. All other classification of customers described in Section 5.12.210(B) shall be assessed beginning in 2010 by a method authorized by the city council via adoption of a resolution or ordinance. 
                  F.  For the purposes of assessment and collection of sanitation service charges, each dwelling, unit, or improved space shall be considered a separate sanitation customer or "garbage and refuse customer" if said space is heated, has plumbing, and has an entry/exit point to the exterior of the building according to the Henry County tax records.

                  1.  The city will make a special water- meter reading at the request of the consumer for a fee as fixed from time to time by the mayor and council; provided, however, that if such special reading discloses that the meter was overread, no charge will be made. 
                  2.  Water meters will be tested at the request of the consumer upon payment to the city of the actual costs of making the test; provided, however, that if the meter is found to over-register beyond three percent (3%) of the correct volume, no charge will be made.

                  5.  Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying information; and 
                  6.  Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft.

                  G.  Connection of Building Sewer to Public Sanitary Sewer. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the Y branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is twelve inches (12″) in diameter or less and no properly located Y branch is available, the city shall install a Y branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the water authority. Where the public sewer is greater than twelve inches (12″) in diameter and no properly located Y is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building sewer, which shall enter in the downstream direction at an angle of about forty-five degrees (45°). A forty-five degree (45°) ell ("L") may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the water authority. 
                  H.  Connection of Sources of Surface Water Runoff to Public Sanitary Sewer. No person shall cause the connection of down- spouts, exterior foundation drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer which is in turn connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.

In other than occupancies in groups R-2, R-3, and I-1, the construction documents shall designate the number of occupants to be accommodated on every floor, and in all rooms and spaces. 
                  h.  Construction documents for all buildings shall describe the exterior wall envelope in sufficient detail to determine compliance with the adopted codes. The construction documents shall provide details of the exterior wall envelope as required, including flashing, intersections with dissimilar materials, corners, end details, control joints, intersections at roof, eaves or parapets, means of drainage, water-resistive membrane and details around openings. The construction documents shall include manufacturer's installation instructions that provide supporting documentation that the proposed penetration and opening details described in the construction documents maintain the weather resistance of the exterior wall envelope. The supporting documentation shall fully describe the exterior wall system which was tested, where applicable, as well as the test procedure used. 
                  i.  The construction documents submitted with the application for permit shall be accompanied by a site plan showing to scale the size and location of new construction and existing structures on the site, distances from lot lines, the established street grades and the proposed finished grades and, as applicable, flood hazard areas, floodways, and design flood elevations; and it shall be drawn in accordance with an accurate boundary line survey. In the case of demolition, the site plan shall show construction to be demolished and the location and size of existing structures and construction that are to remain on the site or plot. The building official is authorized to waive or modify the requirement for a site plan when the application for permit is for alteration or repair or when otherwise warranted. The building safety division may require a boundary line survey prepared by a licensed surveyor. 
                  j.  Where design flood elevations are not specified, they shall be established in accordance with the adopted codes. 
                  C.  Examination of Documents. 
                  1.  The community development department shall examine or cause to be examined each application for a permit and the accompanying documents, consisting of drawings, specifications, computations and additional data, and shall ascertain by such examinations whether the construction indicated and described is in accordance with the requirements of the construction codes and all other pertinent laws or ordinances. 
                  2.  No reviews by department staff shall be commenced without the required fees being paid. 
                  3.  The community development department may accept a sworn affidavit from a registered architect or engineer stating that the plans submitted conform to the construction codes. For buildings and structures, the affidavit shall state that the plans conform to the laws as to egress, type of construction and general arrangement and if accompanied by drawings showing the structural design, and by a statement that the plans and design conform to the requirements of the construction codes as to strength, stresses, strains, loads and stability. The community development department may, without any examination or inspection, accept such affidavit, provided the architect or engineer who made such affidavit agrees to submit to the building official, copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed and upon completion of the structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems a certification that the structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system has been erected in accordance with the requirements of the construction codes. Where the community development department relies upon such affidavit, the architect or engineer shall assume full responsibility for the compliance with the provisions of the construction codes and other pertinent laws or ordinances. 
                  4.  This city shall not require changes in the construction documents, construction or designated occupancy of a structure for which a lawful permit has been heretofore issued or otherwise lawfully authorized, and the construction of which has been pursued in good faith within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of this Code and has not been abandoned. 
                  5.  The building official is authorized to issue a permit for the construction of foundations or any other part of a building or structure before the construction documents for the whole building or structure have been submitted, provided that adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with pertinent requirements of this Code. The holder of such permit for the foundation or other parts of a building or structure shall proceed at the holder's own risk with the building operation and without assurance that a permit for the entire structure will be granted. 
                  6.  When it is required that documents be prepared by a registered design professional, the building official shall be authorized to require the owner to engage and designate on the building permit application a registered design professional who shall act as the registered design professional in responsible charge. If the circumstances require, the owner shall designate a substitute registered design professional in responsible charge who shall perform the duties required of the original registered design professional in responsible charge. The building official shall be notified in writing by the owner if the registered design professional in responsible charge is changed or is unable to continue to perform the duties. The registered design professional in responsible charge shall be responsible for reviewing and coordinating submittal documents prepared by others, including phased and deferred submittal items, for compatibility with the design of the building. 
                  7.  For the purposes of this section, deferred submittals are defined as those portions of the design that are not submitted at the time of the application and that are to be submitted to the building official within a specified period. 
                  8.  Deferral of any submittal items shall have the prior approval of the building official. The registered design professional in responsible charge shall list the deferred submittals on the construction documents for review by the building official. 
                  9.  Documents for deferred submittal items shall be submitted to the registered design professional in responsible charge who shall review them and forward them to the building official with a notation indicating that the deferred submittal documents have been reviewed and found to be in general conformance to the design of the building. The deferred submittal items shall not be installed until the deferred submittal documents have been approved by the building official. 
                  10.  Work shall be installed in accordance with the approved construction documents, and any changes made during construction that are not in compliance with the approved construction documents shall be resubmitted for approval as an amended set of construction documents. 
                  11.  One (1) set of approved construction documents shall be retained by the building official for a period of not less than one hundred eighty (180) days from date of completion of the permitted work, or as required by state or local laws. 
                  12.  When the building official issues a permit, the construction documents shall be approved, in writing or by stamp, as "Reviewed for Code Compliance." One (1) set of construction documents so reviewed shall be retained by the building official. The other set shall be returned to the applicant, shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or a duly authorized representative. 
                  D.—L.  Reserved. 
                  M.  Issuing of Permits. 
                  1.  The department shall act upon an application for a permit without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. If the department is satisfied that the work described in an application for permit and the contract documents filed therewith conform to the requirements of the construction codes and other pertinent laws and ordinances, it shall issue a permit to the applicant. 
                  2.  If the application for a permit and the accompanying contract documents describing the work do not conform to the requirements of the construction codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the building safety division will not issue a permit, but shall return the contract documents to the applicant with the refusal to issue such permit. Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. 
                  3.  It shall be the duty of every contractor who shall make contracts for the installation or repairs of buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, sprinkler or plumbing systems, for which a permit is required, to comply with state and local rules and regulations concerning licenses which the applicable governing authority may have adopted. In such case that the state requires a contractor to have obtained a state license before they are permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the local government with a copy of their state license before receiving a permit for work to be performed. 
                  N.  Conditions of Permit. 
                  1.  A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the community development department from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the last scheduled and passed inspection. One (1) or more extensions of time, for periods not more than thirty (30) days each, may be granted by the building official. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions, if granted, shall be in writing. 
                  2.  Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the city, are hazardous or complex, the community development department shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed and, upon completion, make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official. 
                  3.  When the city issues a permit, it shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "Reviewed for Code Compliance." The community development department shall retain one (1) set of drawings so reviewed and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. 
                  4.  The permitted drawings, associated inspection reports, and all other written communication shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the city. 
                  5.  The building permit or permit card shall be kept at the site, protected from the weather and visible to the right-of-way. 
                  O.  Fees. 
                  1.  A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed by the governing body have been paid. No amendment to a permit shall be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical or gas systems, etc., has been paid. 
                  2.  Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing, etc., system before obtaining the necessary permits, shall be subject to penalty fees in accordance with the fee schedules as set by the mayor/council. 
                  3.  All work commenced without permits shall be subject to removal at the expense of the property owner. 
                  4.  On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit shall be paid as required at the time of filing application, in accordance with the fee schedules as set by the governing body.

                  c.  That granting the appeal requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the construction codes to other buildings, structures or service system; 
                  d.  That the appeal granted is the minimum that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system; 
                  e.  That the grant of the appeal will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare; 
                  f.  In granting the appeal, the mayor/council may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the mayor/council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the codes. Violation of the conditions of an appeal shall be deemed a violation of the codes. 
                  E.  Notice of appeal of decisions of the community development department shall be in writing and filed within twenty (20) calendar days after the department renders its decision. Appeals shall be in a form acceptable to the community development department.

                  This article shall be known as the "Vacant and Foreclosed Property Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. No. 17-444, § 1(Exh. A), 10-24-2017) 
                  8.08.081 - Findings and intent. 
                  A.  This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety. 
                  B.  The governing authority finds that within the city limits, there are buildings and structures that are vacant and pose a danger to the citizens of the city. Vacant structures are vulnerable to break-ins, criminal activity, destruction, fire, accidents, looting and other unsafe activities that are injurious to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. In addition, they can attract and/or cause blight and other harmful effects to surrounding properties. 
                  C.  The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property registry as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners. 
                  D.  Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted. 
                  E.  Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article. 
                  F.  This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of this Code.

                  a.  Each permit shall have a set commencement and expiration date based on information provided in the applicant's permit application.

If the utility fails to cure a default as described in the foregoing subsection within twenty (20) calendar days after such notice of default has been provided to the utility by the city, then such default shall be a material breach and the city may exercise any remedies or rights it has a law or in equity to terminate the permit.

Such standards shall be updated from time to time by the city manager who will forward a copy of same to the county licensing department of Henry County. 
                  C.  Minimum Interference. 
                  1.  All transmission and distribution structures, pipes, mains, conduits, cables, wires poles, towers, traffic and other signals, lines and equipment erected within the city shall be located so as to cause minimum interference with the proper use of the streets and to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of such streets. 
                  2.  Unless specifically authorized in the permit, no utility may occupy the city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the city from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way or the right-of-way itself. 
                  D.  Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time by the city during the term of the permit and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own expense and upon the request of the city, so long as provided a minimum of ten (10) business days' notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration or relocation.

                  F.  Tree Trimming. A utility shall have the authority to trim trees overhanging the city streets so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming into contact with the utility's facilities. All such trimming shall be done under the supervision and direction of the city and at the utility's expense.

                  A.  Installation of Poles and Other Wireholding Structures and Relocation. 
                  1.  Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby, as further described in subsection B below. The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners. 
                  2.  A utility shall not erect any poles or facilities within the streets of the city if other such poles or facilities already exist and are available to the utility under the terms of any applicable pole use agreements or service agreements, unless the utility can demonstrate a substantial economic or customer service justification for the construction of duplicative facilities. 
                  B.  Notice to Remove. 
                  1.  When the governing authority of the city shall reasonably determine that any facility of any utility, in, on, along, over, or under the public streets of the city should be removed or relocated, because it has become an obstruction or interference with the use and operation of a city street or will become an obstruction or interference with the use and safe operation of a city street which the governing authority has undertaken to improve or intends to improve, a written notice shall be directed to the utility, giving at least thirty (30) days' notice in which to make such change as is necessary for the removal or relocation as may be necessary. 
                  2.  Utility's Duties in Response to Notice to Remove. The removal or relocation shall be at the expense of the utility. If the utility does not thereafter begin removal within a reasonable time sufficient to allow for engineering and other procedures reasonably necessary to the removal and relocation of the utility facility, the city may give the utility a final notice directing that such removal shall commence not later than ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of such final notice. If such utility does not, within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such final notice, begin to remove or relocate the facility, or, having so begun removal or relocation, thereafter fails to complete the removal or relocation within a reasonable time, the city may direct that its personnel remove or relocate the same or by employing or contracting for the necessary engineering, labor, tools, equipment, supervision, or other necessary services or materials and whatever else is necessary to accomplish the removal or relocation of said facility; and the expenses thereof shall be charged to said utility. Such expense shall be certified to the city attorney, who shall have the authority to proceed with suit against the utility for same if payment or arrangements to make payment are not made within sixty (60) calendar days after notice to the utility of the expenses incurred by the city therefore.

                  1.  A utility shall replace and restore such city street and/or right-of-way to a condition as good as or better than that which existed before the utility's work was begun; provided, however, that where a cut disturbance is made in a section of sidewalk paving, the utility shall replace the full width of the existing walk and length of section cut, as such section is marked by expansion joints or scoring. 
                  2.  The utility shall maintain in good condition, for a period of one (1) year following such disturbance, all portions of a sidewalk or street repair it has completed, provided the maintenance or repair is made necessary due to the defective workmanship or materials supplied by the grantee.

               <head>Chapter 8.12 - SIGN REGULATIONS </head>
               <p>
                  8.12.010 - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is set forth as follows herein: 
                  (a)  A comprehensive sign regulation is necessary because of the current burgeoning growth in Stockbridge and Henry County in general and because two (2) major interstate highways run through the city and attract signs that are unrelated to business uses inside the city, leading to poor aesthetics and dropping property values. 
                  (b)  To prevent the further deterioration of the city and to ensure that it remains an attractive residential area as well as a viable commercial area, it is necessary to maintain a visually satisfying environment. A plethora of signs of a certain size and nature, no matter how tasteful, can have an undesirable effect upon traffic safety and the well-being of the entire community. The city is more likely to attract commercial enterprises and permanent residents if it improves and maintains its appearance. City residents will ultimately benefit from enhanced retail and commercial environments and improvements in the quality of life as a result of these regulations. It is a rational desire of the community, and most specifically of those who live therein from day to day, to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized. 
                  (c)  Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and sustain stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and to encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings and other structures throughout the city. 
                  (d)  Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city council hereby imposes the sign regulations contained in this article. 
                  (e)  The city council finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals and entities may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The city council intends by enacting this chapter to: 
                  (1)  Balance the rights of individuals and entities to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  (2)  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and the aesthetics of the city; 
                  (3)  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
                  (4)  Maintain the historical image of the city; 
                  (5)  Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  (6)  Promote economic development; and 
                  (7)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

                  (4)  External illumination. Signs externally illuminated shall be lighted so that no lights are positioned in such a manner that light glares or shines into the eyes of motorists or pedestrians so as to create a hazardous or dangerous condition. 
                  (d)  Construction near or on a lot containing an existing billboard, pylon, or off premises sign. 
                  (1)  Construction of any structure, building, or appurtenance adjacent to, or on a lot containing an interstate sign, pylon or ground sign under the standards of this provision shall require that: 
                  a.  No buildings, structures, or appurtenances may be constructed within the "fall zone" of such sign. A "fall zone" is defined as an area equal to one hundred thirty-three percent (133%) of the height of the sign in every direction. 
                  b.  No subdivision of a parcel containing a billboard shall be permitted unless the subdivided lot containing the billboard is large enough to encompass the "fall zone" of such billboard. 
                  (2)  Construction of any interstate sign, pylon or ground sign on a lot containing any structure, building or appurtenance under the standards of this provision shall require that: 
                  a.  No sign may be constructed where a building, structure or appurtenance will be located within the "fall zone" of the sign. A "fall zone" is defined as an area equal to one hundred thirty-three percent (133%) of the height of the sign in every direction. 
                  b.  No subdivision of a parcel containing an interstate sign, pylon or ground sign shall be permitted unless the subdivided lot containing the sign is large enough to encompass the "fall zone" of such sign.

                  (Ord. 03-78 § 1, 2003; Ord. 02-46 § 2 (part), 2002; Ord. No. 13-335, § 1, 11-11-2013) 
                  8.12.045 - Sign measurement. 
                  (a)  Area. The area of a sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest continuous polygon comprised of not more than eight (8) straight lines enclosing the limits of a sign face, together with any sign face cabinet or frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face used to differentiate the sign area from the structure upon which it is placed. If polygons established around wall signs located on the same street oriented wall are within twenty-four (24) inches or less of one another, then the area of the sign shall be measured within one (1) continuous polygon. 
                  (b)  Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction; or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, beaming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoned lot, whichever is greater (surveyor's certificate required). Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height limitations are applied (surveyor's certificate required). At no time shall any sign's overall height exceed the zoning district's height limitations. Any portion of such wall or other decorative structure that is discernibly devoted to the support of the sign or, by its design or architectural treatment, intended to provide a background or frame for the sign shall be included when computing sign height. 
                  (c)  Structure. The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those parts contained within the polygon that delineates the sign face. 
                  (d)  Multi-faced signs. For multi-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel and are back to back, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is 45 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs, the area of the sign shall be the total area on all sides that can be viewed at one time from any angle. 
                  (e)  Sign area examples:

                  (b)  Obstruction to doors, windows, or fire escapes. No sign shall be erected, relocated, or maintained so as to prevent free ingress to, or egress from, any door, window, or fire escape; nor shall any sign be attached to any stand pipe or fire escape. 
                  (c)  All signs located adjacent to a walkway shall be placed so that the bottom of the sign is at least eight (8) feet above the walkway on private property over which it is erected, and no sign shall extend nearer than one (1) foot from the curb line. 
                  (d)  Sign not to constitute traffic hazard. No sign or other structure regulated by this article shall be erected at the intersection of any streets in such a manner as to obstruct free and clear vision from vehicles thereupon; or be placed at any location where, by reason of the position, shape, or color, it may interfere with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with, any authorized traffic sign, signal, or device; or make use of the words "STOP," "DANGER," or any other word, phrase, symbol, or character in such manner as to interfere with, mislead, or confuse motorists. 
                  (e)  Posting on trees, poles, etc. No sign shall be allowed to be tacked, painted, posted, marked, or otherwise affixed on trees, utility poles, or other similar structures, or on rocks, the ground itself, or other natural features. 
                  (f)  No posting on supports. No message or advertisement may be displayed on any portion of the structural supports of any sign. 
                  (g)  Maintenance. All signs regulated by this article shall be kept clean, neatly painted, and free from all electrical and mechanical hazards, including, but not limited to, faulty wiring and loose connections, and the premises surrounding the signs shall be maintained by the owner in a sanitary and inoffensive condition, free and clear of all weeds, rubbish, and debris. 
                  (h)  Special situations. Those developments which include at least one (1) building of three (3) stories or more may be permitted wall signs in sizes not exceeding one hundred (100) square feet per primary and secondary facade. The sign allowance provided under this subsection shall be exempt from the aggregate signage allowed per lot. 
                  (i)  No simulation of public signal. No sign shall be erected which simulates an official traffic control device, warning sign, or public service signal. 
                  (j)  Signs during construction. One (1) temporary construction sign shall be allowed on the lot during construction or renovation. The sign shall not be internally illuminated. The sign shall not exceed twenty (20) square feet in area and five (5) feet in height, and shall be allowed beginning with the commencement of construction and ending with the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or installation of a permanent sign, whichever occurs first. The sign shall be removed if construction discontinues for more than sixty (60) days.

For developments that contain multiple addresses and/or building numbers, the range of addresses and/or building numbers shall be on the face of the monument. The numbers shall be six (6) inches in height and the color shall contrast with the sign faces so as to be readily identifiable. 
                  (d)  Projecting signs. 
                  (1)  No projecting sign may be placed over streets, alleys, or ways available for vehicular traffic, or extend into the public right-of-way.

                  2.  Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least twenty-five (25) feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in subsection (B)(1) of this section; 
                  3.  Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time the ordinance codified in this chapter takes effect or approved under the terms of this chapter; 
                  4.  Within an easement of any utility existing at the time the ordinance codified in this chapter takes effect or approved under the terms of this chapter, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures; 
                  5.  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the Henry County Planning Department Director on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten (10) days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the Henry County Planning Department Director to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area; 
                  6.  Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three (3) years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer. 
                  After the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, it shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities. 
                  Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to Section 8.18.050(B) of this chapter.

                  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter prevent land development unless a buffer variance is granted; 
                  b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in this chapter would create an extreme hardship; Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  3.  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
                  a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;

                  g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
                  h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
                  4.  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
                  a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
                  c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
                  d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
                  e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and

                  3.  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
                  4.  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one (1) acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one (1) acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least fifty (50) horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least fifty (50) horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than twenty-five (25) feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least twenty-five (25) horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority;

                  8.20.030 - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  A.  General Provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections B and C. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
                  B.  Minimum Requirements/BMPs. 
                  1.  Best management practices as set forth in subsections B and C shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph 2 of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6. 
                  2.  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
                  3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  4.  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  5.  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections C.15, 16 and 17, in light of subsection (c) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6. 
                  C.  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  1.  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  2.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  11.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  13.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  14.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 8.20.030B.2; 
                  15.  Except as provided in paragraphs 16 and 17 of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  16.  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  17.  There is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a twenty-five-foot buffer would consume at least eighteen (18) percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than five hundred (500) square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in EPD Rule 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than five thousand (5,000) square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
                  D.  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections B and C of this section. 
                  E.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 17-448, § 1(Exh. A), 11-28-2017) 
                  8.20.040 - Application/permit process. 
                  A.  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  B.  Application Requirements. 
                  1.  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  2.  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection C of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 8.20.030.B and C of this chapter will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five (5) copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  3.  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  4.  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 8.20.030.C.15, 16 and 17 have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 8.20.040.B.6., have been obtained.

                  8.20.050 - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  A.  The city will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
                  B.  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  C.  The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  D.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  E.  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  F.  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

               <p>                  Sections: 

                  8.24.010 - General provisions. 
                  A.  Findings of Fact. 
                  1.  It is hereby determined that: 
                  a.  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  b.  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  c.  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  d.  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  e.  Localities in the state of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; and 
                  f.  Therefore, the city of Stockbridge has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  B.  Purpose and Intent. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  1.  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  2.  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  3.  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  4.  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  5.  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  6.  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained and pose no threat to public safety; and, 
                  7.  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  8.24.110 - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter: 
                  A.  Water Quality. 
                  All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  1.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  2.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and, 
                  3.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city and/or its designee are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  B.  Stream Channel Protection. 
                  1.  Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three (3) approaches: 
                  a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  b.  Twenty-four (24) hour extended detention storage of the one (1) year, twenty-four (24) hour return frequency storm event; and 
                  c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  2.  This requirement is waived for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands or lakes, or to a man-made channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream streambank or channel integrity. 
                  C.  Overbank Flooding Protection. 
                  1.  Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the twenty-five (25) year, twenty-four (24) hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one (1) year, twenty-four (24) hour storm under subsection B of this section is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two (2) year through the twenty-five (25) year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  2.  This requirement is waived for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow down-stream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
                  D.  Extreme Flooding Protection. 
                  1.  Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the one hundred (100) year, twenty-four (24) hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  2.  This requirement may be adjusted or waived for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
                  E.  Structural Stormwater Controls. 
                  All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews or ether means and receive approval from the city and/or its designee before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city and/or its designee may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  F.  Stormwater Credits for Nonstructural Measures. 
                  The use of one (1) or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection A of this section. The applicant may, if approved by the city and/or its designee, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  G.  Drainage System Guidelines. 
                  Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public rights-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one (1) parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
                  1.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
                  2.  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and, 
                  3.  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  H.  Dam Design Guidelines. 
                  Any land-disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.

                  8.24.120 - Modifications for off-site facilities. 
                  A.  The stormwater management plan for each land development project shall provide for stormwater management measures located on the site of the project, unless provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site or regional facility. The off-site or regional facility must be located on property legally dedicated for the purpose, must be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater quantity and quality control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there must be a legally-obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the off-site or regional stormwater facility. In addition, on site measures shall be implemented, where necessary, to protect upstream and downstream properties and drainage channels from the site to the off-site facility. 
                  B.  A stormwater management plan must be submitted to the city and/or its designee which shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional facility. 
                  C.  To be eligible for a modification, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city and/or its designee that the use of an off-site or regional facility will not result in the following impacts to upstream or downstream areas: 
                  1.  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life and property; 
                  2.  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams and other structures; 
                  3.  Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation;

                  A.  Construction Not Subject to Impact Fees. 
                  1.  The following projects and construction activities do not constitute "development" as defined in this chapter, and are therefore not subject to the imposition of impact fees: 
                  a.  Rebuilding no more than the same number of units of development (as defined in this chapter) that were removed by demolition, or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe, on the same lot or property. 
                  b.  Remodeling or repairing a structure that does not result in an increase in the number of units of development. 
                  c.  Replacing a residential housing unit with another housing unit on the same lot or property. 
                  d.  Placing or replacing a manufactured home in a manufactured home park on a prepared manufactured home pad in existence and operation prior to the effective date of this chapter. 
                  e.  Placing a temporary construction or sales office on a lot during the period of construction or build-out of a development project. 
                  f.  Constructing an addition to or expansion of a residential dwelling unit that may increase the floor area or number of rooms but does not increase the number of housing units. 
                  g.  Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses and intended for the personal use of the residents, such as a deck or patio, detached garage or utility shed, satellite antenna, pet enclosure, or private recreational facilities such as a swimming pool or tennis court. 
                  2.  A person claiming to be not subject to impact fees under subsection A.1. of this section, above, shall submit to the administrator information and documentation sufficient to permit the administrator to determine whether such claim is correct. 
                  B.  Grandfathered Projects. 
                  1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, that portion of a project for which a valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall not be subject to development impact fees so long as the permit remains valid and construction is commenced and is pursued according to the terms of the permit. 
                  2.  Any building for which a valid and complete application for a building permit has been received prior to the effective date of this chapter may proceed without payment of fees otherwise imposed by this chapter, provided that: 
                  a.  All fees and development exactions in effect prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be or have been paid in full; and 
                  b.  Said construction shall be commenced, pursued and completed within the time established by the building permit, or within one hundred eighty (180) days, whichever is later. 
                  C.  Method of Calculation. 
                  1.  Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this chapter shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development. 
                  2.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, the calculation of impact fees shall be net of credits for the present value of ad valorem taxes or other revenues as established in the capital improvements element, and which: 
                  a.  Are reasonably expected to be generated by new growth and development; and 
                  b.  Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category for which an impact fee is imposed. 
                  3.  The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this chapter shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of the city, and may be amended from time to time by official act. 
                  4.  In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities, as established in the capital improvements element. 
                  5.  Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the capital improvements element. 
                  D.  Service Areas. The city limits of the City of Stockbridge, Georgia, constitute a single service area for all public facilities subject to impact fees under this chapter. 
                  (Ord. No. 19-480, 1(Exh. A), 3-11-2019) 
                  8.25.050 - Fee assessment and payment. 
                  A.  Fee Schedule. 
                  1.  Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the fee schedule adopted by resolution of the city council, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by the city, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
                  2.  When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two (2) or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two (2) or more uses within a building or structure other than a shopping center, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. Shopping centers shall be assessed a single impact fee, in accordance with the fee schedule on file with the office of the city clerk, as a single use without regard to its individual tenants. 
                  3.  In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then: 
                  a.  The administrator in his or her reasonable discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use category and the appropriate development impact fee. 
                  b.  In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the land use categories shown on the adopted fee schedule. 
                  c.  If the land use of the proposed development is not similar to a land use category shown on the adopted fee schedule, then an appropriate fee may be determined by the administrator as an individual assessment in accordance with the individual assessment determinations section of this chapter. 
                  d.  Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this chapter. 
                  B.  Timing of Assessment and Payment. 
                  1.  Development impact fees shall be assessed at the time of application for a building permit. 
                  2.  All development impact fees shall be collected no earlier than at the time of issuance of a building permit, and no later than as a prerequisite to issuance of an interior finishes permit or a certificate of occupancy for the building or building shell. 
                  3.  For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property, whichever is earliest. 
                  4.  If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the following: 
                  a.  Prior to the completion of the project, and as a condition to the issuance of an interior finishes permit or a certificate of occupancy, as applicable, the developer shall recertify in writing to the administrator the actual land use or uses of the project, and shall present an architect's certificate of the actual gross square footage of floor area attributable to each use. 
                  b.  In the event that the actual land use or uses and/or the actual gross square footage applicable to the actual land use or uses differs from that originally certified, and in the event that the impact fee applicable to the actual land use or uses and/or gross square footage exceeds the impact fee previously paid, the developer shall be required to pay the amount of the excess as a condition to the issuance of an interior finishes permit or a certificate of occupancy. 
                  c.  The amount of the excess shall be based upon the impact fee schedule in effect on the date the interior finishes permit or the certificate of occupancy is issued. 
                  d.  If the actual gross square footage constructed after the issuance of the building permit is less than the amount originally certified, the developer shall be entitled to a refund of the excess portion of the fee in accordance with this chapter. 
                  5.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the original building permit shall result in the assessment of such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the original building permit. 
                  C.  Individual Assessment Determinations. An individual assessment of development impact fees for a particular property or proposed use may be established as follows: 
                  1.  At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project in lieu of the fee established on the fee schedule on file in the city clerk's office. 
                  2.  In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. The individual assessment study shall: 
                  a.  Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data; or 
                  b.  Be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in the city or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to accepted methodology. 
                  3.  The applicant shall provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination. 
                  4.  The administrator in his or her reasonable discretion shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this chapter. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this chapter. 
                  5.  Any fee approved as an individual assessment determination shall have standing for one hundred eighty (180) days following the date of approval. Payment of such an approved individual assessment determination shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by the city, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
                  D.  Fee Certification. Upon application to the administrator, a property owner or developer may receive a certification of the development impact fee schedule on file in the city clerk's office or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable. 
                  1.  The administrator shall provide an applicant with a written certification of the impact fee schedule within five (5) working days after the administrator's receipt of a completed application. The fee schedule certified by the administrator shall establish the impact fee schedule for the proposed development activity for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of certification. 
                  2.  The administrator shall provide the applicant with a written certification of an individual fee determination within thirty (30) days after receipt of a completed application. The individual fee determination certified by the administrator shall establish the total impact fee for the proposed development activity for the 180-day period immediately following the date of such certification. 
                  3.  Notwithstanding the issuance of any certification of an individual fee determination, any additions to the proposed development activity different from the development activity identified in the original application shall negate any such certification.

                  A.  Exemption Policy. The city council recognizes that some development projects may provide extraordinary benefit in support of the economic and employment advancement of the city and the city's citizens over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general. To encourage such development projects, the mayor and city council may consider granting a reduction in the impact fee for such a development project upon the determination and relative to the extent that the development project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the city, in accordance with exemption criteria as adopted herein.

                  2.  A building permit may be issued upon approval of an exemption, or may be issued without payment of applicable impact fees following receipt of a complete exemption application and pending its approval, but a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until a decision regarding the exemption has been made, or until such time that the application for exemption is otherwise withdrawn by the applicant and payment of impact fees has been made. 
                  3.  Documentation must be provided to the administrator that demonstrates the applicant's eligibility for an exemption. This documentation shall address, but need not be limited to, all applicable exemption criteria adopted herein. 
                  4.  The administrator in his or her reasonable discretion shall determine whether an application for exemption addresses the exemption criteria adopted by the city and is complete.

                  D.  Reimbursement to Impact Fee Fund. It is recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees. As part of the annual budgeting process, adequate funds shall be identified and transferred to the impact fee fund accounts equal to the amount of all exemptions granted by the city council during the preceding year.

                  b.  Separate accounting records shall be maintained for each category of system improvements (fire protection, law enforcement, parks and recreation, and road improvements) and for administration fees collected. 
                  c.  Interest earned on development impact fees shall be allocated to each category of system improvements and the administration accounts in proportion to the impact fees collected, shall be considered funds of the account on which it is earned and shall be subject to all restrictions placed on the use of development impact fees under this chapter. 
                  2.  Expenditures; Restrictions. 
                  a.  Expenditures from the system improvements impact fee accounts shall be made only for the category of system improvements for which the development impact fee was assessed and collected. 
                  b.  Expenditures from the administration account may be expended directly for administrative purposes or transferred to the general fund to cover administrative costs. 
                  c.  Except as provided below, development impact fees shall not be expended for any purpose that does not involve building or expanding system improvements that create additional capacity available to serve new growth and development. 
                  d.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, the following shall be considered general revenue of the city, and may be expended accordingly:

                  8.25.080 - Credits. 
                  When eligible, feepayors shall be entitled to a credit against impact fees otherwise due and owing under the circumstances and in the manner set forth in this section. 
                  1.  Credits; Restrictions. 
                  a.  Except as provided in the following paragraph b., no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this chapter. 
                  b.  If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) prior to the effective date of this chapter for system improvements that are included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element, is greater than the impact fee that would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, any credit due under this section shall not constitute a liability of the city, and shall accrue to the developer to the extent of impact fees assessed for new development for the same category of system improvements. 
                  c.  In no event shall credit be given for project improvements as defined in this chapter. 
                  2.  Granting of Credits. 
                  a.  Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that: 
                  i.  The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element; 
                  ii.  The amount of the credit does not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding, as shown in the capital improvements element; and 
                  iii.  The city council shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction, dedication, or transfer. 
                  b.  The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the impact fee due for any particular public facilities category for which a development impact fee is imposed, unless a greater credit is authorized under a private contractual agreement executed under the provisions of this chapter. 
                  i.  Any credit amount in excess of the impact fee due for any particular public facilities category may be carried over and applied to the impact fee due in the same public facilities category for another development by the developer, or to a successor in interest, within the city. 
                  ii.  To qualify as a "successor in interest" for entitlement to a credit, notice must have been given to the administrator of a legal transfer or assignment of the right of entitlement to the credit, including the name, mailing address and written, notarized authorization of the grantor and the name and mailing address of the grantee. 
                  3.  Guidelines for Credit Valuation. Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines: 
                  a.  For the construction of any system improvements by a developer (as defined in this chapter) or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated. 
                  b.  For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated. 
                  c.  For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that the city would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less. 
                  d.  For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest accepted by the city, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated. 
                  e.  In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the interest rate being earned on the city's impact fee funds, and the average annual inflation rate shall be that for the Consumer Price Index (the CPI) for the cost of money, or the average rate reported by the Engineering News Record for construction in general (the CCI) or building construction specifically (the BCI), as appropriate. 
                  4.  Credits; Application. 
                  a.  Credits shall be given only upon written application of the developer to the administrator. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment. 
                  b.  The administrator, in his or her reasonable discretion, shall review all applications for credits and make determinations regarding the allowance of any claimed credit, and the value of any allowed credit. 
                  c.  Any credit approved by the administrator shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment. 
                  d.  Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this chapter. 
                  5.  Credits; Abandoned Building Permits. 
                  a.  In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the impact fee against future impact fees for the same parcel of land. 
                  b.  A building permit shall be deemed abandoned if no construction has been commenced prior to the expiration of the building permit.

                  1.  Upon the written request of a feepayor regarding a property on which a development impact fee has been paid, the development impact fee shall be refunded if: 
                  a.  Capacity is available in the public facilities for which the fee was collected but service is permanently denied; or 
                  b.  The development impact fee has not been encumbered or construction has not been commenced within six (6) years after the date the fee was collected. 
                  2.  In determining whether development impact fees have been encumbered, development impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. 
                  B.  Notice of Entitlement to a Refund. When the right to a refund exists due to a failure to spend or encumber the development impact fees, the administrator shall provide written notice of entitlement to a refund to the feepayor who paid the development impact fee at the address shown on the application for development approval or to a successor in interest who has given adequate notice to the administrator of a legal transfer or assignment of the right to entitlement to a refund and who has provided a mailing address. Such notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the six-year period after the date that the development impact fee was collected and shall contain a heading "Notice of Entitlement to Development Impact Fee Refund." No refund shall be made for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of said publication. 
                  C.  Filing a Request for a Refund. A request for a refund shall be made in writing to the administrator within one (1) year of the time the refund becomes payable or within one (1) year of publication of the notice of entitlement to a refund, whichever is later. Failure to make a claim for a refund within said time period shall result in a waiver of all claims to said funds. 
                  D.  Payment of Refunds. 
                  1.  All refunds shall be made to the feepayor within sixty (60) days after it is determined by the administrator that a sufficient proof of claim for refund has been made, but no sooner than thirty (30) days after publication of the notice of entitlement to the refund. 
                  2.  A refund shall include a refund of a pro rata share of interest actually earned on the unused or excess impact fee collected. 
                  3.  In no event shall a feepayor be entitled to a refund for impact fees assessed and paid to recover the cost of excess capacity in existing system improvements, for any portion of an impact fee collected as a repayment for expenditures made by the city for system improvements intended to be funded by such impact fee, or for that portion of the fee payment that was assessed for administration of the impact fee ordinance or for recovery of the cost of preparation of the capital improvements element.

                  1.  The system improvements are included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element; and 
                  2.  The amount of any credit granted shall not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding. 
                  B.  Private Agreements; Provisions. A private contractual agreement for system improvements may include, but shall not be limited to, provisions that: 
                  1.  Modify the estimates of impact on public facilities according to the methods and provisions concerning the calculation of impact fees, provided that any such agreement shall allow the city to assess additional development impact fees after the completion of construction according to schedules set forth in this chapter. 
                  2.  Permit construction of, dedication of property for, or other in-kind contribution for specific public facilities of the type for which development impact fees would be imposed in lieu of or with a credit against applicable development impact fees. 
                  3.  Permit a schedule and method of payment appropriate to particular and unique circumstances of a proposed project in lieu of the requirements for payment under this chapter, provided that acceptable security is posted ensuring payment of the development impact fees. Forms of security that may be acceptable include a cash bond, irrevocable letter of credit from a bank authorized to do business within the state of Georgia, a surety bond, or lien or mortgage on lands to be covered by the building permit. 
                  C.  Private Agreements; Procedure.

                  B.  Capital Improvements Element Periodic Review. 
                  1.  Annual Update. At least once each year, the city council shall review and may update the capital improvements element so as to maintain, at a minimum, a schedule of system improvements for each of the subsequent five (5) years. The capital improvements element update may include changes in funding sources or project costs, or changes in the list or scheduling of projects. The capital improvements element update shall be submitted to the Atlanta Regional Commission for their review, in accordance with the development impact fee compliance requirements as adopted by the Board of Community Affairs of the State of Georgia. 
                  2.  Amendment. In conducting a periodic review of the capital improvements element and calculation of development impact fees, the city council may determine to amend the capital improvements element. Amendments to the capital improvements element shall comply with the procedural requirements of the development impact fee compliance requirements as adopted by the Board of Community Affairs of the State of Georgia, and shall be required for any change to the capital improvements element that would: 
                  a.  Redefine growth projections, land development assumptions, or goals or objectives that would affect system improvements proposed in the capital improvements element; 
                  b.  Add new public facility categories for impact fee funding, modify impact fee service areas or make changes to system improvement projects; 
                  c.  Change service levels established for an existing impact fee service area; or

                  C.  Continuation of Validity. Failure of the city council to undertake a periodic review of the capital improvements element shall result in the continued use and application of the latest adopted development impact fee schedule; project listings, including estimated costs and impact eligibility percentages; and data upon which the level of service standards and impact fee calculations are based. The failure to periodically review such data shall not invalidate this chapter.

                  The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the city's separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This chapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the city's separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this chapter are to: 
                  1.  Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the city's separate storm sewer system by any person; 
                  2.  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the city's separate storm sewer system; 
                  3.  Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the city's separate storm sewer system; and 
                  4.  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  B.  Applicability. 
                  The provisions of this chapter shall apply throughout the municipal boundaries of the city and to all discharges entering the city's storm drain system generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by an authorized enforcement agency.

                  B.  The person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone, facsimile or in person no later than twenty-four (24) hours of the nature, quantity and time of occurrence of the discharge. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the authorized enforcement agency within three (3) business days of the phone call or in person notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years. That person shall also take immediate steps to ensure no recurrence of the discharge or spill. 
                  C.  In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, emergency response agencies and/or other appropriate agencies shall be immediately notified. 
                  D.  Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a violation of the provisions of this chapter.

                  The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contaminations of stormwater, the storm drain system, state waters or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at the person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the city's separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

                  8.28.010 - Findings of fact. 
                  A.  The flood hazard areas of the city of Stockbridge are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  B.  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
                  C.  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can (1) protect human life and health; (2) minimize damage to private property; (3) minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  D.  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the state of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city of Stockbridge, Georgia, does ordain this chapter and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
                  (Ord. 06-153 § 2 (part), 2006) 
                  8.28.020 - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  A.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  B.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  C.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  D.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  E.  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and 
                  F.  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

The market value of the building means: (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  "Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision" is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

                  8.28.150 - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. 
                  An engineering study is required, as appropriate, to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of Section 8.28.210 of this chapter apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the state of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the department designated by the Henry County Board of Commissioners prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  A.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  B.  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology and approved by the department designated by the Henry County Board of Commissioners. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available.

                  8.28.160 - Floodway encroachments. 
                  Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  A.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection B of this section; 
                  B.  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  C.  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the department designated by the Henry County Board of Commissioners until an affirmative Conditional Letter of Map Revision ("CLOMR") is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the department designated by the Henry County Board of Commissioners.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions apply: 
                  A.  New construction of principal buildings (residential or nonresidential), including manufactured homes, shall not be allowed within the limits of the future-conditions floodplain, unless all requirements of Sections 8.28.140, 8.28.150 and 8.28.160 of this chapter have been met. 
                  B.  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
                  C.  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
                  D.  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
                  E.  Elevated Buildings. All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished and flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  1.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  a.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding, 
                  b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1′) above grade, and 
                  c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions; 
                  2.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished and flood-resistant enclosure shall solely be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  3.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  F.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located three feet (3′) above the base flood elevation or one foot (1′) above the future-conditions flood elevation, whichever is higher, so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  G.  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  H.  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
                  I.  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
                  J.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them, during flooding. 
                  K.  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  L.  If the proposed development is located in multiple flood zones or multiple base flood elevation cross the proposed site, the higher or more restrictive base flood elevation or future condition elevation and development standards shall take precedence.

                  E.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters, and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
                  F.  All subdivision proposals shall include adequate drainage and stormwater management facilities per the requirements of the city of Stockbridge to reduce potential exposure to flood hazards. 
                  (Ord. 06-153 § 2 (part), 2006) 
                  8.28.240 - Variance procedures. 
                  The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the department designated by the Henry County Board of Commissioners, or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated hereinabove. 
                  A.  Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the department designated by the Henry County Board of Commissioners. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the department designated by the Henry County Board of Commissioners. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  B.  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the department designated by the Henry County Board of Commissioners shall have the right to appeal such decision in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the Henry County Board of Commissioners. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  C.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Henry County Board of Commissioners may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Henry County, as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  D.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  E.  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  F.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  G.  In reviewing such requests, the department designated by the Henry County Board of Commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  H.  Conditions for Variances. 
                  1.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  2.  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  3.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  4.  The department designated by the Henry County Board of Commissioners shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  I.  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the department designated by the Henry County Board of Commissioners shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request. 
                  J.  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the department designated by the Henry County Board of Commissioners and the Henry County Board of Commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this chapter. 
                  K.  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

                  8.30.010 - Findings. 
                  The city council makes the following findings: 
                  A.  The professional engineering and financing analysis, known as the Stormwater Management Action Plan, prepared by Arcadis G and M, Inc., properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the city. 
                  B.  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
                  C.  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of Stockbridge. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  D.  The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of Stockbridge in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analysis. The service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and risk exposure. 
                  E.  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in Stockbridge in concert with the management of other water resources in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
                  F.  The city council finds, concludes and determines that a stormwater management utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in Stockbridge. 
                  G.  An equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges upon properties that is related to the burden of stormwater quality control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city. Such schedule of service charges can be complemented by other funding methods which address specific needs, including but not limited to, allocations of special purpose local options sales taxes to stormwater drainage improvement projects. A service charge credit is an appropriate means of adjusting service charges in recognition that private stormwater systems and/or actions can effectively reduce or eliminate the burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs that a property or properties pose for the city. Impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city, and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater service charges and associated credits. In addition, the value to the stormwater utility of certain actions and practices performed by property owners and other stormwater utility customers may be recognized by credits based on other factors, including but not limited to, the avoided cost of public information and education realized by the utility when public information and education about stormwater management is provided by the public school system.

                  8.30.020 - Establishment of a utility and enterprise fund. 
                  A.  There is hereby established a stormwater management utility within the Stockbridge utility department which shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the city's corporate limits, and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. Such utility shall be under the direction of a stormwater utility director, appointed by the city manager. 
                  B.  The city manager and city clerk shall establish a stormwater enterprise fund in the city budget and accounting system, separate and apart from its general fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees and licenses as may be established by the city council. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the stormwater enterprise fund, to be held and invested in trust for the purposes dedicated, and expended exclusively for purposes of the utility, including capital project construction. No other funds of the city shall be deposited in the stormwater enterprise fund or commingled with dedicated stormwater revenues, except that other revenues, receipts and resources not accounted for in the stormwater enterprise fund, including, but not limited to, grants, transfers of city funds, loans and bond proceeds may be combined with and applied to stormwater management capital projects as deemed appropriate by the city council, upon recommendation of the city manager. 
                  C.  The city council hereby transfers to the stormwater utility director operational control over the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and heretofore operated by the city and other related assets, including but not limited to properties upon which such facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access and certain equipment. 
                  (Ord. 04-109 § 2 (part), 2004) 
                  8.30.030 - Definitions. 
                  "Credit" means a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner, which system, facility, service or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. Credits for on-site stormwater systems shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the site. 
                  "Customers of the stormwater management utility" includes all persons, properties and entities served by and/or benefiting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension and improvement of the public stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of public and private stormwater systems, facilities and activities related thereto, and persons, properties and entities which will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the stormwater management program. 
                  "Detached dwelling unit" means developed land containing one (1) structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one (1) or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one (1) family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes and mobile homes located on one (1) or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship or similar non-residential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
                  "Developed land" means all real property altered from its natural state by grading, paving, compaction, construction of structures, impervious services or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped condition. 
                  "Duplexes and triplexes" means developed land containing two (2) (duplex) or three (3) (triplex) attached residential dwelling units located on one (1) or more parcels of land. 
                  "Equivalent runoff unit (ERU)" is defined to serve as a reference point for comparing dissimilar properties and attaining an equitable distribution of the cost of services and facilities through a stormwater management service charge. The equivalent runoff unit in Stockbridge has been determined through engineering and analysis to include two (2) primary parameters with the following metrics: (1) One (1) acre of gross area, and (2) two thousand (2,000) square feet of impervious area. These units will be used to determine and compute the service charge for all properties within the city. 
                  "Hydrologic response" of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property. 
                  "Impervious" means not allowing the passage of water through the surface on the ground or ground covering or a substantial reduction in the capacity for water to pass through the surface of the ground or ground covering as it would under natural conditions. The following types of surfaces will be considered "impervious" for purposes of the stormwater utility: the projected area of buildings; asphalt-, concrete-, brick- or stone-paved areas; improved vehicular drives and parking areas; compacted gravel and soil surfaces; fabric or plastic coverings; and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development. 
                  "Multiple dwelling unit residential properties" means developed land whereon four (4) or more attached residential dwelling units are located and shall include, but not be limited to, apartment houses, condominiums, town homes, attached single-family homes, boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, retirement centers and other structures in which four (4) or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. In the application of stormwater service charge rates, multiple dwelling unit properties shall be treated as other developed lands. 
                  "Other developed land" means, but shall not be limited to, multiple dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs and water and wastewater treatment plants. 
                  "Service charges" means the periodic rate, fee or charge applicable to a parcel of land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the city stormwater utility. Service charges are based on measurable parameters which influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat rate charges for one (1) or more classes of similarly situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on site stormwater control systems and enhanced level of stormwater services above those normally provided by the city. 
                  "Stormwater management systems" includes facilities, operations and programs that address the issues of drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds and reservoirs through improvements, maintenance, regulation and funding of plants, works, instrumentalities and properties used or useful in the collection, retention, detention and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage. 
                  "Undeveloped land" means land in its unaltered natural state or which has been notified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state. 
                  (Ord. 04-109 § 2 (part), 2004) 
                  8.30.040 - Scope of responsibility for the city stormwater system. 
                  A.  The stormwater management utility shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the corporate limits of the city government. The utility shall provide for the conservation, management, protection, control, use and enhancement of stormwater through planning, acquisition, construction, installation, management, operation, maintenance, regulation, extension and improvement of the public stormwater systems to collect, control, convey, store, detain, retain, recharge and treat stormwater and through regulation of stormwater management systems on private property. It shall be the long-term objective of the city to provide a comparable and consistent level of stormwater service to similarly situated properties throughout the service area. 
                  B.  The city stormwater system consists of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or man made, within the political boundaries of the city of Stockbridge which control and/or convey stormwater through which the city intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties. The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of this system which: (1) are located within public streets, rights-of-way and easements; (2) are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or (3) are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of systems and facilities. 
                  C.  Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the city and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, or its occupant, or the homeowner's association in the case of a development, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the state of Georgia and/or the United States of America. Where no dedication has been made and a private individual, entity or homeowner's association becomes responsible for the maintenance of a facility or pond following the expiration of the developer's four (4) year maintenance bond, an easement in favor of the city shall be required. If, at any time, a responsible party fails to maintain a stormwater facility or pond in the manner contemplated by the city in Chapter 8.24, and specifically Section 8.24.140, then the city will act to maintain the facility or pond in a manner provided for under Chapter 8.24. The private party shall remain responsible for all costs incurred for that maintenance provided by the city. For the purpose of the city's conducting such maintenance activities all final subdivision plats that contemplate stormwater facilities or ponds shall provide for, at minimum, a thirty foot (30′) gravel easement from the existing public roadway to the detention facility or pond. 
                  D.  It is the intent of the ordinance codified in this chapter to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city of Stockbridge. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity by or upon property not owned by the city, pursuant to the ordinance codified in this chapter or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shal1 not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees or agents.

                  A.  The appropriate and efficacious management of the stormwater management system by the city on behalf of all its citizens and in compliance with applicable state and federal law places necessary and appropriate obligations on private property owners as well. All property owners and developers of developed real property within the city shall provide, manage, maintain and operate on-site stormwater systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all city development regulations and the laws of the state of Georgia and the United States of America following the expiration of any existing maintenance bond by a builder or developer. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of the ordinance codified in this chapter, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance, as well as to conduct maintenance that has not been properly conducted as contemplated by the city's code. 
                  B.  Any failure to meet the obligations set forth in this chapter shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the city in the municipal court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed pursuant to the guidelines set out in the city code. 
                  C.  The property owners that are serviced by stormwater facilities and the titleholder to the property upon which the stormwater facilities are located shall be responsible for the continued maintenance and payment of all expenses incurred for the operation, maintenance and repair of facilities. 
                  (Ord. 05-134 § 1, 2005: Ord. 04-109 § 2 (part), 2004) 
                  State Law reference— Official Code of Georgia § 9-12-81(b). 
                  8.30.060 - General funding policy. 
                  A.  It shall be the policy of the city that funding for the stormwater utility is equitably derived through methods that have demonstrable relationships to the varied demands and costs imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and/or the level of service provided as a result of the provision of stormwater services and facilities. 
                  B.  Service charges for stormwater management shall be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities. The cost of stormwater services and facilities may include administrative, operating, capital investment, debt service, engineering and planning and reserve expenses, and may also include related regulatory expenses associated with watershed management requirements. Properties shall be charged rentals, rates, charges, fees or licenses in proportion to their related cost of service impact. 
                  C.  Service charge rates shall be designed to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management by the city, whether within or outside the stormwater utility, including but not limited to plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges and special assessments.

                  8.30.070 - Effective date of stormwater charges. 
                  Stormwater service charges shall accrue beginning August 1, 2004, and shall be billed periodically thereafter to customers, except as specific exemptions and credits may apply. 
                  (Ord. 04-109 § 2 (part), 2004) 
                  8.30.080 - Stormwater management utility service charges. 
                  A.  There are hereby established stormwater management utility service charges that shall be billed to all properties in the Stockbridge service area, except as specific exemptions or credits may allow for in the ordinance codified in this chapter or shall allow in future ordinances or amendments to this chapter. The stormwater management utility service charges may, but are not required to, include a service rate charge applied to each property. The service rate charge, if applied, shall be related generally to the amount and quality of runoff discharged to the public stormwater systems and stormwater receiving waters and to the costs of services associated with stormwater management. The service charge may also include a base rate charge for certain costs of service common to all stormwater management accounts, and/or special service charges to persons, entities or properties that require services and/or facilities not commonly needed by all persons, entities or properties. 
                  B.  The service rate charge, if applied, shall be reflective of the cost of providing services and facilities to properly control storm-water runoff quantity and quality. The three (3) most important factors in the city's present cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities to individual properties are: (1) the size of each property; (2) the amount of impervious area on each property; and (3) the number of parcels in the service area. 
                  C.  A base rate charge, if applied, shall be structured to recover those stormwater management costs of service that are not related to the size of individual properties or the amount of impervious area on individual properties, and may include, but are not limited to, the cost of billing and accounting for service charges to each account and other administrative and overhead expenses. 
                  D.  Special service charges, if applied, shall be structured to recover the cost of providing to certain persons, entities and properties types or levels of stormwater management services that are not commonly required by all stormwater service charge ratepayers. Such services may include, but are not limited to, private development plan review and inspection, site inspections to verify the operational condition of on-site stormwater management systems, such as private detention/retention and conveyance facilities, monitoring and mitigative activities related to conditions on individual properties that impact water quality and actions to abate conditions on private properties that do not comply with adopted city standards and/or that interfere with proper stormwater management and have been determined to constitute a public nuisance. 
                  E.  The professional engineering and management analysis conducted for the city determined that properties within the city service area classified as single-family residential property can be equitably and fairly charged based on a two-tier (2) grouping according to the number of ERU's and parcel area. This method greatly simplified the computation of charges and reduces significantly the costs associated with individually unique parcel measurements. Tier 1 properties in this class are all parcels up to ten thousand (10,000) square feet in size; Tier 2 properties are parcels greater than ten thousand (10,000) square feet in size. Tier 1 parcels are assessed one (1) ERU, and Tier 2 parcels are assessed two (2) ERU's. The mayor and city council hereby adopt these values as representative of the conditions of single-family residential property in Stockbridge. These values shall serve as the basis on which service rate charges will be calculated. Each single-family residential property shall be billed a stormwater service rate charge for the number of ERU's and the whole number of acres of parcel area. Tier 1 and Tier 2 parcels are assigned an acreage charge based on the actual acreage to the next whole integer. 
                  F.  Properties classified as nonresidential shall be billed on the basis of the number of ERU's and acres calculated to exist. Each acre or fraction thereof and ERU or fraction thereof shall be charged a service rate charge at the rate per ERU of impervious area and each acre unit as defined below. 
                  G.  The method of calculating the service rate charge for all properties shall be as follows: 
                  Parcel Fee = (IR) × (ERU' s) + (AR) × (AU) + (AF) 
                  IR is the impervious area rate as established by this chapter or by amendment to this chapter. It is applied to the number of ERU's rounded to the next whole number. An ERU is defined as two thousand (2,000) square feet of impervious area. 
                  AR is the gross area rate as established by this chapter or by amendment to this chapter. It is applied to the number of acre units (AU's) in the parcel rounded to the next whole acre. 
                  AF is the administrative cost factor established by this chapter or by amendment to this chapter. The AF is applied as a fixed uniform flat charge to each parcel. 
                  H.  The annual IR per ERU for the service rate charge applicable to each property shall be fifteen dollars and seventy cents ($15.70) unless modified to equitably account for special conditions on an individual property, adjusted for a particular property through the appeal process specified in this chapter, or changed hereafter by ordinance. 
                  I.  The annual AR per AU for the service rate charge applicable to each property shall be zero dollars ($0.00) unless modified to equitably account for special conditions on an individual property, adjusted for a particular property through the appeal process specified in this chapter, or changed hereafter by ordinance. 
                  J.  The annual base rate charge AF per ach billed account shall be three dollars and sixty-six cents ($3.66) unless changed hereafter by ordinance. 
                  (Ord. 04-109 § 2 (part), 2004) 
                  8.30.090 - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service charges. 
                  Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater utility service charges or receive a credit or offset against such service charges. No exception, credit, offset or other reduction in stormwater service charges shall be granted based on the age, tax or economic status, race or religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. A stormwater utility service charge credit technical manual will be prepared by the city's consulting engineers specifying the design and performance standards of on-site systems, facilities, activities and services which quality application of a service charge credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. This manual will be separately approved by the city council and, by reference, incorporated herein. 
                  A.  Undeveloped land as defined in this chapter shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
                  B.  Developed land other than individual detached dwelling units, including but not limited to multiple dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, public streets, roads, alleys and byways, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs and water and wastewater treatment plants may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the stormwater utility service charge credit technical manual. The stormwater service charge credit may be up to one hundred percent (100%) of the service charge applicable to a property, and shall be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services and activities provided, operated and maintained by the property owner reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. 
                  C.  Groups of detached dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association providing on-site systems, facilities, services or activities which reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the stormwater utility service charge credit technical manual. The stormwater service charge credit available to groups of detached dwelling units may be up to one hundred percent (100%) of the service charge applicable to the individual properties, and shall be proportional to the extent that on site systems, facilities, services and activities provided, operated and maintained by the homeowners association reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. 
                  D.  Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the stormwater utility service charge credit technical manual and/or upon continuing the provision of the systems, facilities, services and activities provided, operated and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. A credit may be revoked by the city at any time for noncompliance. 
                  E.  In addition to the foregoing credits based upon the design and performance of on-site systems, an educational credit shall be available to all public and private schools or school systems which agree to teach the WATER WISE program, an environmental science curriculum approved by the Georgia Department of Education, in grades one (1) through twelve (12). The educational credit may be up to fifty percent (50%) of the service charge applicable to a school property, and shall be proportional to the extent the approved curriculum is taught. Educational credits may be taken in conjunction with any other credit available under this section. The superintendent of schools shall certify annually to the stormwater utility director, before August 1, the extent to which the curriculum was taught. 
                  (Ord. 04-109 § 2 (part), 2004) 
                  8.30.100 - Stormwater service charge billing, delinquencies, collections. 
                  A.  Stormwater management utility service charges shall be billed and collected in the manner and at the interval deemed most efficient by the city, and shall be payable in accordance with the rules and regulations of the city finance department as applied generally to all bills. A stormwater service charge bill may be sent through the United States mail or by an alternate means notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due and the past due date. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records of Henry County, shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is under billed or if no bill is sent, the city may back bill for a period of up to one (1) year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency. A one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month late charge shall be billed based on the unpaid balance of any stormwater management utility service charge that becomes delinquent. 
                  B.  The stormwater service charge may be billed on a common statement and collected with other utility services through separate bills or any other method by which the city could bill property owners. 
                  C.  Any stormwater management utility service charge or portion of a service charge not paid when due may be recovered in an action at law or equity by the city. 
                  D.  In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by the ordinance codified in this chapter or any other ordinance of the city, failure to pay any utility service charge when billed in conjunction with another utility bill may result in a discontinuance of any or all other utility services provided by the city or by other with whom contractual agreements provide for discontinuance of service for nonpayment. The owner of each property, building, premises, lot or house shall be obligated to pay such fee, which shall be enforceable by the city by action at law or equity. 
                  E.  No lien shall be imposed for delinquent collections unless a judgment is first obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  F.  Suits for collection shall be commenced by the city in the county of the owner's residence; provided, however, if the owner is not a resident of this state, suit may be filed in the Superior or State Court of Henry County, Georgia. If a suit is instituted by the city for collection, the owner shall pay court costs, litigation expenses and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the city. 
                  G.  If suit is instituted for the collection of any fees due hereunder or for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, the owner shall pay the court costs, litigation expenses and reasonable attorney's fees associated therewith.

                  8.30.110 - Appeals. 
                  Any customer who believes the provisions of this chapter have been applied in error may appeal in the following manner: 
                  A.  An appeal must be filed in writing with the city stormwater utility director. In the case of service charge appeals, the appeal shall include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer containing information on the total property area, the impervious surface area and any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events. 
                  B.  Based on the information provided, a technical review shall be conducted by the stormwater utility director of the stormwater management utility and a written determination will be issued within thirty (30) days stating whether an adjustment to the service charge is appropriate and, if so, the amount of such adjustment. 
                  C.  In response to an appeal, the stormwater utility director may adjust the stormwater service charge applicable to a property in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this chapter. 
                  D.  A decision of the stormwater utility director which is adverse to an appellant may be further appealed to the city manager within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the adverse decision. Notice of the appeal shall be served on the city manager by the appellant, stating the grounds for the appeal. The city manager shall issue a written decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days. All decisions of the city manager shall be served on the appellant personally or by registered or certified mail, sent to the billing address of the appellant. 
                  E.  If the person or entity seeking adjustment or relief from the service charge desires, the decision of the city manager may be appealed in writing to the mayor and city council. Such appeals must be made within thirty (30) days of the decision of the city manager and include a written basis for the appeal. The decision of the mayor and city council shall be final. 
                  F.  This appeal process shall not interfere with the rights of the person or entity to seek judicial relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, but shall be exhausted before judicial relief is pursued. Any appeal to the Superior Court of Henry County must be filed within thirty (30) days of the decision of the mayor and city council. 
                  G.  Notices of the appeal and decisions shall be served personally or delivered by registered or certified mail to the address of record.

                  9.01.130 - Occupation taxes levied on business to be transacted during current calendar year—Filing of returns showing gross receipts during preceding calendar year. 
                  A.  With the exception of those entities who are lawyers or attorneys engaged in the practice of law, all occupation taxes levied under this chapter are levied on the amount of business to be transacted during the current calendar year. However, for convenience of both city and the taxpayer, each business subject to the occupation tax shall, on or before the dates hereinafter set forth file with the city the return hereinafter specifically provided for, showing the gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year. This return shall be used as the basis for making estimated payments on the occupation tax for the current calendar year. The actual and final amount of tax levied for business transacted in the current calendar year shall be paid in accordance with a final return to be made after the end of the year, in accordance with the procedure set forth here. 
                  B.  The person subject to said occupation tax of the current calendar year (or persons subject to occupation tax for the previous calendar year as set forth in subsection D below) shall receive a form furnished by the city, and shall return said form within thirty (30) days of receipt, a signed return setting forth the amount of gross receipts of such business for the entire preceding calendar year. This return will be used to determine the final tax for the calendar year just completed and as an estimate of the gross receipts and occupation tax for the current calendar year. 
                  C.  Where a business subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has been conducted for only a part of the preceding year, the amount of gross receipts for such part shall be reported in said return. Said return shall also show a figure putting the receipts for such part of a year on an annual basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part year bears to the whole year. Said figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business tax liability. 
                  D.  For those practitioners of professions who are lawyers or attorneys engaged in the practice of law, and who elect to pay the occupation tax as set forth in Section 9.01.030 as opposed to the method set forth in Section 9.01.090(A)(2), all occupation taxes levied under this article are levied on the amount of business which was transacted during the previous calendar year. Each person subject to the occupation tax levied in this chapter shall file with the occupation tax clerk the returns specifically provided for in this section, showing the gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year. This return shall be used as a basis for making payment of the occupation tax for the previous calendar year. Occupation taxes shall be calculated for the year ending December 31st and shall be due no later than January 15th of the following year. (Ord 05-119 § 3, 2005)

                  B.  If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this chapter, is less than the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said business based on the estimate filed by the business, the difference in said amount shall be due and payable by the taxpayer to the city on April 1st of the current year and delinquent if not paid on or before said date. 
                  C.  If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this chapter, exceeds the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said business based on the statement filed by the business, the difference in said amount shall be refunded by city to the taxpayer; or if, said business continues to be conducted in city during the current year, such difference in amount may be credited by the city on the amount of occupation tax to be paid to the city by said business for the current year.

If, after examination of the books or records it is determined that a deficiency exists as a result of improper designation of a dominant line of a business, profession or occupation, a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the deficiency and an additional interest of one percent (1%) per month of the amount of the deficiency shall be assessed.

No new occupation tax certificate or regulatory fee certificate shall be granted by the city for the operation of a business for which any part of the occupation tax or fees herein required are unpaid nor shall such certificates be issued to a person who has failed to submit adequate records for inspection as required by Section 9.01.160.

If, at any time after the entry of the nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution pays the tax in full, together with all interest penalties and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges for services and goods due the person as though the person had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

                  9.03.010 - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this ordinance is to prescribe a method by which the city can regulate sound produced at subject establishments to prevent disturbances of the public peace in nearby residential areas. Although the city zoning ordinance allows and encourages many for-profit or not-for-profit businesses, offices, organizations or institutions to conduct their operations near residential areas and the city wishes to continue to permit such uses proximate to residential areas, some of these uses have generated sound at levels beyond those tolerable to the average residents of the city. These disturbances have generated numerous complaints and forced the city to bring legal actions against offensive businesses. Therefore, it is the city's intent to regulate the time, place and manner of sound produced at or by subject establishments as defined herein through the issuance and enforcement of sound production permits. Said permits are intended to protect the public safety and welfare as well as nearby residential property values from the adverse impacts of intolerable sound emanating from subject establishments. 
                  (Ord. 03-71 § 1 (part), 2003) 
                  9.03.020 - Definitions.

                  "Maximum permitted sound level" is maximum level of sound a subject establishment may produce under this chapter. A maximum permitted sound level shall be set for sound measured using the A-weighted scale and for each designated hertz level. 
                  "Measurement marker" is a marker on the property of a subject establishment indicating the location most directly in line with the most proximate residence, residential area or hospital at which the on-site tester measured the sound emanating from a sound source of an ASPD.

                  "Off-site tester" is a tester who assists with determination of whether an establishment qualifies as a subject establishment or establishment of maximum permitted sound levels by measuring audible sound emanating from subject establishments while standing at a location designated by this chapter. 
                  "On-site tester" is a tester who assists with determination of whether an establishment qualifies as a subject establishment or establishment of maximum permitted sound levels by adjusting and measuring the sound levels of sound production devices at establishments or ASPDs at subject establishments as required by this chapter.

                  E.  At any time, the city council, by its own adopted motion, may review an application or an issued sound production permit. Should the city council desire to take action on an application or issued sound production permit, it shall do so only by majority vote at a public hearing after providing the applicant with written notice ten (10) days in advance of said hearing and the action that may be taken. The applicant may retain and be represented by legal council at said hearing. At such a hearing, the city council may revoke an issued sound production permit if it finds that the applicant provided false or misleading information in his or her application or add conditions to an issued sound production permit provided such conditions are consistent with the purposes of this chapter. An applicant or permit holder may appeal any revocation or condition imposed under this paragraph in accordance with the form of appeal provided under Section 9.03.090. 
                  F.  Sound production permits shall contain the information provided in subsections (C)(1) and (C)(2) of this section, the maximum permitted sound levels, a permit number assigned by the city clerk, and the signature of the city clerk or his or her designee.

                  H.  Sound production permits are not transferable and shall expire at eleven fifty-nine (11:59) p.m. on December 31 of the year in which they were issued. Any time a sound production permit expires without renewal, the owner or operator of a subject establishment shall reapply and conduct a new sound production test to determine the maximum permitted sound level. 
                  I.  Any permit holder seeking to renew an existing sound production permit shall submit to the city clerk a letter requesting renewal and containing any information necessary to update the original application and a new maximum permitted sound level. Hence, the owner or operator shall conduct a new sound production test to determine the maximum permitted sound level for the renewed permit. Renewal letters are due to the city clerk by December 1 of the year in which said permit was issued. The procedures and rules for determinations of completeness and issuance of sound production permits shall apply to renewals. In addition, the authority of the renewing applicant, consent given by the renewing applicant, and oaths or affirmations made by the renewing applicant in his or her original application shall likewise be renewed and continue to apply. If the renewing applicant differs from the original applicant for the same subject establishment, however, the said renewing applicant may not renew but shall submit a new application. 
                  (Ord. 03-71 § 1 (part), 2003) 
                  9.03.050 - Sound production test. 
                  A.  The maximum permitted sound levels shall be established using the following sound production test. 
                  1.  For this test, the on-site tester shall cause to be used music that produces sound that will register on both an A-weighted scale and at each designated hertz level (i.e., both treble and base sound). Also, during this test, doors and windows of the subject establishment shall be closed. 
                  2.  Initially, each sound producing device of an establishment must be tested to determine whether it qualifies as an ASPD. To make such a determination, an on-site tester will cause said device to be operated, played, or performed at its highest sound producing level. If the sound produced by said device is detected above fifty decibels (50 db) on an A-weighted scale or above any of the designated hertz levels by an off-site tester using a sound measurement device at a distance of one hundred feet (100′) from the sound source, if outside, or from the exterior of the building or structure in which a sound source is located, then it shall be deemed an amplified sound production device. 
                  3.  For each ASPD, an off-site tester shall stand outside of the nearest residence or hospital within ten feet (10′) of the exterior side which most directly faces the subject establishment while an on-site tester causes the volume of each ASPD to be increased to the point where the sound emanating from the ASPD is detectable at levels above fifty decibels (50 db) on the A-weighted scale and each of the designated hertz levels by the off-site tester. 
                  4.  At that level of volume, the on-site tester causes the volume of the ASPD to be decreased to a level where the sound is no longer detected above fifty decibels (50 db) on an A-weighted scale or any of the designated hertz levels by the off-site tester. At that level using a sound measuring device, the on-site tester shall take and record a measurement of the A-weighted scale and each designated hertz level while standing as directly in line with the off-site tester's location as is reasonably possible and twenty feet (20′) from the exterior side of the building from which the sound is emanating. If an approximate in-line location is twenty feet (20′) from the exterior side of the building is not possible and easily accessible for enforcement purposes, then the on-site tester shall record a measurement at some other location easily identifiable for enforcement purposes and as close as possible to the above prescribed location. For the said location, the tester shall cause a measurement marker to be created and a description of and map indicating the location of the measurement marker shall be provided in the application for a sound production permit. 
                  5.  Thereafter, the on-site tester shall take and record the same types of measurements twenty feet (20′) from each of the exterior sides of the building from which the sound is emanating. 
                  6.  Each measurement shall be taken for a period of one minute and during the absence of background noise. 
                  7.  A general description of each ASPD, the time, date and location of each recorded measurement along with the name and signature of the recorder shall be recorded and said record shall be attached to the affidavit described in subsection (A)(9) of this section. 
                  8.  Of all the measurements taken and recorded for each ASPD on the premises of the subject establishment, the lowest of the A-weighted scale measurements and the lowest measurement for each designated hertz level shall be the maximum permitted sound levels for the subject establishment when measured at the measurement marker. 
                  9.  The off-site and on-site testers shall execute an affidavit stating their company or partnership name; individual names, initials, titles, if any, and contact information; the maximum permitted sound level determined; the serial number, maker, name and type of sound measurement device used; a statement that the sound measurement devise was properly calibrated immediately prior to conducting this test and the time and date of said calibration; and a statement certifying that the recorded measurements are accurate and the same as those detected when the testers conducted the sound production test. 
                  B,  The maximum permitted sound levels shall then be included in the application for a sound production permit and the permit itself. 
                  C.  The sound measurement device shall be provided by the city and shall be used, properly calibrated and maintained by the city in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A tester using a city owned sound measurement device shall not in anyway alter or tamper with the device. Doing so will be a violation of this chapter and grounds for revocation of any permit issued based on a sound production test using an altered or tampered device. 
                  D.  Except where provided in this subsection or in subsection E of this section, applicants shall bear the cost of conducting a sound production tests and use testers as defined herein. As an alternative, applicants may allow the city to use its own testers provided applicants commit in writing to cover the costs incurred by the city to conduct sound production tests. 
                  E.  If the city or its designee's determines, through its own sound production test, that the results of the sound production test preformed on behalf of the establishment or subject establishment is erroneous or inaccurate, the city council may take those actions permitted under subsection E of Section 9.03.040 provided it complies with the procedures set forth therein. Moreover, if the test reveals that the test results were inaccurate or erroneous, the applicant shall be liable to the city for the costs of such tests.

                  C.  Permit holders or owners or operators of a permitted subject establishment who exceed or allow or tolerate an excedence of any maximum permitted sound level specified in their sound production permit shall be in violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the penalties set forth herein. 
                  D.  Owners or operators of subject establishments who allow or tolerate the use or operation of any ASPD outside the heated space of the building shall be in violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties set forth herein. 
                  E.  For enforcement purposes, the sound measurement device shall be provided by the city, and the city or those identified above who have been authorized to enforce this chapter shall use, properly calibrate and maintain said device in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. 
                  F.  The owner or operator of an establishment shall allow the city, its employees, agents, representatives and designees to enter upon the premises of an establishment at a appropriate hour to conduct an initial test, in accordance with subsections (A)(1) and (A)(2) of Section 9.03.050, to determine if sound producing devices then located at the establishment rise to the level of an ASPD. 
                  G.  The owner or operator of a subject establishment shall allow the city, its employees, agents, representatives, and designees as well as the Henry County Police Department and Henry County Sheriff's Department the right to, at any time, enter upon the premises of the subject establishment for the purpose of measuring sound levels at the measurement marker and enforcement of this ordinance and/or the terms of any sound production permit for the subject establishment. Any measurement taken for enforcement purposes shall be taken for a period of one minute and during the absence of background noise.

                  B.  The manner in which the applicant and/or any licensee as defined in Section 9.04.170 has conducted any business within the city as to necessity for unusual police observation and inspection in order to prevent the violation of any federal, state, county or municipal law, administrative regulation or ordinance or as to the necessity for city action to compel the applicant's and/or licensee's adherence to any federal, state, county or city law, administrative regulation or ordinance;

For purposes of this subsection, "premises are unsuitable for alcoholic beverage sales" if the premises have been the situs for four (4) or more violations of any named categories of offense in the five (5) year period preceding the current license application, regardless of license holder.

                  9.17.020 - License required. 
                  No person shall conduct business as a dealer in precious metals or gems or maintain an establishment for the purposes of conducting business as a dealer in precious metals or gems, until a business license has been obtained from the city clerk. Such license application shall be made to the city clerk and license issued upon approval of the mayor and city council. 
                  (Ord. No. 11-253, § 1, 6-13-2011) 
                  9.17.030 - Limitation on issuance. 
                  A.  Preliminary Findings. 
                  1.  As a municipality located within the Atlanta Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area which is experiencing rapid growth and change due to urbanization of our county and being familiar with the experiences of other urban and suburban counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Atlanta, Dekalb County, and Fulton County, Georgia, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, the mayor and council take note of the well known and self-evident conditions attendant to the operation of businesses by dealer in precious metals or gems, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
                  2.  Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that operation of businesses by dealers in precious metals or gems under certain circumstances, leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions. 
                  3.  Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the operation of businesses by dealers in precious metals or gems, are theft, burglary, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of minors. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with such businesses, are actual or perceived depression of property values or acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation in expenditures for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and an increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this section. 
                  4.  Accordingly, it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of businesses operated by dealers in precious metals or gems by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of such businesses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semipublic uses; to ensure that businesses operated by dealers in precious metals or gems do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts. 
                  5.  Therefore, the numerical limitation of businesses operated by dealers in precious metals or gems is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with such activities. To that end, the ordinance codified in this section is adopted. 
                  B.  No precious metal or gems dealer's license shall be issued to any person or to any dealer in precious metals or gems who has been convicted of any crime involving as an element thereof the theft of property. 
                  C.  The city shall issue a maximum of three (3) licenses to dealers in precious metals or gems. No additional licenses shall be issued unless the population of the City of Stockbridge reaches twenty thousand (20,000) residents, at which time one additional license may be permitted for each five thousand (5,000) residents of the city over the twenty thousand (20,000) initial threshold. No application for a license to do business as a dealer in precious metals and gems shall be considered or approved or a license issued where the total number of precious metals and gems dealer licenses issued and in effect at the time of such application numbers at least one (1) for each five thousand (5,000) residents according to the latest officially and finally published annual population estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau. In making this computation, fractions of each five thousand (5,000) residents shall not be considered. For purposes of this section, nonconforming precious metals and gems licenses shall be included for purposes of calculating the number of outstanding licenses. 
                  D.  Whenever it shall be recognized by the city treasurer that the release of population projections by the U.S. Census Bureau results in the availability of one (1) or more additional licenses, and it is determined by the city treasurer that one (1) or more additional licenses are available, the city shall publish a notice, one time, advising the public of such, and that applications will be received for a period of forty-five (45) days subsequent to the publication. If, during this period, applications are received which exceed the number of newly available licenses, there shall be held a lottery, administered by the city treasurer, to determine the order in which applications shall be processed. Thereafter, the applications shall be processed in the order reflected in the results of the lottery. Once the proceeding of applications has resulted in the issuance of licenses up to the limit contained in this chapter, the remaining applications shall be returned to the applicants, unprocessed. If no applications are received during the forty-five-day period after publication, applications shall thereafter be processed in the order in which they may thereafter be received.

Outdoor festivals falling outside of this definition may be treated by the city as separate outdoor festivals and regulated under this ordinance, or may be treated as parades or demonstrations under city code Section 9.28.020 as the facts dictate and as determined by the city manager. Properly permitted outdoor festivals can be held on a temporary basis, in whole or in part, on public property such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, provided that all applicable ordinances are followed. 
                  B.  It is unlawful for any person or entity to use the city streets or sidewalks, or any real property belonging to the city for the purpose of an outdoor festival without having first obtained a written permit from the city to do so. All such permits are to be obtained from the city council upon recommendation of the city manager. In determining whether to grant a permit, the city may consider the outdoor festival hours, the noise generated by the outdoor festival, the size of the outdoor festival, the traffic conditions prevailing in the city at the time, and the likely hazards and inconvenience to citizens and traffic as a result of the proposed outdoor festival. Outdoor festivals held or officially sponsored by the city are exempted from the permit requirement. 
                  C.  Persons desiring to hold an outdoor festival must apply to the city for an outdoor festival permit at least sixty (60) days prior to the first date of the outdoor festival for which a permit is sought.

The fee amount shall be determined by the city manager and published in a fee schedule available to applicants. 
                  E.  Outdoor festivals that are properly permitted by the city shall be permitted to allow vending of food and beverages within a defined portion of the festival gathering area (which should be identified in detail on the outdoor festival permit application if food and/or beverages are to be sold), provided that all laws of the State of Georgia pertaining to health and safety are observed. 
                  F.  In addition, alcoholic beverages may be sold during outdoor festivals in the food and beverage vending portion of the festival gathering area during the festival, provided that any vendor selling alcoholic beverages must be previously licensed by the State of Georgia and a local government in Georgia for retail sales of alcoholic beverages of the type to be sold during the festival. Each such vendor of alcoholic beverages must also obtain a permit for outdoor festival alcoholic beverage sales from the city, and it shall be unlawful to sell alcoholic beverages at an outdoor festival in the city without such a permit. The permit application shall be on a form prescribed by the city, which shall be submitted to the city at least forty-five (45) days in advance of the planned first date of the outdoor festival. The application shall request identifying information from the vendor, and shall require that the vendor submit proof of its license from the State of Georgia and a local government for the retail sale of alcoholic beverages of the type planned to be sold by that vendor. The city may charge a festival alcohol vendor's fee in an amount to be determined by the city to reasonably approximate the cost to the city of processing the alcohol vendor application, and providing all necessary services to the festival that result from the consumption of alcoholic beverages sold by that vendor. Vendors of alcoholic beverages at outdoor festivals held or officially sponsored by the city are not exempted from obtaining an alcoholic beverage vending permit. 
                  G.  To the extent that subsection F above conflicts with any of the provisions of Title 9, Chapter 9.04 of the city code relating to alcoholic beverages, subsection F shall control. However, nothing herein shall otherwise exempt a vendor of alcoholic beverages from abiding by Title 9, Chapter 9.04 of the city code or Georgia law relating to the retail sale of alcoholic beverages. 
                  H.  The city shall require that a uniformed on-duty police officer provide safety and security at all outdoor festivals at which alcohol is served, and at any outdoor festival which is reasonably expected to attract more than two hundred fifty (250) persons at any one time during the festival.

               <head>Chapter 9.44 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS </head>
               <p>                  Sections: 

                  9.44.010 - Adult entertainment establishments—Findings—Public purpose. 
                  A.  As a municipality located within the Atlanta Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area which is experiencing rapid growth and change due to urbanization of our county and being familiar with the experiences of other urban and suburban counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Atlanta, DeKalb County and Fulton County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, California; Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio and Indianapolis, Indiana, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city of Stockbridge, Georgia, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. The mayor and council also take note of studies concerning such conditions in many of the aforementioned municipalities. 
                  B.  Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values. 
                  C.  Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, and live commercial nudity in general, are disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, and commercial nudity in general, are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. 
                  D.  Accordingly, it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment establishments upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semipublic uses; to insure that adult entertainment establishments do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment establishments in heavily used public pedestrian areas. 
                  E.  Therefore, the limitation of adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the city is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment. To that end, the ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted.

The requirement regarding the number of tenants shall be satisfied upon proof that the tower is structurally designed to accommodate the required number of antenna arrays. 
                  B.  Setbacks. 
                  1.  Attached WCFs. Antenna arrays for attached WCFs are exempt from the setback standards of this section and from the setbacks for the zone in which they are located. An attached WCF antenna array may extend up to eight feet (8′) horizontally beyond the edge of the attachment structure so long as the antenna array does not encroach upon an adjoining parcel. 
                  2.  WCFs with Support Structures. The following setbacks requirements shall apply to all WCFs with support structures: 
                  a.  In residential (RA, R-1, R-2, R-3, RD, RM, RMH), office and institutional (OI), and neighborhood commercial (C-1) zoning districts, towers must be set back a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of tower height, plus one (1) additional foot for each two feet (2′) of tower height in excess of seventy-five feet (75′). 
                  b.  Towers must be set back a minimum of twenty-five feet (25′) from any property line in the C-2 zoning district. Where property abuts a residentially-zoned parcel, then the setback shall be a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of tower height, plus one (1) additional foot for each two feet (2′) of tower height in excess of seventy-five feet (75′). 
                  c.  Towers must be set back a minimum of twenty feet (20′) from any property line in C-3, M-l, and M-2 zoning districts. Where property abuts a residentially-zoned parcel, then the setback shall be a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of tower height, plus one (1) additional foot for each two feet (2′) of tower height in excess of seventy-five feet (75′). 
                  C.  Landscaping and Buffer Requirements. 
                  1.  WCFs shall be landscaped in accordance with the landscape requirements contained in Sections 3-7- 216 through 3-7-227 off the Henry County zoning ordinance, except for additional requirements stated herein. 
                  2.  Landscaping and buffer requirements can be waived where the WCF applicant makes other means of screening the support structure base and adjacent equipment facilities (i.e., opaque fencing, etc.). The waiver shall be in writing by the community development director pending an administrative review of development plans. 
                  3.  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the extent feasible; provided, however, that vegetation that causes interference with the antennas or inhibits access to the equipment facility may be trimmed. 
                  4.  Existing vegetation on site may be used in lieu of required landscaping where approved by the community development director. 
                  5.  Landscaping shall be confined to the leased area of the WCF wherever feasible. 
                  6.  Additional Landscaping and Buffer Requirements. 
                  a.  In single-family and two-family residential zoning districts (RA, R-1, R-2, R-3, RD, RM and/or RMH), a ten foot (10′) perimeter buffer is required, with a minimum of one (1) tree per twenty (20) lineal feet of buffer, with a minimum of fifty percent (50%) being shade trees. Retention of existing trees on site in order to meet this requirement is encouraged. Grass or other groundcover species shall be planted on all areas of the buffer strip required which are not covered by other landscape material. 
                  b.  In the remaining office, commercial, and industrial districts (OI, C-1, C-2, C-3, M-1 and/or M-2), an additional ten foot (10′) buffer shall be required, with landscaping provided according to Section 9.52.040(C)(1). 
                  7.  Maintenance. It will be the responsibility of the owner/tenant to keep all landscaping material (as part of the landscaped area) free from disease and properly maintained in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was established. The owners of the property, and any tenant on the property where buffers and landscaping are required, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping materials. Such maintenance shall include all actions necessary to keep the buffer and landscape areas free from litter and debris, to keep plantings healthy, and to keep planting areas neat in appearance. Any vegetation that constitutes part of the buffer or landscaping shall be replaced in the event it dies. 
                  D.  Aesthetics, Placement, Materials and Color. 
                  1.  Attached WCFs shall have both antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment that are of a neutral color identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  2.  WCFs with support structures shall consist of towers with a galvanized steel finish, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, in the C-3, M-1 and M-2 zoning districts. In the remaining zoning districts (RA, R-1, R-2, R-3, RD, RM, RMH, OI, C-1, C-2), WCFs with support structures shall consist of towers with a galvanized steel finish that, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, shall be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. At a tower site, the design of the building and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. WCFs with support structures shall be of the monopole variety except when providers can document and demonstrate need for lattice-type towers. 
                  E.  Separation Requirement. In zoning districts other than general/heavy commercial and industrial (C-2, C-3, M-1, M-2), WCFs over one hundred fifty feet (150′) in height shall not be located within one-quarter of a mile from any existing WCF that is over one hundred fifty feet (150′) feet in height. This requirement may be waived upon evidence provided to the community development director by the applicant that the nearest tower cannot support any new antenna arrays. 
                  F.  Lighting. All WCFs shall be lighted consistent with FAA regulations for tower illumination regardless of height. Any objection by the applicant based on FAA restrictions shall be presented in writing to the community development director. 
                  G.  Noise. No equipment shall be operated at a WCF so as to produce noise which would constitute a nuisance based on local or state laws, except for in emergency situations requiring the use of a backup generator, where the noise standards may be exceeded on a temporary basis, not to exceed fourteen (14) days. No generator shall be used for regular WCF operations prior to commercial power being delivered to the site. 
                  H.  Security Fencing. WCFs with support structures shall be enclosed by a security fence of neutral color not less than six feet (6′) in height. The support structure shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. 
                  I.  Radio Frequency Emissions. The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (FTA) gives the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) sole jurisdiction of the field of regulation of radio frequency (RF) emissions and WCFs which meet the FCC standards shall not be conditioned or denied on the basis of RF impacts. 
                  J.  Federal Requirements. All WCFs must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the WCFs governed by this chapter shall bring such antenna arrays and/or support structures into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective dates of such standards and regulations. Failure to bring WCFs into compliance with such revised standards and regulation shall constitute grounds for the removal of the WCF at the owner's expense by utilizing the bond required in Section 9.52.080. 
                  K.  Structural Integrity. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the Electronic Industries Association/Telecom-munications Industries (EIA/TIA) 222 Revision F Standard entitled Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures (or equivalent), as amended from time to time. A letter stamped by an engineer certified in the state of Georgia shall be required stating that the WCF and support structure meet or exceed all applicable requirements set forth herein. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the tower's owner, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense by utilizing the bond required in Section 9.52.080 of this chapter.

Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
                  a.  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  b.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  c.  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment; 
                  d.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna; 
                  e.  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable; 
                  f.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  8.  Findings (Denials). All denials rendered by either the planning and zoning board or the governing authority under a conditional use permit shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon substantial evidence in the record. 
                  9.  Timing of Decision. The planning and zoning board and/or the governing authority shall render its decision within ninety (90) days of application, unless either the board or the governing authority can demonstrate that more time is reasonably required due to extenuating circumstances.

                  Article I. - General. 

                  9.80.010 - Short title. 
                  This article shall be known as the "Stockbridge Vacant and Foreclosed Property Ordinance."

                  9.80.020 - Findings and intent. 
                  This chapter is adopted in order to address the interest of public safety. 
                  A.  The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property registry as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners. 
                  B.  Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted. 
                  C.  Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person or entity responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Stockbridge to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions of this article. 
                  D.  This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the City of Stockbridge with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of the Stockbridge Municipal Code.

                  C.  Each individual day that a property remains out of compliance with this section shall constitute a separate offense warranting a separate penalty provided that a city employee shall on each day so cited as an offense, provide the owner or lawful tenant on the property, or both, with a citation or accusation on each such day, together with a notice warning said persons that the failure to bring the property into compliance will result in additional daily violations. No such notice need be provided prior to the initial occasion on which the city cites a landowner or other person violating Section 11.16.040, and it is only when the city intends to impose a separate penalty on subsequent days for noncompliance following the initial date that notice hereunder need be provided. 
                  D.  Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-60-4, the city shall have the authority to remove and dispose of any discarded, dismantled, wrecked, scrapped, ruined, or junked motor vehicles or parts thereof when requested by the owner or when such motor vehicles are in such a condition that they constitute a health hazard or unsightly nuisance, notwithstanding the fact that such motor vehicles may be located upon private property. The city shall also have the power and authority to contract with private individuals and firms to remove discarded, dismantled, wrecked, scrapped, ruined, or junked motor vehicles or parts thereof. When removing any such motor vehicles or parts, the city shall use its best efforts to notify the landowner and/or the owner of the vehicles or parts at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the removal of those items. This subsection shall not apply to any motor vehicle or part thereof which is located within the premises of any junkyard complying with the laws of the State of Georgia relating to the licensing and regulating of junk vehicles. 
                  E.  Violations of Section 11.16.040 rising to the level of a nuisance may be abated, when appropriate under the law, with costs cast upon the landowner, tenant, or other appropriate person pursuant to the procedures found in Title 11, Chapter 08 of this Code and state law.

                  11.20.010 - Prohibited within corporate limits of the city. 
                  A.  A person commits the offense of loitering or prowling when he is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. 
                  B.  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this code section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this code section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

Any person who fails or refuses to obey such orders shall be guilty of a violation of this chapter. Any such violation shall constitute a separate offense on each successive day continued. 
                  B.  Any person found guilty of violating this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of not more than three hundred dollars ($300.00) for each offense, or confinement for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months for each offense, or any combination of both.

                  11.26.030 - Sound measurement procedures and maximum permissible sound levels. 
                  A.  Sound Measurement Procedures. 
                  1.  Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as necessary, at other conditions, including but not limited to, design, maximum, and fluctuating rates. All noise measurements shall be made at or within the property line of the impacted site, unless otherwise directed in this ordinance. When instrumentation cannot be placed at or within the property line, the measurement shall be made as close thereto as is reasonable. However, noise measurements shall not be made at a distance of less than twenty-five (25) feet from the edge of a noise source. 
                  2.  All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures: 
                  (1)  The city shall, to the extent practicable, identify all sources contributing sound to the point of measurement. 
                  (2)  Measurements shall be taken at or within the property line of the affected person(s), including the city. 
                  (3)  The SLM must be calibrated using a calibrator recommended by the SLM manufacturer before and after each series of readings and at least once each hour. 
                  (4)  The SLM must be recertified and the calibrator must be recalibrated at least once each year by the manufacturer or by a person that has been approved by the NCA. A copy of written documentation of such recertification and recalibration, in a form approved by the NCA, shall be kept with the equipment to which it refers. 
                  (5)  No outdoor measurements shall be taken: 
                  a.  During periods when wind speeds (including gusts) exceed fifteen (15) mph; 
                  b.  Without a windscreen, recommended by the SLM manufacturer, properly attached to the SLM; 
                  c.  Under any condition that allows the SLM to become wet; or 
                  d.  When the ambient temperature is out of the range of the tolerance of the SLM. 
                  3.  The report for each measurement session shall include: 
                  A.  The date, day of the week, and times at which measurements are taken: 
                  B.  The times of calibration; 
                  C.  The weather conditions; 
                  D.  The identification of all monitoring equipment by manufacturer, model number, and serial number; 
                  E.  The normal operating cycle of the sources in question with a description of the sources; 
                  F.  The ambient sound level, in dBA, with the sources in question operating; 
                  G.  The background sound level, in dBA, without the sources in question operating; and 
                  H.  A sketch of the measurement site, including measurement locations and relevant distances, containing sufficient information for another investigator to repeat the measurements under similar conditions. 
                  4.  Prior to taking noise measurements, a city official or his designee shall explore the vicinity of the source in question to identify any other sound sources that could affect measurements, to establish the approximate location and character of the principal sound source, and to select suitable locations from which to measure the sound from the source in question. 
                  5.  When measuring continuous sound, or sound that is sustained for more than one second at a time, the SLM shall be set for A-weighting, slow meter response speed, and the range (if the SLM is designed to read levels over different ranges of SPLs) shall be set to that range in which the meter reads closest to the maximum end of the scale. When the measured sound level is variable or fluctuating over a range greater than ± three (3) dBA, using the slow meter response speed, the fast meter response speed shall be used. In either case, both the minimum and maximum readings shall be recorded to indicate the range of monitored values. 
                  6.  The SLM shall be placed at a minimum height of three (3′) feet above the ground or from any reflective surface. When handheld, the microphone shall be held at arm's length and pointed at the source at the angle recommended by the SLM manufacturer. 
                  7.  If extraneous sound sources, such as aircraft flyovers or barking dogs, that are unrelated to the measurements increase the monitored sound levels, the measurements should be postponed until these extraneous sounds have become of such a level as not to increase the monitored sound levels of interest. 
                  8.  The monitoring session should last for a period of time sufficient to ensure that the sound levels measured are typical of the source in question, but in no event shall the duration of testing be less than five (5) minutes. 
                  9.  The background sound levels shall be subtracted from the measured sound levels of the source of interest by using Table 1 to determine the sound levels from the source of interest alone. If the ambient sound level is less than three (3) dBA higher than the background sound level, the source level cannot be derived and a violation of the article cannot be substantiated.

                  B.  Maximum Permissible Sound Levels 
                  a.  It shall be unlawful, except as expressly permitted herein, to make, cause or allow the making of any noise or sound which violates the provisions of this article. 
                  b.  No person shall operate or cause to be operated any source of sound from any location in such a manner as to create a sound level which exceeds the limits set forth in Table 2 for the receiving land use category (zoning classification) as measured at any point along the real property boundary separating the real property from which the sound emanates from the receiving land use category. 
                  c.  Sound level measurement shall be made with a sound level meter using the A-weighting scale in accordance with the standards promulgated by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for a Type 2 or better sound level instrument and with the measurement period being the minimum of thirty (30) minutes continuous duration. 
                  d.  Impulsive sounds as defined in this chapter shall be permitted provided such impulsive sounds do not create a sound level which exceeds the limits set forth in Table 2 for the receiving land use category as measured at the real property boundary when measured at or beyond the property boundary of the land use category from which the sound emanates. 
                  e.  If the sound source in question is a pure tone then the sound level limitations set forth here in Table 2 shall be reduced by five (5) db. 
                  MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE SOUND  LEVELS Leq dB (A)

                  12.02.070 - Reserved. 
                  12.02.080 - Establishment of the PTD, Planned town development district; development standards. 
                  12.02.081  Purpose. 
                  A.  The purpose of the Planned Town Development (PTD) District is to encourage development of compatible land uses within the framework of a master development plan for residential and nonresidential uses within an environmentally compatible setting. Tracts of one hundred (100) acres or larger are required for this district, except where a PTD consists entirely of a mixed use neighborhood development (MUND), that threshold may be reduced to thirty (30) acres. The PTD district is designed to include residential and commercial, office, institutional (i.e., nonresidential), or industrial zoning districts as appropriate to provide flexibility in the application of development standards and site design when approved according to a master development plan. Such plans shall promote the conservation of natural environment, more efficient use of land, and efficiency in the extension of streets and utilities. 
                  B.  The PTD sets forth a framework for traditional neighborhood development (TND) and MUND that encourages pedestrian-scale residential and nonresidential activities to be designed in such a way as to reduce the number and type of vehicle trips, limiting traffic congestion and thereby improving air quality. MUND, in addition, incorporates multifamily dwellings into a PTD with an emphasis on vertical and horizontal integration of residential and nonresidential uses. Conventional development (CD) is also permitted in a manner to promote clustering of dwellings. Each of these development types are designed to reserve areas for recreation and open space, enhance pedestrian and cyclist movement, and provide buffers between residential and nonresidential uses. A master development plan may contain one or more of these development types. In addition, net densities herein are in accordance with the benchmarks established by the comprehensive plan. 
                  C.  All PTDs shall be located on paved county/city roads with a minimum classification of arterial according to the Henry County Functional Road Plan. In most cases, each area within a PTD project developed for residential (including required open space and recreation amenities), commercial, office, institutional, or industrial land use shall be designated separately according to the master development plan unless a mix of uses within the site can better accomplish the goals established herein. Projects shall consist of more than one type of land use to be considered a PTD project. 
                  12.02.082 Objectives. A PTD district shall provide the following elements, as appropriate, to carry out the purpose of this section: 
                  A.  A range of residential settings, including various housing types, and community facilities/recreation activities; 
                  B.  Nonresidential land uses, if any, which provide convenient service, employment and access; 
                  C.  Conservation of natural topographic and geologic features with emphasis on the following: 
                  1.  Conservation of existing surface and ground water resources, 
                  2.  Preservation of large trees and other significant natural features, 
                  3.  Prevention of soil erosion. 
                  D.  An efficient, usable network of streets, sidewalks, nonautomotive routes and utilities appropriate to serve the uses within the PTD district; 
                  E.  Creation of a mix of uses that decreases reliance on automobiles and encourages the use of alternate transportation modes; 
                  F.  A master development plan to guide the PTD with specific development objectives that shall be included in conditions, covenants and restrictions. 
                  12.02.083 Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall have the meaning immediately set forth after the term: 
                  "Alleys" or "alleyways." An alley or alleyway shall mean a private alley located in the rear of residential uses that provides residents with vehicular access to their residences. Alleys shall be maintained by the adjoining property owners, homeowners' associations or condominium/apartment associations.

Concrete alleys shall be reinforced and have a minimum depth of six (6) inches with appropriate base. Asphalt alleys shall consist of a minimum of two (2) inches of type "E" or "F" asphalt topping, binder, and (6) six inches of graded aggregate base. Private alleys, at a minimum, shall be constructed to provide adequate turning radii onto public streets, driveways, residential parking garages and carports for full-size, noncommercial, two-axle vehicles. Curbs and gutters are not required. Private alleyways shall not have dead ends but, in limited circumstances and upon specific approval by the city, may have cul-de-sacs where the alley serves a small number of residences or the topography of the land makes an exit impracticable. 
                  "Amenity area." The area(s) set aside for active and passive recreation for the residents inside the PTD (or for the public) according to the standards set forth herein. Recreation areas may include passive areas, such as trails, picnic areas, or parks with landscaping providing no facilities for active sports; and active areas, with ball fields, soccer facilities, swimming areas and other active recreational facilities. 
                  "Central park." This term shall mean a park for active or passive recreational use consisting of no less than one (1) net useable acre. A central park should be located in the approximate center of the development.

The comprehensive long-range plan containing policies to guide the growth and development of the City of Stockbridge, which includes the analysis, recommendations and proposals for the population, economy, housing, transportation, community facilities, and land use. 
                  "Conventional development (CD)." Typical "cookie cutter" form of development along with related commercial and industrial activities in a town center and/or industrial park setting that is typical in modern development practices. This type of development is designed mainly for single-family homes, extensive use of buffering, landscaping and amenities, and commercial and/or industrial uses oriented to ease vehicular traffic. This does not exclude the use of pedestrian and bicycle facilities to make these developments more accessible. 
                  "Density." The number of dwelling units (du) allowed for each net usable acre (nua), i.e., du/nua. 
                  "Density credits." The amount of additional density applicable to a type of development in the PTD according to performance criteria established herein. 
                  "Density debits." The amount of density deducted from the type of PTD development according to performance criteria established herein. 
                  "Du/nua." See density. 
                  "Garage, residential parking." A residential parking garage shall mean an enclosed structure attached to or part of the principal dwelling used for housing at least two (2) vehicles and has the following minimum dimensions: vehicular entrance height, eight (8) feet; interior height, ten (10) feet; vehicular entrance width, sixteen (16) feet; and overall garage width and depth, twenty-four (24) feet. The floor shall be constructed of concrete. Concrete floors shall be reinforced, where appropriate, and a minimum of four (4) inches in thickness with appropriate fill and base. Where residential parking garages are constructed, such structures shall not be enclosed for living space, storage purposes or any other purpose without first obtaining a variance from the city and constructing an attached residential parking garage. 
                  "Loft-apartment." A loft-apartment is an apartment as defined in Appendix A. Master List of Acronyms and Definitions, but located in a mixed-use building above commercial or office space. 
                  "Loft-condominium." A loft-condominium is a condominium as defined in Appendix A. Master List of Acronyms and Definitions, but located in a mixed-use building above commercial or office space. 
                  "Master development plan." A written and graphic submission for a planned town development which represents a tract of land; proposed subdivision; the location and bulk of buildings and other structures; density of development; streets, alleyways, sidewalks, and multi-use paths; parking facilities; common recreation and open space; public facilities and civic space; and all conditions, covenants and restrictions relating to use thereof. The master development plan is submitted in conjunction with a rezoning application for the PTD district. 
                  "Maximum net density." The absolute limit for number of dwelling units per net usable acre (du/nua) for a particular use or type of development except when increased or decreased by density credits or debits, respectively, but never to exceed the secondary limit when density credits are used. Note: Density for a particular use may vary within a development area so long as the overall density for that use in the PTD does not exceed the maximum net density for that particular use. 
                  "Mixed use neighborhood development (MUND)." A MUND is a development designed to unify business, residential, civic and open space within the city of Stockbridge in a manner that increases the connection between work, home and place, decreases vehicle trips, and encourages alternative transportation modes. A MUND consists of areas of compact, urban residential development consisting of detached single family homes, townhouses, condominiums, lofts, and apartments with alleys (typically), rear garages (attached or detached), front porches (typically for single family detached homes and townhouses), balcony porches (typically for condominiums, lofts and apartments), pocket parks, formal parks, amenity and other civic areas, and planned streetscapes. Typically, MUND places the bulk of parking at the rear of buildings, with limited on-street parking, wide sidewalks, storefronts facing the street, street furniture, plazas, public art, street-trees, squares, and residences above nonresidential uses. MUND also requires streets and sidewalks designed to accommodate and encourage pedestrian and bicycle traffic. A MUND contains a planned neighborhood center consisting of a mix of residential uses and nonresidential uses (commercial, office, institutional to a limited extent light manufacturing, civic space, and open space). Generally, nonresidential uses are limited in type and dimension to maintain the character of the development. Unlike TND, the number of lots of a PTD that may be developed as an MUND is limited only to the extent of the area and bulk restrictions set forth herein. 
                  "Net usable acre (nua)." An acre of land on which residential structures may be built but, exclusive of streets; right of ways; one hundred (100) year flood plains or flood hazard areas; detention or retention ponds; land used solely for commercial, office, institutional, or industrial uses and public lands. Easements for drainage, sanitary sewer, etc. shall not be excluded from a net usable acre. 
                  "Nonresidential uses." Those uses that are not residential uses, including but are not limited to: commercial, office, institutional, or industrial uses, streets, drives, and service/parking areas. 
                  "Open space." Land within or related to a development, not individually owned or dedicated for public use, which is designed and intended for the common ownership and use by the residents of the developments and may include complementary structures and improvements as are necessary and appropriate for recreation or other complementary activities. Wetlands under common ownership shall also be included in open space. 
                  "Ownership types." These include all types of residential development including, but not limited to: single family, apartments, townhouses, condominiums, such that ownership may be fee simple, lease purchase, leased or rented and common ownership of open spaces, recreation facilities, and parking areas. 
                  "Perimeter of the development or pod." Where the property abuts adjoining property not included in the PTD master development plan or on adjoining pod of development under the same PTD master development plan but containing a different development type or use. 
                  "Planned industrial district." An area within a PTD project designed for industrial uses with streets, utilities, and common architectural controls regulated by a master development plan and restrictive covenants. 
                  "Planned town center or planned neighborhood center." An area within a PTD which contains a group of commercial and office establishments having a composition that is an architecturally aesthetic unit and is not a miscellaneous assemblage of stores; and is planned, developed, analyzed as a unit, related in location, size and type of shops to the trade area that the unit serves, and provides limited on-site parking in relation to the types and sizes of stores to encourage pedestrian and other modes of access. A set of architectural design standards shall be created and approved prior to development of sites designated as planned town center. 
                  "Pocket park." A pocket park is a park for active or passive recreational uses consisting of no less than one-quarter (¼) of a net useable acre (or fourteen thousand two hundred fifty (14,250) square feet. 
                  Pocket parks may be consolidated provided that the development contains no fewer than one-half (½) the number required and that any consolidated pocket park does not exceed one (1) net useable acre (or forty-three thousand five hundred sixty (43,560) square feet nor contain less than one-half (½) a net useable acre (or twenty-one thousand seven hundred eighty (21,780) square feet. The purpose of pocket parks is to provide open space for recreational use within walking distance of most residences especially those located farthest from amenity areas. Therefore, where required, pocket parks shall be scattered throughout the development but more greatly concentrated in those parts of the development which are the greatest walking distance from an amenity area. 
                  "Preliminary concept plan." A preliminary plan of the proposed planned development, of sufficient accuracy to be used for purpose of reviewing the proposed land uses and general layout.

A TND development consists of areas of compact, urban residential development with alleys, rear garages (attached or detached), front porches (typically), street trees, sidewalks, narrow streets (on-street parking allowed), pocket parks and other formalized park areas that reflect back upon urban neighborhood development in the period of the 1920s-1940s. The planned town center typically places the bulk of parking at the rear of buildings, with limited on-street parking, wide sidewalks, storefronts facing the street, street furniture, plazas, public art, street trees, squares, and, where allowable, residential above storefronts. Generally, commercial activities are limited in scope and bulk to maintain harmony of the development. The number of TND lots shall be limited to fifty (50) percent of the total residential lots of the development. 
                  "Townhouses." See Appendix A. Master List of Acronyms and Definitions. 
                  "Usable land area." Except for adjustments allowed herein, usable land area shall consist of the total net usable acres.

Off-street parking facilities shall be illuminated with downcast lighting using energy efficient bulbs. Upon review, the development director shall make a recommendation to the city council for final review and approval. 
                  c.  The development director may recommend and the city council may require a monetary or other contribution toward community parking facilities in lieu of off-street parking facilities. Said funds shall be placed in an account for the sole purpose of providing parking within the city. 
                  d.  If a parking structure is built for off-street parking, the facades facing public streets shall be designed and constructed to have the appearance of various different store fronts with no less than sixty (60) percent of that facade of the structure consisting of brick. The remaining facade surface may be constructed of stone, glass, stucco or pressed designed concrete blocks. 
                  e.  Required off-street parking shall not be located within any front yard setback or in front of the principal building. Notwithstanding the requirements set forth above, all other nonconflicting commercial landscaping and buffer requirements under the city zoning ordinance shall apply to parking facilities. 
                  5.  Streetscapes. A streetscape is the sum of the man-made and planted features within and adjacent to the street right-of-way that create the character of the public space. The streetscape often includes sidewalks, street trees and plantings, street furniture such as benches, street lights, signs, trash receptacles, railings and fences, fountains, planters, banners and flags, public art and similar publicly visible features. In the nonresidential area of a MUND, the developer shall provide an eight-foot wide sidewalk within the front setback from the edge of the public street; six (6) feet of the front setback which shall be sodded and serve as a landscaped buffer between the street and the sidewalk. The landscaping of these buffer areas shall consist of a minimum of one two and one-half inch caliper tree or more as needed to provide a continuous balanced arrangement with no greater than a forty-foot spacing between trees. The exact species and location shall be determined so that it does not overly obstruct the view of the storefront. Additional vegetation shall be required according to the landscaping provisions of this title. In the nonresidential area of a MUND, the developer should provide one metal trash receptacle and one metal bench. In the nonresidential area of a MUND, the developer should install historic-style street lamps approved by and location chosen by the city manager to provide for the safety of the public. 
                  12.02.089 Amenities. Public buildings and recreation facilities (amenities) for use of the residents of the PTD are required. The restrictions as to the use of these facilities shall be set forth in the covenants and restrictions of the PTD development. The requirements for amenities are listed below: 
                  A.  Amenity Requirements: In order to assure that adequate recreation and open space exists on-site, the following shall guide the PTD development in the development of minimum thresholds for open space and recreation facilities. It is expected that a PTD shall exceed the minimum standards set forth herein. 
                  1.  Amenity and recreation facilities shall be required according to the point system below. The minimum number of points and minimum amenities required shall be dependent on the total acreage of the PTD as shown in Table 2.08.09. A.1. To ensure adequate amenities for the increase in population density allowed under a MUND, where a MUND is used, one-tenth of a point shall be added to the minimum points required for each additional residential unit above the total number of units allowed if the property was developed as a TND with a net density of four and three-fourths (4.75) du/nua. 
                  2.  The point allocation for each type of amenity is shown in Table 12.02.089.A.2. For amenities not listed in Table 2.08.09.A.2, the number of points assigned shall be established by the development director in consultation with the city manager provided the allocation is consistent with those in Table 12.02.089.A.2 and does not exceed twenty-five (25) points. The development director in consultation with the city manager may allow a developer to substitute a single required amenity for one of equal or greater value. 
                  3.  The city council, upon request by the developer, may accept the monetary value of one (1) required amenity in lieu of requiring the developer to provide the amenity. The money paid in lieu of the required amenity shall be used for public parks. 
                  4.  Completion of amenities shall be according to the following schedule: before issuance of fifty (50) percent of the total number of certificates of occupancy (CO's) for the project, fifty(50) percent of the required amenities must be completed and in use; before issuance of sixty (60) percent of the total number of CO's for the project, eighty (80) percent of the required amenities must be completed and in use; and before issuance of eighty (80) percent of the total number of CO's for the project, one hundred (100) percent of the required amenities must be completed and in use.

                  12.02.090 - Establishment of the CRS, conservation residential subdivision district; development standards. 
                  A.  Purpose of the Conservation Residential Subdivision. The purpose of conservation residential subdivision district is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the city by allowing flexibility in the design of certain subdivisions from standard regulations to support permanent protection of green space. 
                  The specific purposes of a conservation residential subdivision district include: 
                  1.  To provide single-family residential subdivisions which permit flexibility of design in order to preserve environmentally sensitive areas and create efficient uses of the land; 
                  2.  To preserve green space and unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, flood plains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands, wildlife habitats, historic features and unique topography; 
                  3.  To permit clustering of dwellings and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount or infrastructure, including paved surfaces, utilities, earthwork and other land disturbing activities; 
                  4.  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential developments; 
                  5.  To conserve a portion of the otherwise developable property as green space in perpetuity. This option is not necessarily intended to allow an applicant to conserve only the portion of the tract that is already unbuildable due to factors such as steep slopes, wetlands or land adjacent to undesirable areas such as landfills or livestock farming; 
                  6.  To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the city; 
                  7.  To promote linking of greenways and corridors between the city and neighboring jurisdictions; 
                  8.  To encourage interactions of persons living in the resulting residential community by clustering dwellings and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood; 
                  9.  To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries; 
                  10.  To incorporate aesthetic design standards that will increase the value of the neighborhood; 
                  11.  To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by promoting views of green space from arterial and collector roads; 
                  12.  To preserve important historical and archaeological sites; 
                  13.  To promote other purpose of the zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations, soil erosion and sediment control ordinance and other ordinances and policies of the city. 
                  B.  Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the meaning prescribed, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 
                  "Conservation easement" means a non-possessory interest of a holder in real property imposing limitations or affirmative obligations for the purposes of which include retaining or protecting natural, scenic, green or open areas of real property, assuring its availability for agricultural, forest, recreational or green space use, protecting natural resources, maintaining or enhancing air or water quality or preserving the historical, architectural, archaeological or cultural aspects of real property. 
                  "Conservation residential subdivision" also known as "CRS" means a single-family residential subdivision design which concentrates lots, dwellings, streets, utilities and related development activities on the more suitable and less environmentally sensitive areas of the site, thereby preserving the steep slopes, wetlands, unsuitable soils, stream corridors and otherwise environmentally sensitive areas in a natural or undisturbed state. A CRS allows for a slightly higher net density than that typically allowed for the underlying zoning classification of the property, and smaller lot sizes in order to preserve the environmentally sensitive areas in dedicated, perpetual green space. 
                  "Density bonus" is the amount of additional density applicable to a type of development in the conservation residential subdivision district according to quality construction standards established in this section. 
                  "Dwelling" means a building which is designated or used exclusively to provide a single family detached residence, exclusive of multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, hotels, motels or manufactured homes. 
                  "Green space" means an area of land within the subdivision boundary which shall remain in a permanent undeveloped condition except for amenities areas. The ownership, uses, limitations of use and maintenance of such land shall be determined through a written management plan to be approved by the city at or before approval of the final plat for property which has been approved for a conditional use for a CRS. The green space shall include net usable acres and may include non-useable acres within the gross acreage of the subdivision. 
                  "Holder" means a governmental body empowered to hold an interest in real property under the laws of this state or the United States; or a charitable corporation, charitable association or charitable trust, the purposes of powers of which include retaining or protecting the natural, scenic or green space values of real property, assuring the availability of real property for agricultural, forest, recreational or green space use, protecting natural resources, maintaining or enhancing air or water quality or preserving the historical, architectural, archaeological or cultural aspects of real property. 
                  "Master development plan" is a site plan that depicts the proposed subdivision layout including lot dimensions, right-of-way (street) layout, parking facilities, sidewalks, multi-use paths, detention or retention facilities, green space area including any physiographic characteristics, buffers and amenities. The master development plan shall also provide the amount of land in one hundred (100) year flood plain, rights-of-way, detention or retention ponds, non-residential lands, public lands, net usable acres and amount of greenspace. Furthermore, the master development plan shall state the proposed density; quality construction standards to be met and the corresponding density bonuses to be applied, if any; percentage of impervious surfaces; and any other information required by the city. 
                  "Net usable acre (nua)" means an acre of land on which dwellings may be built but exclusive of streets; rights-of-way; one hundred (100) year flood plains or flood hazard areas; detention or retention ponds; land used solely for commercial, office, institutional or industrial uses, and public lands. Easements for drainage, sanitary sewer, etc. shall not be excluded from a net usable acre. 
                  "Pocket parks" are parks for active or passive recreational uses consisting of no less than one-quarter (¼) of a net useable acre (or fourteen thousand two hundred and fifty (14,250) square feet). The purpose of pocket parks is to provide green space for recreational use within walking distance of most residences especially those located farthest from amenity areas or access to green space. Therefore, pocket parks shall be scattered throughout the development but more greatly concentrated in those parts of the development which are the greatest walking distance from an amenity area or access to green space. 
                  "Private alleyway" shall mean an alley located in the rear of dwellings that provides residents with vehicular access. Private alleyways shall be maintained pursuant to the rules, regulations and policies of the city at the expense of the adjoining property owners or homeowners' association. The developer or landowner shall grant the appropriate easement so the public may use the private alleyway. Private alleyways shall be constructed to meet the following requirements: 
                  1.  Private alleyways shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet in width and eighteen (18) feet thereof shall be paved with concrete or asphalt. 
                  2.  Concrete alleyways shall be reinforced and have a minimum depth of six (6) inches with appropriate base. 
                  3.  Asphalt alleyways shall consist of a minimum of two (2) inches of type "E" or "F" asphalt topping, binder and six (6) inches of graded aggregate base. Private alleyways, at a minimum, shall be constructed so as to provide adequate turning radii onto public streets, driveways, residential parking garages and carports for full-size, non-commercial, two (2) axle vehicles. Curbs and gutters should be provided, but are not required. 
                  4.  Private alleyways shall not have dead ends. 
                  "Residential parking garage" shall mean an enclosed structure attached to or part of the principal dwelling used for housing at least two (2) vehicles and has the following minimum dimensions: 
                  1.  Vehicular entrance height, eight (8) feet; interior height, ten (10) feet; vehicular entrance width, sixteen (16) feet; and overall garage width and depth, twenty-four (24) feet. The floor shall be constructed of concrete. 
                  2.  Concrete floors shall be reinforced, where appropriate, and a minimum of four (4) inches in thickness with appropriate fill and base. 
                  3.  Residential parking garages shall not be enclosed for living space, storage purposes or any other purpose without first obtaining a variance from the city and constructing an attached residential parking garage to the main residential structure. The residential parking garage shall be kept clear so that a minimum of one (1) vehicle may be parked in the garage at all times. 
                  "Standard subdivision" means the form of subdivision design where all land areas within the development are divided into building lots and rights-of-way and where there is little or no green space land set aside outside of building lots and rights-of-way for preservation in its natural or undeveloped condition. 
                  "Third party right of enforcement" means the right provided in a conservation easement to enforce any of its terms granted to a governmental body, charitable corporation, charitable association or charitable trust, which, although eligible to be a holder, is not a holder. 
                  C.  Permitted Locations. 
                  1.  A conservation residential subdivision ("CRS"), as defined herein, is permitted as a conditional use in RA, R-l, R-2 and R-3 districts. An application for a CRS as a conditional use shall include all information required for a zoning amendment and shall be presented to the city council for final approval. 
                  2.  A CRS shall have an entrance and exit which opens onto an arterial road. A CRS, however, may be permitted where the entrance and exit opens onto a collector street provided a traffic study has been completed by the City, the developer has reimbursed the city for the cost of the study, and the developer agrees to make those road improvements determined necessary by the city council after review of the traffic study. Transfers of property in order to avoid or minimize the scope of this requirement shall not alleviate developer's or owner's responsibility hereunder. 
                  3.  For all CRSs, the homes shall be serviced by public water and public sewer. 
                  D.  Dimensional Requirements for Conservation Residential Subdivisions. The development standards for conservation residential subdivisions shall be as follows: 
                  1.  The minimum property size shall be ten (10) acres. Although no maximum acreage amount is established, the city council reserves the right to restrict the number of acres that may be dedicated for CRS use on a case by case basis. 
                  2.  The minimum lot size shall be six thousand six hundred square feet (6,600 sq ft). 
                  3.  Where the lot has rear vehicular access via a private alleyway, the minimum front setback shall be twenty (20) feet from the public right-of-way. Where the lot has front vehicular access via an internal street, the minimum front setback shall be thirty (30) feet from the public right-of-way line. 
                  4.  The minimum side yard shall be five (5) feet from the side property line but no less than fifteen (15) feet between dwellings. 
                  5.  Where the lot has rear vehicular access via a private alleyway the minimum rear setback shall be thirty (30) feet from the rear property line. Where the lot has front vehicular access via an internal street, the minimum rear setback shall be twenty (20) feet from the rear property line. 
                  6.  The minimum lot width shall be fifty-five (55) feet. 
                  7.  The maximum height shall be forty (40) feet. 
                  E.  Density Restrictions. The net density, except where bonuses are used, shall not exceed the following limits depending on the zoning of the property. 
                  1.  RA District: Maximum of zero point five (0.5) dwelling units per net usable acre without density bonuses. Maximum of one point five (1.5) dwelling units per net usable acre with density bonuses.

                  If the tract on which a CRS is to be developed consists of different single-family residential districts, then the net density for the entire tract shall not exceed that which would have been allowed had each district been separately developed as a CRS. An applicant for a CRS conditional use permit for such a tract shall provide in its application a survey plat, signed and sealed by a registered surveyor in the state of Georgia, indicating the location and net usable acreage of each district for purposes of calculating the overall net density for the tract. The applicant shall provide the net density calculations for each such tract in the master development plan, but may, at the city council's discretion, subdivide the entire property based on an average of the permissible densities for each such tract. 
                  F.  Development Standards. Applications for conservation residential subdivisions as a conditional use shall be processed in the same manner as an application for a zoning map amendment including subject to final approval by the city council. A conditional use application for a CRS that is not compliant with this chapter shall not be accepted and, if accepted, shall nevertheless be invalid. CRS plats shall be processed in the same manner as a standard subdivision plat. An approved final plat shall have an additional marking of CRS, symbolizing the use of conservation residential subdivision development standards. Conditional use permits and final plats for conservation residential subdivisions may be approved by the council provided that the following minimum development standards are met or exceeded: 
                  1.  Forty (40) percent of the net usable acres shall be permanently protected as described elsewhere in this section. 
                  2.  No lands with utility easements shall be used toward meeting the forty (40) percent green space requirement. In the event a particular easement, or use, is not contemplated by this section then the development director, after consultation with the city manager, shall determine if it meets the standard for inclusion in the acreage used for meeting the green space requirement. 
                  3.  At least seventy-five (75) percent of the green space shall be in a contiguous tract. The green space should adjoin any neighboring areas of green space, other protected areas, and non-protected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected greenspace. 
                  4.  A one hundred-foot undisturbed buffer shall be maintained along all exterior streets and a fifty-foot undisturbed buffer along the perimeter of the property to which the CRS conditional use will apply in accordance with the following requirements: 
                  a.  If the property is wooded and the timber has not been cut in the past five (5) years, the above required buffers shall remain undisturbed. 
                  b.  If timber on the property has been cut within the last five (5) years or if the property is partially wooded and partially open or entirely open, the above required buffers in the wooded area shall be undisturbed and buffers in open or timbered areas shall be enhanced with a planted vegetative buffer. Said vegetative buffer shall consist of a minimum of four (4) rows of trees planted with twenty foot (20′) separation between trees and staggered to provide vegetative screen. Three-quarters (¾) of the trees must be canopy trees with the remainder consisting of understory trees as defined, listed, and of a minimum size as prescribed in the city landscaping ordinance. Existing trees in the buffer area shall be incorporated into the planted vegetative buffer. 
                  These required buffers are in addition to and shall not be included in the lot setback required for a CRS. 
                  5.  Along both sides of perennial and intermittent streams or rivers a one hundred-foot and a fifty-foot undisturbed buffer, respectively, shall be maintained. Also, a one hundred-foot undisturbed buffer shall be maintained around all wetlands, ponds and lakes; but access easements of no wider than fifteen (15) feet may be cleared. The number and location of such easements shall be determined by the city manager. 
                  6.  All dedications, easements, or other specific measures required to be done to meet the regulations of this section shall be completed prior to the issuance of a building permit on any lot of the subdivision. 
                  7.  No less than thirty (30) percent of the dwellings shall consist of all sides brick, except for soffits. No less than twenty (20) percent of the dwellings shall consist of all sides brick, stone, stucco, or any combination thereof, except soffits. No vinyl siding shall be permitted except for soffits. 
                  8.  Streets must be at least twenty-two (22) feet in width as measured pursuant to the subdivision ordinance. Curbs and gutters are required. 
                  9.  Paved driveways are required. 
                  10.  Sidewalks are required, on both sides of all streets within any development developed under the standards of this district. Sidewalks must be made of concrete a minimum of four (4) inches in depth and four (4) feet in width and located at least three (3) feet from the backside of the curb so as to provide a buffer between the street and sidewalk. A multi-use path, as described in subsection F.16. of this section, may be substituted for a sidewalk. 
                  11.  Decorative streetlights are required. 
                  12.  Underground utilities are required. 
                  13.  The minimum dwelling size shall be one thousand seven hundred (1,700) square feet of heated floor space for single story dwellings. For multi-story dwellings the minimum dwelling size shall be two thousand two hundred (2,200) square feet of heated floor space. 
                  14.  Alleyways and Alternative Parking. 
                  a.  Private alleyways are required except along the perimeter of the property. Private alleyways shall be located adjacent to, but not in, the rear setback of the lot. Where private alleyways are not provided along the perimeter of the property, the internal street in front of such lots shall have at least an additional ten (10) feet of paved surface for parallel parking in front of said lots for a total minimum street width within the public right-of-way of at least thirty-two (32) feet as measured in accordance with the subdivision ordinance. Said additional paved surface shall meet same construction requirements as set for residential streets under the subdivision ordinance. Parallel parking spaces shall be demarcated every twenty (20) feet. 
                  Approximately every twelve (12) spaces shall be broken by landscaping, and said landscaping shall be located in between dwellings rather directly in front of a dwelling to the greatest extent practicable. Said landscaping area shall be no less than ten (10) feet wide and twenty (20) feet long. 
                  b.  As an alternative to required private alleyways, a developer may request one (1) of the three (3) following alternatives. Such request shall be in writing and shall specify the reasons justifying the request. The request shall be made prior to preliminary plat approval and shall be subject to city council approval, denial, or approval with conditions. 
                  i.  Parallel Parking. City council may allow parallel parking throughout the CRS in lieu of private alleyways. If so approved, all internal streets shall have, in addition to the minimum required width for streets in the subdivision, ten (10) feet of paved surface on both sides of the street for parallel parking, except where all lots on that side of the street have rear access via a private alleyway. Construction and landscaping of said parallel parking areas shall meet the minimum requirements set forth in subsection F.14.a. of this section. 
                  ii.  Designated Parking Areas. City council may allow designated parking areas throughout the CRS in lieu of private alleyways. The minimum number of lots required in designated parking areas shall be at least one (1) parking space for every two (2) dwellings in the CRS. Said parking areas shall be dispersed throughout the CRS and within a reasonable walking distance from the dwellings they are to serve. 
                  iii.  Combination of Alleyways, Parallel Parking and/or Designated Parking Areas. The city council may allow a combination of private alleyways, parallel parking and/or designated parking areas. Alternative parking plans are subject to the review and approval of city council as part of final plat approval. 
                  15.  Residential parking garages are required; however, the maximum coverage of the front facade of any dwelling unit by the garage may be no greater than forty (40) percent; for those residences adjacent to private alleyways, the residential parking garage shall be located in the rear of the main structure with the garage opening facing the alleyway and with a driveway providing access from the private alleyway to the garage. 
                  16.  Multi-use Paths. 
                  a.  Multi-use paths are required. Such paths shall be constructed to connect each residential lot to the largest portion of green space and required amenities located in the subdivision and those commercial, office, and industrial areas inside and outside the subdivision as required in subsection F.16.b. of this section. Multi-use paths may not be constructed in lieu of streets or alleyways; however, private alleyways may be counted towards the multi-use path requirement where at least a ten-foot wide easement is granted for public use and the private alleyway is demarcated according to this subsection. Multi-use paths shall be a minimum of four (4) inches in depth, ten (10) feet in width with demarcations, either by different shaded surfaces or a solid or dashed line, to designate that at least four (4) feet of the width of the path is for pedestrian use and the remaining portion of the width of the path may be used for bicycles and golf carts. Multi-use paths shall be constructed of concrete, asphalt, some pervious material approved by the city or a combination thereof. If pervious material is used, it shall not be a loose material (e.g., wood chips, gravel, sand, or dirt) and it shall have a life span comparable to or better than that of asphalt. 
                  b.  In addition, the landowner or developer shall extend the multi-use path from the subdivision to the nearest commercial area. Upon application by the owner or developer, however, the city reserves the right to reduce, eliminate, or modify this requirement if: (i) the landowner or developer tenders to the city funds equal to the amount which would be expended by the developer to design and construct the multi-use path extension required under this subsection; (ii) the city confirms that the funds deposited will be used for design and construction of a multi-use path benefiting the public at large, consistent with applicable law; (iii) the city votes to accept such funds and exercise the right to reduce, eliminate, or modify the multi-use path requirement in this subsection in a manner and to a degree acceptable to the landowner or developer; (iv) the city places such funds in escrow to be used solely for the purposes outlined in this section; and (v) all documents necessary to satisfy this section are executed, subject to approval by the city attorney as to form. In determining whether to reduce, eliminate, or modify the multi-use path requirement under this subsection, the city shall consider whether doing so will promote public health, safety, and welfare by enabling the public at large to receive a higher quality multi-use path in a more cost-efficient manner.

Begin with one thousand two hundred (1,200) square feet for required building material calculations. A wall area of one thousand two hundred (1,200) square feet shall have no more than six hundred (600) square feet of stucco on the front facade [e.g. (one thousand two hundred (1,200) x fifty (50) percent = six hundred (600))]. The balance shall be brick or other allowed material. Trim or accent material may account for up to ten (10) percent or one hundred twenty (120) square feet. 
                  c.  Roof Requirements. Materials for pitched roofs shall be limited to architectural dimensional grade asphalt shingles, natural slate, natural terra cotta, natural wood shake, copper or factory finished sheet metal. 
                  i.  Pitched roofs. All buildings less than five thousand (5,000) square feet of gross floor area must have a pitched roof with a minimum pitch of 4:12. All one-story buildings less than ten thousand (10,000) gross square feet must have a pitched roof (between 3:12 and 12:12); provided, however, that if a pitched roof is not possible, a combination of flat roof and pitched roof is required. Provide a pitched roof on front and side of the building to screen view of any flat roof. Create arcades, drive-under canopies, porches, and other features with pitched roof. 
                  ii.  Mansard roofs. Mansard roofs shall have a maximum pitch of 12:12 with a minimum twelve-foot vertical surface length. 
                  iii.  Flat roofs. Building materials for flat roofs shall meet local codes. 
                  Exposed metal flashing shall be copper or factory finished sheet metal. If factory finished metal flashing is used, such as standing seam, the color must be subdued to blend with other materials or of a color to simulate weathered copper or bronze. All buildings with flat roofs should include parapet articulation on the front facade(s) of such building. There shall be roof articulations/offsets at a minimum of one (1) per each one hundred twenty-five (125) linear feet of length by a change in the top line of the parapet. Additional articulation may occur at any lesser distance. If the front facade is less than one hundred twenty-five (125) linear feet of length, then a minimum of one (1) roof articulation must occur. 
                  iv.  Other. Drive under canopies for gasoline pumps may have flat roof with vertical or factory formed facing of finished sheet metal. 
                  d.  Arcade/Structural Canopy for Retail Use. For any multitenant commercial development, a covered arcade/structural canopy shall be provided along the front facade of the building. Arcades are covered walkways connected to the principal building. They should be a minimum of five (5) feet in width and designed to provide covered areas for relief from the weather. Different arcade/structural canopy designs may be used for each individual tenant/business within a multitenant commercial development provided that they blend aesthetically with the front facade of the building and has the approval of the building owner and the planning director. 
                  e.  Street Orientation. Principal building entrances shall be oriented to public streets. 
                  f.  Building Height. Any building of which fifty (50) percent or more is located within two hundred fifty (250) feet of the centerline of an arterial street shall be no more than three (3) stories in height. 
                  A relief from height restrictions shall only be allowed if conditional use approval is granted by the zoning advisory board, in accordance with procedures in the Unified Land Development Code. In deciding whether to grant a height increase, the zoning advisory board shall consider the following factors, in addition to those listed in the ULDC: 
                  •  Proximity and relationship of the proposed building to other buildings that are more than three (3) stories or thirty-five (35) feet in height. 
                  •  Impact of the proposed building on single-family residences on nearby tracts.

                  b.  Properties that are adjoining shall be encouraged to enter into an agreement to create space for a connection between the two (2) properties. This keeps traffic off the main road and increases the likelihood that a customer will only have to look for a parking space once if desired. 
                  3.  Landscaping/Buffering. 
                  a.  At least thirty percent (30%) of the paved surface area of each surface parking lot shall be shaded by mature landscaping within five (5) years of construction to provide a cool environment.

                  c.  All areas along the corridor not developed with buildings or prepared surfaces for parking, circulation, utilities or the like, shall be landscaped and maintained with ornamental plantings. These plantings should be native or drought-tolerant plants to minimize the need for irrigation. Green field and wooded areas should be left as is, until developed into another use. Paved areas of the site shall be limited in size to the area required to accommodate the intended use. 
                  4.  Exterior Lighting. 
                  a.  Lighting should be provided at all entrances, pathways, parking areas, and recessed areas. 
                  b.  All exterior lighting fixtures shall use full cutoff luminaires to reduce both energy usage and glare, as well as prevent light pollution.

                  i.  Enclosing the utility within a roof that is integrated into the building form; 
                  ii.  Locating the utility within an enclosed mechanical penthouse whose materials and detailing complement the building architecture; 
                  iii.  Locating the utility far enough from the parapet so as to be effectively invisible from adjacent public rights-of way. 
                  d.  New development shall bury utilities when possible to avoid a visually cluttered streetscape and to promote a more aesthetically pleasing environment.

                  (Ord. No. 18-461, § 1(Exh. A), 4-25-2018) 
                  12.02.110 - Supplemental regulations. 
                  The following standards shall apply to the specified use. 
                  12.19.111 Residential Growth Regulation . 
                  A.  Purpose and Intent. 
                  1.  In addition to the following statements, the preamble of the ordinance codified in this section is incorporated herein by reference. The Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) 2003 Population and Housing Report identifies Henry County as the fastest growing county in the metropolitan Atlanta Region overseen by ARC. Henry County has grown at a rate of seven (7) percent per year between the years 2000 and 2003. Atlanta's burgeoning southeastern population growth follows the path of Interstate 75 through Henry County. The city of Stockbridge is located in unincorporated Henry County along I-75. 
                  2.  According to the report, single-family housing has continued to dominate the market over the past three (3) years while multi-family housing developments have increased at significant rates in particular areas. Areas where multi-family development continues to grow is where land is located outside the perimeter of Interstate 285 and in close proximity and with good accessibility to interstates and highways. The city is located outside the I-285 perimeter and on I-75, Georgia State Highway 42 and Georgia State Highway 138. 
                  3.  As indicated in ARC's report, multi-family growth is occurring in the city at a rapid rate. The report correctly states that as of the close of 2003, the city's housing stock consisted of approximately sixty-eight (68) percent single-family housing, twenty-seven(27) percent multi-family housing and the remaining five (5) percent in the form of mobile homes. These percentages, however, do not reflect the approximately five hundred and seventy-one (571) multi-family units to be developed as a result of rezonings approved in 2003. 
                  4.  To address these growth trends, the mayor and city council wish to take proactive steps to accommodate and control the amount of single-family housing, multi-family housing and mobile home development within its boundaries. Thus, it is the intention of the mayor and city council and purpose of the ordinance codified in this section to encourage continued diversification of residential uses in the city as well as accommodate its fair share of the region's residential growth in a manner consistent with both the proximity of the city to the center of regional growth and the history of residential land uses developed in the city. 
                  B.  Residential Growth Limitation. 
                  1.  Single-family housing, which consists of single-family detached homes in an RA, R-1, R-2, or R-3 zoning classification in the city shall not comprise less than seventy (70) percent of the housing stock. Multi-family housing, which consists of the RM classification regulating apartments (RM-l), townhouses (RM-2), and condominiums (RM-3) and the RD zoning classification regulating duplexes, shall not comprise more than twenty-nine (29) percent of the city housing stock. 
                  Mobile homes built under the RMH or grandfathered RM-75 zoning classifications shall not comprise more than one (1) percent of the city housing stock. 
                  2.  Within the category of single-family housing as described in subsection B.1. of this section, homes built under an R-3 zoning classification shall not exceed thirty (30) percent of the overall single-family housing stock for the city; and the remainder of the single-family housing stock developed under an RA, R-l, and R-2 zoning classification shall not be less than forty (40) percent of the overall single-family housing stock in the city. 
                  C.  Administration. 
                  1.  Housing Inventory. For purposes of determining whether or not a proposed development in the city will violate the residential growth limitations set forth in this section, the development director shall determine the housing inventory for the city. The housing inventory shall be based on the total number of housing units that could be built on land zoned for residential use and in accordance with the particular zoning district regulations applicable to the land. The housing inventory shall then be converted into percentages of single-family, multi-family and mobile homes for determination of compliance with the residential growth limitations set forth in subsection B.1. of this section. Furthermore, the housing inventory for all single-family uses shall be subdivided into percentages of high density single-family and low to medium density single-family use to determine compliance with the residential growth limitations set forth in subsection B.2. of this section. 
                  2.  Quarterly Residential Growth Report. The development director shall document all information required under subsection C.1. of this section in a quarterly residential growth report, and that report shall be presented to the city council at the first meeting of the council for each quarter. Thereafter, the development director shall submit that report to the ZAB. The quarterly residential growth report and the ordinance codified in this section shall be considered by the ZAB and the city council whenever they must respectively recommend or decide any amendment to the zoning ordinance, including the zoning map, use variance and any development agreements entered into for residential development of property in the city. The quarterly residential growth report shall be available to the public in the office of the city clerk. 
                  3.  No proposed rezoning of property for residential use shall be approved unless the potential or actual housing yield for the property will not violate the residential growth limitations set forth in subsection B. of this section, unless the developer agrees to cap the number of units to a level that would not violate this section. 
                  4.  At least once every ten (10) years after adoption of the ordinance codified in this section, the mayor and city council shall reconsider, and adjust if necessary, the residential growth limitations set forth in subsection B. of this section in light of regional and local growth trends and residential development. 
                  5.  This section shall not be construed in any way to limit the authority of the city to annex property in accordance with the laws of the state of Georgia. 
                  D.  Variances. Each quarter the city council shall have the authority to grant variances for up to a maximum of one hundred (100) dwelling units above the residential growth limitations set forth in subsection B. of this section upon a showing of undue hardship in accordance with the criteria set forth under Sec. 11.02.00. Variances of the Zoning Code. No administrative variances to this section shall be granted. 
                  E.  Appeal. 
                  1.  Any person may appeal a quarterly residential growth report within ten (10) calendar days of its presentation to the city council. Such an appeal shall be submitted to the city manager and shall explain the basis for the appeal in writing. Appeals of quarterly residential growth reports shall be heard by the city council at its next regularly scheduled meeting, and a decision shall be made by the city council no later than at the next regularly scheduled council meeting after hearing an appeal. 
                  2.  A decision by the city council made pursuant to this section may be appealed by writ of certiorari to Superior Court of Henry County, Georgia, in accordance with the laws of the state of Georgia. 
                  3.  Any finding of or penalty imposed by the municipal court of the city pursuant to this section may be appealed by writ of certiorari to Superior Court of Henry County, Georgia, in accordance with the laws of the state of Georgia. 
                  F.  Penalty. A violation of the residential growth limitations set forth in subsection B. of this section shall result in a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and/or imprisonment not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days or a combination thereof after a cited person, persons or entity is found guilty or the person, persons or entity pleads guilty or nolo contendere. Violations shall be assessed on a per dwelling unit per day basis. Each violation shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such.

                  12.04.000 - Generally. 
                  12.04.001  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide site design and development standards applicable to both public and private development in the city More specifically, the purposes of the regulations set forth in Chapter 12.04 are to ensure the proper location, height, bulk and size of buildings and other structures; to ensure the proper size of yards and other features of a development site; to ensure the proper layout and design of subdivisions; and to provide for compatibility between proposed and existing development. 
                  12.04.002  Principles of Site Design and Development. 
                  A.  All development shall be designed to avoid unnecessary impervious surface cover, to provide adequate access to lots and sites, to foster compatibility and to ensure site design that is consistent with the standards set forth in Chapter 4. Landscaping, buffering and tree protection standards are applicable to site design and development. 
                  B.  No building or structure shall be constructed, installed, erected or altered except in compliance with the site design and development standards set forth in this Zoning Code. 
                  C.  No open space shall be encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity with the yard, setback, off-street parking, and such other regulations required by this Zoning Code for the zoning district and/or overlay district in which such open space is located. 
                  D.  No part of any yard, other open space, off-street parking or loading space required in connection with any building, structure or use by this Zoning Code shall be considered to be part of a required yard, other open space, off-street parking or loading space for any other building, structure or use, except as explicitly provided in this Zoning Code. 
                  12.04.003  Applicability. 
                  A.  Development standards and site design standards described for a base zoning district in Section 12.02.030 and Section 12.04.010 shall apply to all development within that district. 
                  B.  Where an overlay district applies to a site, the standards for that district, as set forth in Section 12.044.020, shall apply. 
                  C.  In addition to standards for all development within a zoning district, supplemental standards are provided for the MUND zoning district, as well as for specified individual uses. These supplemental standards are set forth in Section 12.04.030. 
                  D.  Where conflict arises between standards required in a base zoning district, an overlay district, supplemental standards, or specific standards for specific situations, the following rules shall be used in application of standards: 
                  1.  Where a master plan, development agreement, or other legally binding document applies to the proposed development, the standards in the legally binding document shall control. 
                  2.  In all other situations, the stricter standard shall control.

                  12.08.020 - Off-street parking and loading requirements. 
                  12.08.021  Purpose and Intent. The intent of Section 12.08.020 to ensure the appropriate location and quantity of off-street parking and loading and to ensure that all developments provide adequate and safe storage and movement of vehicles consistent with generally accepted site design principles. 
                  12.08.022  Applicability. 
                  A.  Except as provided in this section, no application for a building permit shall be approved unless there is included with the plan for such building, improvements, or use, a development plan showing the required space reserved for off-street parking and loading. Occupancy shall not be allowed unless the required off-street parking and loading facilities have been provided in accordance with those shown on the approved plan. 
                  B.  Each use of land and each building or structure hereafter constructed or established, and each addition to a structure shall provide off-street parking and loading according to the standards set forth herein. 
                  C.  When an addition is made to a building containing less than the required parking or loading requirements, off-street parking shall be provided for the entire building, based upon the standards in this section. 
                  D.  No addition to an existing building shall be constructed which reduces the number of spaces, area, or usability of an existing parking lot or loading space, unless such building and its addition conform with the regulations for parking and loading contained herein. 
                  12.08.023  Maintenance. All off-street parking and loading areas shall be well maintained. Parking lots and loading areas shall be free of potholes, debris, weeds, broken curbs, and broken wheel stops. 
                  12.08.024  Calculation of Required Parking Spaces and Loading Spaces. 
                  A.  Table 12.08.025(D) Parking and Loading Space Standards specifies the required minimum number of off-street parking spaces for each listed use. Where the calculation of the required number of spaces results in a fraction, the number shall be rounded up to the next whole number. 
                  B.  Where the unit of measure for determining the number of parking spaces is the number of seats in a facility, the number of seats shall be the maximum occupancy allowed pursuant to building and construction codes. 
                  C.  When multiple uses occupy a building, or a mixed-use development is proposed in separate buildings under unified control, the parking and loading requirement shall be met by each use, unless shared parking is approved according to the standards in Section 12.08.028. 
                  12.08.025  Parking and Loading Space Standards. Table 12.08.025(D) presents standards for parking and loading spaces. Where a use is not listed in Table 12.08.025(D), the development director shall determine the appropriate parking and loading standard. The determination shall be based on the standards for similar uses.

                  12.08.028  Shared Parking Arrangements. 
                  A.  Adjacent uses, multiple uses within a unified development, or establishments with multiple tenants of different uses may provide shared parking facilities. Such shared parking facilities may have a reduced quantity of parking as compared to the sum of parking spaces required for each individual use. 
                  B.  Where shared parking facilities are proposed, the following standards shall be met: 
                  1.  There shall be a paved driveway connection between the adjacent developments such that automobiles may move from one (1) parcel or use to the adjacent parcel or use without exiting to the public street. 
                  2.  There shall be a designated pedestrian connection from all uses to the shared parking facility. 
                  3.  The owners of developments involved shall execute a cross-access and cross-parking agreement, provided in a recordable instrument, acceptable to the city. The agreement shall guarantee the joint use of a specified number of parking spaces. 
                  4.  The number of spaces in the shared parking facility shall be determined by one (1) of the methods in subsection 12.08.28.C below. 
                  C.  The calculation of required spaces in a shared parking facility shall use one (1) of the two (2) methods described below: 
                  1.  A parking study may be conducted to provide evidence of the combined parking requirements of the proposed uses. 
                  a.  The study shall be prepared by a professional engineer with documented traffic expertise. 
                  b.  The study shall include estimates of parking requirements based on professionally accepted data or studies, such as from the Institute of Traffic Engineers, Urban Land Institute, or other sources acceptable to the city. 
                  c.  Parking requirements shall be based on uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed uses. Comparability shall be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location in relationship to other uses and the transportation system. 
                  d.  Parking requirements shall be based upon peak hours of need for each use proposed to share parking facilities. The hours of maximum, or peak, parking demand of the respective developments shall not overlap. 
                  e.  The study shall document the source(s) of data used to develop recommendations. 
                  f.  The study shall document the extent to which transportation system management and alternative forms of transportation (pedestrian and bicycle) reduce the parking requirement. 
                  g.  The study shall document the availability of off-site parking to meet a portion of the parking requirements. Off-site parking shall not be located more than one hundred fifty (150) feet from the uses that require parking. The study shall be accompanied by documentation to demonstrate the continued availability of the off-site parking, such as easements or other recordable instruments. 
                  2.  Shared parking may also be determined by the following method: 
                  a.  Calculate the parking requirement for each proposed use, as set forth in Table 12.08.25(D). 
                  b.  Multiply each amount by the corresponding percentages from Table 12.08.028(C) for each of the five (5) time periods. 
                  c.  Total the amount of parking for each time period. 
                  d.  The highest parking requirement shall be the minimum number of spaces required for the shared use facilities.

The director of community development/planning and zoning may authorize a reduction in the total number of parking spaces constructed on a site to no less than ninety percent (90%) of the basic requirement when all of following conditions are met: The request for reduction in parking shall show that the reduction is justified on the basis of characteristics unique to the specific proposed use of the property in contrast to the characteristics of other uses within the same category. 
                  A.  Adequate land area for meeting the basic parking requirement is located on and designed for the site whether at grade or in parking decks. The unconstructed portion of the parking shall be clearly delineated and labeled "Future Parking" on the site plan. 
                  B.  Prior to granting the reduction in total parking spaces constructed, the director of community development/planning and zoning shall conclude that the reduction is justified, and shall approve, in whole or in part, or deny the request stating the reasons therefore in the report. 
                  C.  If the director of community development/planning and zoning finds that the parking reduction is no longer justified, the director shall notify the owner to construct the number of parking spaces necessary to meet the required level. 
                  D.  Prior to any change in ownership or use, the owner must apply to the director of community development/planning and zoning for an evaluation and confirmation of the reduction.

                  12.11.000 - Generally. 
                  This chapter establishes procedures for obtaining relief from the provisions of this Zoning Code where hardship would otherwise occur. Section 11.01.00 addresses hardships that may impact owners of nonconforming lots, structures or uses in the event immediate compliance with this Zoning Code were required. Sections 11.02.00 and 11.03.00 address hardships that may occur in a particular situation due to characteristics of the land to be developed based on the site design standards of this Zoning Code.

                  12.11.011  Generally. 
                  A.  Lots, structures or uses that were lawfully established prior to adoption of this Zoning Code, but which do not comply with the requirements set forth in this Zoning Code, are considered legal, nonconforming lots, structures or uses. 
                  B.  The intent of Section 12.11.010 is to allow such nonconformities to continue until they are removed or abandoned. The intent of this section is also to ensure that nonconformities shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for creating lots, or adding structures or uses prohibited in a particular zoning district. 
                  C.  Nonconforming uses are hereby declared incompatible with uses permitted in the zoning district in which the nonconforming use is located. 
                  D.  Nothing in Section 12.11.010 shall be construed to prevent the ordinary and routine maintenance and repair of nonconforming structures, or structures that contain nonconforming uses, provided the following circumstances exist: 
                  1.  Repairs do not exceed ten (10) percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming portion of the structure during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months; and 
                  2.  The cubic area of the structure is not increased. 
                  E.  A structure damaged by any means to an extent more than fifty (50) percent of replacement cost at the time of the occurrence shall be rebuilt only in conformity with this Zoning Code.

                  G.  A structure damaged by any means to an extent less than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value may be restored and occupied as before the damage, provided the following condition is met: 
                  1.  Restoration shall be commenced within six (6) months from the date damages were incurred. 
                  Rebuilding and use of the land or structure not commenced within six (6) months shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this Zoning Code. 
                  H.  A nonconforming structure, or a structure containing a nonconforming use, declared by the development director to be physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
                  12.11.012  Nonconforming Lots of Record. 
                  A.  A single family dwelling and permitted accessory structures may be built on a single lot of record in any zoning district in which single family dwellings are permitted, subject to the following conditions: 
                  1.  The lot of record was established on or before the effective date of this Zoning Code; 
                  2.  The lot of record is held in separate ownership from adjacent lots with continuous frontage on the same street;

                  A.  A variance may be granted where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Code will in an individual case result in unnecessary hardship. 
                  B.  A variance shall observe the spirit of this Zoning Code, secure public safety and welfare, and deliver substantial justice. 
                  C.  The existence of a nonconforming use on adjacent or nearby property shall not constitute a justification for granting a variance.

                  7.  No curb and gutter for subdivisions in the RA zoning district. 
                  Requests other than those stated above will constitute a request to amend that section of this Zoning Code for which compliance cannot be reasonably achieved through procedures set forth by subsection 12.12.0211. 
                  12.11.023  Criteria to Be Considered for Deciding Variances. A variance may be granted only upon a finding by the mayor and council that all the following conditions are met: 
                  A.  Extraordinary and exceptional circumstances pertaining to the particular piece of property in question exist due its size, shape, or topography that are not found on other properties in the same zoning district; 
                  B.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning Code would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by owners of other properties located in the same zoning district; 
                  C.  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property owner any special privileges that are denied to other owners of property in the same zoning district; 
                  D.  The variance will be consistent with the purposes and intent of this Zoning Code, will be compatible with uses on neighboring properties, and will serve the public welfare; 
                  E.  The extraordinary circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant; 
                  F.  The variance is the minimum relief that will allow the legal use of the land, building or structure; and 
                  G.  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures that is prohibited in the same zoning district.

                  A.  The purpose of the pre-application conference is to provide an opportunity for the applicant to consult with city staff for advice and assistance prior to preparation of a preliminary plat, development plan, and zoning application. This will enable the applicant to become familiar with the approval process, required documents, inspections, the comprehensive plan, infrastructure and improvement standards adopted by the City of Stockbridge and development factors that may affect the proposed development. 
                  B.  The intent of this Zoning Code is that all procedural and development requirements be identified during the pre-application conference. However, no person may rely upon any comment concerning a proposed development, or any expression of any nature about the proposal, made by a participant at the pre-application conference, as a representation or implication that the proposal will be ultimately approved or rejected in any form. Additionally, failure of a participant to identify any applicable requirement or condition shall not preclude the city from requiring an applicant to comply with such requirement or condition. 
                  The applicant shall provide the following information: 
                  1.  The City of Stockbridge application for zoning.

                  Definitions: 
                  For the purposes of this Zoning Code in addition to their common meanings certain words and terms used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be defined and interpreted as follows. The use of the singular includes the plural and the plural the singular; the present tense includes the future; the use of "shall" means the action is mandatory, the use of "may" or "should" means the action is optional. Any masculine pronoun shall be deemed to refer to a person, whether male or female. 
                  To the extent the definition of a term defined herein conflicts with the definition of such term as defined elsewhere in the Stockbridge Municipal Code, the definition in the existing Stockbridge Municipal Code show govern. All terms not defined herein shall be defined as elsewhere in the Stockbridge Municipal Code. Terms not found in the Stockbridge Municipal Code shall be defined as in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  A 
                  Abandoned cemetery. A cemetery which shows signs of neglect including, without limitation, the unchecked growth of vegetation, repeated and unchecked acts of vandalism, or the disintegration of grave markers or boundaries and for which no person can be found who is legally responsible and financially capable of the upkeep of such cemetery. 
                  Accessory apartment (garage apartment). See accessory dwelling. 
                  Accidental discharge. A discharge prohibited by this ordinance which occurs by chance and without planning or thought prior to occurrence. 
                  Activity center. An activity center is an area that includes office, retail, service, residential or civic uses that create a central focus for a larger area. An activity center also has generally recognizable boundaries. 
                  (1)  Crossroads. A small node at a major intersection or crossroad in rural or estate residential community that provides local needs along with a sense of place. The crossroads activity center includes a nucleus comprised of one (1) or more of the following elements: a church, community center, cemetery or other civic/historic landmark, recreation center, restaurant, gas station, or small store with convenient commercial services used on a daily basis for local residents that frequently pass by. The design of the crossroads community center should take into consideration how it could be expanded as the population grows in the surrounding area. The node may be served by septic tanks. 
                  (2)  School node. For many county residents, the local school and in particular the local school cluster where one (1) or more schools are co-located, serves as a major center and focus of activity. This type of center is designed to compliment this type of lifestyle. Being predominately residential in its composition, it will also include neighborhood oriented commercial areas as well as recreational areas ideally linked by a network of multiuse trails and sidewalks. The center should extend a reasonable walking or cycling distance from the schools or approximately a mile from the core. 
                  (3)  Specialty use center. This type activity center is truly unique and unlike the other centers is usually dominated by one (1) major large-scale use. The best example in the county is the Atlanta International Motor Speedway. A specialty use center often has its own unique transportation needs, and in many ways serves a showcase for the community. Special attention should be given to preserving and enhancing the function of the focal point of this type of center. 
                  (4)  Suburban employment center. An activity center located around one (1) or more of the county's interstate interchanges. The core of the center would be largely commercial and included a wide range of retail, commercial and service uses. This type of center would include such uses as office buildings, major commercial centers, large civic facilities, and a wide variety of housing types. Large-scale mixed-use developments are also appropriate here. The center should extend a half mile or more on one (1) or both sides of the interstate. Being located close to the interstate, the most prominent gateway to the county, the design of the center and the buildings within it should pay special attention to the viewshed from the interstate. 
                  (5)  Village node. This type of center would have at its core a compact and well-organized commercial and civic core built along a formal gridded, interconnected street network. The center will include a full array of "life-cycle" housing choices and provide cultural and passive recreational opportunities. The village center will have its own unique identity, enforced by common design themes used for public facilities and spaces. The village center should also be relatively self-contained providing most of everyday services needed by village residents.

                  Administrative waiver. A grant of relief by the administrator from specified standards of the Zoning Code and where such a waiver will not be contrary to the public interest and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the property and not the result of the actions of the applicant, a literal enforcement of the chapter would result in unnecessary and undue hardship. 
                  Administrator. The person, officer, official, or his authorized representative designated by the mayor and council, city of Stockbridge, as its agent for the administration of the provisions of the Zoning Code.

                  Addition to an existing building. Any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a fire wall or is separated by an independent perimeter load-bearing wall shall be considered new construction. 
                  Adult entertainment establishment. Any establishment featuring live performances, films, still pictures, electronic reproductions, or video with graphic or other visual images distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on sexual conduct or sexual explicit nudity. Adult entertainment establishments include, but are not limited to, adult bookstores, adult dance establishments, adult motion picture arcades, adult movie theaters, and adult video stores. 
                  Agriculture. Cultivating the soil, producing crops and raising of livestock (farming, and associated activities) upon one (1) or more tracts of land containing not less than three (3) acres. Selling of products raised on the premises shall be considered a permissible activity; provided, that space for the off-county right-of-way parking is available to customers.

                  Airport. Any area of land or water designed and set aside for the landing and taking off of aircraft. The term may include facilities for refueling, repair, handling, and storage of aircraft or facilities for passengers and freight.
