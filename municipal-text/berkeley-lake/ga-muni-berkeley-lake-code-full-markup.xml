         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Berkeley Lake, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2004 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2004 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

                  Editor's note— Part I of this volume contains the Charter of the City of Berkeley Lake, Georgia, which consists of the local law enacted by the Georgia General Assembly as 1999 Ga. Laws (Act No. 46), page 3636. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

In addition to all other taxes or license fees heretofore or hereafter imposed upon retail dealers engaged in the city in the business of selling alcoholic beverages, malt beverages and/or wine, there is imposed and levied upon all hereinafter described dealers within the city an excise tax to be computed and collected as hereinafter set forth.

                  (2)  Any sale of wine which is exempt from taxation by the state or under the Constitution of the United States; 
                  (3)  Wine sold to persons outside the state for resale or consumption outside the state; or 
                  (4)  Wines or malt beverages which contain less than one-half of one percent alcohol by volume. 
                  (b)  Basis for computation of tax . 
                  (1)  The tax levied hereunder shall be computed on the basis of $0.22 per liter of spirituous liquors and wine sold or delivered as hereinafter set forth. The $0.22 per liter shall be pro-rated down on fractional parts of liters, so that each bottle or each individual size container shall be taxed on the basis of $0.22 per liter. It shall be unlawful and a violation of this article for any such licensee to possess, own, hold, store, display or sell any liquor or wine on which such tax has not been paid. 
                  (2)  Where malt beverages, commonly known as tap or draft beer, are sold from a barrel or bulk container, the tax levied hereunder shall be computed at the rate of $6.00 on each container sold containing not more than 15½ gallons and a proportionate tax at the same rate on all fractional parts of 15½ gallons; where malt beverages are sold in bottles, cans or other containers except barrel or bulk containers, a tax of five cents per 12 ounces and a proportionate tax at the same rate on all fractional parts of 12 ounces shall be imposed.

                  (1)  Keep and maintain true and correct records of all sales, shipments or deliveries of spirituous liquors and wine and malt beverages to each retail dealer in the city. Such records are to be preserved for a period of not less than one year and made available on request for the inspection of any duly authorized representative of the city. 
                  (2)  Collect from each retail dealer in the city at time of delivery of spirituous liquors or wine or malt beverages, the amount of tax due under the terms of this section and hold the same in trust for the city until such tax is remitted to the city as herein provided. 
                  (3)  On or before the tenth day of each calendar month, each wholesaler shall make a verified and comprehensive report to the city which shall correctly show and reflect all sales and deliveries of alcoholic beverages to or for retail dealers in the city for the calendar month immediately preceding the date of said report. Said report shall show the name and address of each retail dealer, the quantities delivered to each retail dealer, the amount of excise tax collected under the terms of this section, and such other reasonable information as may be requested by the city. Said report shall be accompanied by remittance payable to the city for all taxes collected or due, as shown on said report. 
                  (4)  The excise tax levied in this section is hereby levied upon the retailer licensed to do business in the city and it is the intent of this article to so levy this tax as to require the payment of the tax at the time of delivery by the retailer to the wholesaler, who shall have the responsibility of remitting the tax to the city on behalf of the retailer on or before the tenth day of each calendar month, as hereinbefore required. In the event the tax due hereunder is not paid on or before the tenth day of each calendar month, a ten percent penalty on the gross tax will be levied by the city against each defaulting retailing licensee for whom the tax is not paid on or before the tenth day of the month. 
                  (d)  Noncompliance by wholesale dealer; distributor . If any wholesale dealer or distributor fails or refuses to make the reports required herein, the city shall notify such dealer or distributor in writing and if the reports are not made and the taxes are not remitted within five days from the date of such notice, such wholesale dealer or distributor shall be prohibited from making any further deliveries in the city and the retail licenses served by such wholesale dealer or distributor for whom the taxes have not been paid shall be subject to having their license suspended or revoked as herein provided. 
                  (e)  Unlawful retail sales . It shall be a violation of this article for any person, firm, or corporation to sell at retail within the city alcoholic beverages, malt beverages or wine on which the taxes herein provided for have not been paid. 
                  (f)  Unlawful deliveries . It shall be unlawful and a violation of this article for any wholesale dealer or distributor to deliver any alcoholic beverages, malt beverages or wine to any retail dealer in the city without at the time of such delivery collecting the excise taxes herein provided for. 
                  (g)  Violations and penalties . Any person violating any of the provisions of this article or who shall assist any retail dealer in alcoholic beverages or wine or malt beverages in the city to evade or avoid the payment of the taxes herein provided for shall be guilty of a violation of this section and on conviction thereof in the municipal court shall be fined or sentenced as provided by this article and any such person so convicted shall also be subject to having his license suspended or revoked.

                  (a)  In addition to all other taxes or license fees imposed upon retail dealers engaged in the sale of distilled spirits by the drink there is imposed an excise tax upon the sale of said drinks in the amount of three percent of the total cost of such drink which is charged to the public. Such taxes shall be collected by the licensee under this chapter and any such licensees shall remit the same to the clerk of the city on or before the tenth day of the succeeding month along with the appropriate returns showing a summary of the licensee's gross sales derived from the sale of distilled spirits by the drink. Gross sales shall include all credit card sales and those sales shall be reported and taxes collected thereon shall be submitted to the city clerk to the same extent as required of cash sales. It shall be the duty of each licensee required to make a report and pay any tax levy hereunder to keep and preserve suitable records of the sales taxable under this section, and such other books or accounts as may be necessary to determine the amount of the tax due. It shall be the duty of every licensee to keep and preserve such records for a period of three years and to provide such returns and reports as may be required by the city clerk. Licensees collecting the tax provided for in this section shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting and paying the amount due, if the amount is not delinquent at the time of payment. The rate of deduction should be the same rate authorized for deductions from state tax under Chapter 8 of Title 48 as provided in O.C.G.A. § 3-4-133. If the tax due is unpaid by the twentieth day of the succeeding month, there shall be imposed a penalty of ten percent of the tax due or $25.00, whichever amount is greater, and interest of one percent of the total due for each month or portion thereof that payment remains delinquent. The city clerk is hereby authorized to create such reports and returns as may be necessary to adequately provide for the collection of the excise tax provided in this section. 
                  (b)  In the event the city clerk deems it necessary to verify the excise tax submitted to the city pursuant to this section, for any month, he or she shall notify the licensee of such need for verification and the licensee shall submit a verified comprehensive report to the city clerk, prepared by an auditor, reflecting all sales under this section by the licensee and the taxes submitted to the city. The licensee shall have 30 days to submit such a report to the city clerk following such a request.

                  (c)  Whenever the state shall revoke any license to sell alcoholic beverages, the city license shall thereupon be automatically revoked. The city clerk shall take the necessary steps to see that signs are removed and that all alcoholic beverage sales cease. 
                  (d)  Any material omission from or untrue or misleading information which is contained in an original, renewal or transfer application for a license shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, and if any license has previously been granted under such circumstances, the same shall constitute due cause for revocation of such license. Any failure to notify of the change in any relationship as specified in section 6-135 (change in relationships and/or ownership interest) within 30 days within such change is made shall likewise constitute due cause for cancellation, revocation or suspension of a license issued hereunder. Further, failure to pay all fees, taxes or other charges imposed under the provisions of this article shall constitute due cause for cancellation, revocation or suspension of a license issued hereunder.

                  (i)  In the case of an act of an employee, rather than the licensee, which presents cause for the suspension or revocation of a license, in determining whether to initiate such suspension or revocation hearings, the city clerk may take into consideration any documented evidence that the licensee has, on prior occasions, undertaken proactive efforts to promote compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including the provisions of this chapter prohibiting the sale or serving of alcohol to minors. Documented evidence of such activities shall include, but shall not be limited to, written evidence that the licensee has promptly reported freely and of its own volition violations or attempted violations of this chapter.

                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, chapter 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (d)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer shall cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated and closed, or demolished within 270 days of the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (e)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (f)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (g)  The lien provided for in subsection (e) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court in Gwinnett County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (a). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within 90 days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
                  (h)  It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. title 48, chapter 4, article 5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure, shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The tax commissioner may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (i)  The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality whose ordinance is being enforced. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (j)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (k)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  (2)  At least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing, the public officer shall mail copies of the complaint and summons by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, to all interested parties whose identities and addresses are readily ascertainable. Copies of the complaint and summons shall also be mailed by first-class mail to the property address to the attention of the occupants, if any; 
                  (3)  For interested parties whose mailing address is unknown, a notice stating the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements appear in such county once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the hearing; and 
                  (4)  A notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court in which the dwelling, building, structure, or property is located at the time of filing the complaint in municipal court. 
                  (b)  The public officer shall cause an affidavit of service to be filed of record in the municipal court prior to the hearing showing compliance with the service requirements of this section. Such affidavit shall constitute a prima facie showing of minimum procedural due process and shall constitute sufficient proof that service was perfected. 
                  (c)  Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this section on every interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings.

                  (a)  The mayor and council find: 
                  (1)  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. 
                  (2)  Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer. 
                  (b)  Accordingly, the mayor and council find and declare that the purposes of this article are: 
                  (1)  To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and public and private places of employment; 
                  (2)  To guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air; and 
                  (3)  To recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

Such notice shall be served at least two days prior to the date set for the hearing by the OEO, and shall be made either personally or by leaving a copy at the party's most notorious place of abode. A copy of such notice shall also be mailed to the complainant. 
                  (3)  Order of abatement.

                  (c)  Prohibited. It shall be a violation of this article for any person to write, paint or draw, carve or scratch upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, signage, and other structure, tree, and other real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing, inscription, figure or mark of the type which is commonly known and referred to as graffiti within the city without permission from the city. 
                  (d)  Violation. A violation of any of the provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine of up to $1,000.00 and a jail term of up to 60 days. Each day a violation occurs shall be considered a separate and distinct violation.

                  (2)  The notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall be a written notice to be served upon the owner of the affected premises, as such owner's name and address appears on the last property tax assessment rolls of the county.

                  a.  By personal service on the owner, occupant or manager of the property; or 
                  b.  By registered or certified mail addressed to the owner at the last known address of said owner. If this address is unknown, the notice will be sent to the property address. 
                  (f)  City costs enforceable as a lien. Any and all costs incurred by the city in the abatement of the graffiti nuisance as provided in this section shall constitute a debt owed to the city by the property owner and shall be enforceable as a lien against the property upon which such nuisance existed, in addition to the other legal remedies available for enforcement of debts. 
                  (g)  Removal by city. Upon failure of persons to comply with the notice by the designated date, or such continued date thereafter as the OEO approves, then the graffiti may be abated by city forces or by private contractor, and the city or its private contractor is expressly authorized to enter the premises for such purposes during regular business hours or at times mutually agreeable with the property owner or occupant.

                  Sec. 26-224. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
                  (a)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  (1)  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  (2)  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and, 
                  (3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city building inspector are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (b)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  (1)  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  (2)  24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  (3)  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (c)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (b), is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  (d)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24 hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  (e)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from city building inspector before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city building inspector may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  (1)  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (f)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (a), above. The applicant may, if approved by the city building inspector, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (g)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public right-of-ways.

                  Sec. 32-51. - Purposes. 
                  (a)  To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure. 
                  (b)  To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land. 
                  (c)  To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat. 
                  (d)  To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development. 
                  (e)  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development. 
                  (f)  To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community. 
                  (g)  To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions.

                  (i)  To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries. 
                  (j)  To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles. 
                  (k)  To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space. 
                  (l)  To preserve important historic and archaeological sites. 
                  (Ord. No. O-53-07, § 1, 5-17-2007)

                  (b)  Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility. 
                  (c)  Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the local jurisdiction: 
                  (1)  Calculation: The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel: 
                  a.  Slopes over 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area;

The license of such deceased person shall be held by the administrator, executor or personal representative of such deceased person only for the time necessary to complete execution of his estate and dispose of the license or his interest therein, but in no event to exceed eight (8) months.

                  (e)  Should a transfer of the license be approved, there shall be no prorated return of any license fee and the new licensee shall meet all requirements for a new license to be issued hereunder, except payment of license fees.

                  DIVISION 4. - MEDIA PRODUCTION 

                  Sec. 34-120. - Purpose. 
                  It is the public policy of the State of Georgia to market the state as a location for media productions, recognizing the economic impact this industry provides for local jurisdictions, such as the City of Berkeley Lake. The city is further fortunate to have a number of unique locations to attract media productions to the city. 
                  Despite the many positive benefits a media production may offer, certain inconveniences may result if the production company and city cannot work in concert to assure minimum standards are met and to assure a thoroughly-planned production schedule is followed. The motion picture, television, internet and other media industries can be environmentally clean industries, desirable for the city so long as there is adequate regulation to protect the health, safety and well-being of the local community, atmosphere and environment.

                  (1)  Low-impact activities are generally those activities having an intended duration of no more than seven consecutive days, with little or no disruption to normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby properties and uses; but excluding activities requiring more than 35 total personnel or 35 vehicles, or utilizing more than one property site.

                  Sec. 42-22. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsections (16) and (17) of this section, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-5(6), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-2, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  In addition to the provisions of this article, the provisions of article VIII of this chapter shall also apply with respect to stream buffers. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 42-23. - Application; permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The City of Berkeley Lake shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Berkeley Lake without first obtaining a permit from the city administrator or designee to perform such activity and providing a copy of Notice of Intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city administrator or designee and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 42-22(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 42-22(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 42-22(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 42-22(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6), are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Berkeley Lake are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by the local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7-(f)(1).

                  Sec. 42-24. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  The city administrator or designee will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (a)  The local issuing authority shall amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (b)  The city administrator or designee shall have the power to conduct such investigations as he or she may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (c)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the Commission, the district, or Division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 42-23(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)  Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Sec. 42-60. - Article adopted. 
                  This article is adopted pursuant to the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-453.

                  Sec. 42-61. - Findings. 
                  The city council finds that: 
                  (1)  The Chattahoochee River provides multiple public benefits, which include use of the river as the primary water supply for metropolitan Atlanta. 
                  (2)  The water quality of the Chattahoochee River depends upon the waste quality of the flowing streams tributary to the river. 
                  (3)  Sediment and other polluting materials and conditions, including but not limited to pesticides, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, toxic materials, and elevations in water temperature are harmful to the water quality of the river and its tributaries. 
                  (4)  The riparian vegetation along these watercourses helps preserve water quality, dense tree growth helps to prevent stream bank erosion, and streamside vegetation reduces the amount of sediment and other polluting materials that would otherwise wash into streams. Riparian trees, by shading, help maintain cooler water temperatures and thus enhance water quality.

                  The purposes of this article are: 
                  (1)  To promote the public health and general welfare; 
                  (2)  To minimize public and private losses due to erosion and water pollution; and 
                  (3)  To maintain stream water quality in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  a.  Create vegetative buffer areas adjacent to tributary streams in the drainage area of the Chattahoochee Corridor. 
                  b.  Minimize land disturbing activities within such buffer areas by requiring issuance of a permit for such activities.

                  --- (3) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. O-167-14, § 1, adopted May 15, 2014, repealed the former article II, §§ 42-92—42-99, and enacted a new article II as set out herein. The former article II pertained to floodplain management and derived from Ordinance No. O-41-06. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

                  Sec. 42-92. - Findings. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Berkeley Lake are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
                  (3)  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: 
                  a.  Protect human life and health; 
                  b.  Minimize damage to private property; 
                  c.  Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and 
                  d.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  (4)  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Berkeley Lake, Georgia, does ordain this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.

                  Sec. 42-93. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
                  (b)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Berkeley Lake. 
                  (c)  Designation of ordinance administrator. The building inspector or designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
                  (d)  Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard, areas of future-conditions flood hazard and associated floodplain characteristics—Flood area maps and studies. For the purposes of defining and determining "Areas of Special Flood Hazard," "Areas of Future-conditions Flood Hazard," "Areas of Shallow Flooding," "Base Flood Elevations," "Floodplains," "Floodways," "Future-conditions Flood Elevations," "Future-conditions Floodplains," potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRM maps, and other terms used in this article, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto: 
                  (1)  The flood insurance study (FIS) for Gwinnett County and Incorporated Areas, dated March 4, 2013, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto. 
                  (2)  Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the base or one-percent (100-year) floodplain and flood-prone areas, including: 
                  a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the City of Berkeley Lake; and 
                  b.  Any base flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA approved methodology and approved by the city engineer. 
                  (3)  Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the future-conditions flood elevation or delineation of the future-conditions floodplain and flood-prone areas, including: 
                  a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the City of Berkeley Lake; and

                  (4)  The repository for public inspection of the FIS, accompanying maps and other supporting data is located at Berkeley Lake City Hall. 
                  (e)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, easement, covenant, deed restriction or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (f)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
                  (g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of Berkeley Lake or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

                  Structure means a walled and roofed building (including a gas or liquid storage tank), that is principally above ground, or a manufactured home. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This term also includes repetitive loss. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement to a structure, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means: 
                  (1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or 
                  (2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the code enforcement officer. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the requirements of this article. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
                  b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
                  c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
                  d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (less than 0.01 foot), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of subsection 42-96(d); 
                  e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and 
                  f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the city engineer using the FEMA community concurrence forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of development, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys and plans for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). 
                  (d)  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the city engineer prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  (1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  (2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the city engineer. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
                  (4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
                  (e)  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below. 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city) until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the City of Berkeley Lake. 
                  (f)  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. The city engineer may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the city.

                  (4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (7)  In reviewing such requests, planning and zoning commission and mayor and council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (8)  Conditions for variances: 
                  a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  i.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  ii.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  iii.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  b.  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
                  c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided. 
                  d.  The city clerk shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the federal emergency management agency upon request. 
                  (9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the planning and zoning commission and mayor and council shall deem necessary for the consideration of the request.

                  (b)  Exemptions. The following activities shall be exempt from the provisions of this article: 
                  (1)  The removal of trees on public rights-of-way conducted by, on behalf of, or any activity pursuant to work to be dedicated to a federal, state, county, municipal or other governmental agency in pursuance of its lawful activities or functions in the construction or improvement of public right-of-way. 
                  (2)  Horticultural and agricultural operations . 
                  a.  All plant or tree nurseries and botanical gardens shall be exempt from the terms and provisions of this article in relation to those trees which are being grown for relocation and continued growth in the ordinary case of business, or for some public purpose. 
                  b.  All orchards of trees in active commercial operation shall be exempt from the terms and provisions of this article for bona fide agricultural purposes only. 
                  (3)  Tree thinning. The thinning of trees (selective cutting only) solely for the purpose of good forestry management, may be permitted upon authorization by the OEO and shall require the submittal and approval of a tree preservation/replacement plan. Permits authorizing tree thinning shall be limited to the following: 
                  a.  A 75-foot natural undisturbed buffer (not a zoning buffer) shall be provided and maintained along the entire perimeter of the property, including road frontages, during the land disturbing activity, except for authorized road crossings. 
                  b.  The property shall be required to meet a tree density standard of 40 units per acre upon completion of authorized land disturbing activities. 
                  c.  The owner/developer shall utilize the recommended best management practices (BMPs) as established by the Georgia Forestry Commission.

                  Sec. 42-268. - Developed residential lots. 
                  Regardless of the number of TDUs existing on the property, healthy trees removed from developed single-family residential lots under an approved tree removal permit and tree replacement plan must be replaced with the equivalent TDUs based on the values contained in section 42-269, Table B by any combination of planting new trees on site or approved alternative compliance methods as set out in section 42-271, subject to the minimum standards set forth in section 42-269. Should a property not meet the minimum standards at the time of permit application, it shall maintain on site the same tree density as before removal and no fewer than two trees, whether planted or preserved. Specimen trees shall be replaced with two times their TDU value as required by subsection 42-270(d). 
                  Unless exempt from the provisions of this article or otherwise excluded pursuant to subsection 42-266(c), trees removed from developed residential lots but not part of a tree removal permit and replacement plan shall also be replaced with two times their TDU equivalent. The OEO shall issue a citation to the responsible party to appear in municipal court for removal of trees without the appropriate tree removal permit. 
                  (Ord. No. O-117-10, 10-21-2010; Ord. No. O-172-14, § 1, 8-21-2014) 
                  Sec. 42-269. - Minimum tree density requirements. 
                  (a)  Overview. A basic requirement of this article is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of 40 units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area (a standard forest inventory measurement), and is not synonymous with "tree". 
                  The density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development, except as otherwise stated for single-family residential lots. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two as represented by the formula: 
                  SDF = EDF + RDF 
                  Where: 
                  SDF (Site Density Factor) = The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (40 units per acre). 
                  EDF (Existing Density Factor) = Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site. 
                  RDF (Replacement Density Factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site. 
                  (b)  Site density factor. The site density factor (SDF) is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 40. Example: A 2.2 acre site has a SDF of 2.2 × 40 = 88. 
                  (c)  Existing density factor . The existing density factor (EDF) is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor units. This is done using Table A below. 
                  Table A. Credit for existing trees     Conversion from tree diameter in inches to tree density units for trees remaining on site 

                   
                  Note: Tree diameter for existing trees is measured at 4.5 feet above the ground. Tree diameter fractions may be "rounded up" if 0.5 inches or greater, or "rounded down" if less than 0.5 inches. 
                  Example: 
                  A total of 15 trees will remain on the 2.2 acre site. The tree inventory is as follows: 
                  7—12″ diameter maples 
                  3—14″ diameter gums 
                  3—18″ diameter pines 
                  1—21″ diameter oak 
                  1—30″ diameter oak 
                  Converting diameters (DBH) to density units, the EDF is determined as shown in the following table: 

                   
                  (d)  Replacement density factor . 
                  (1)  Calculate the replacement density factor (RDF) by subtracting the EDF from the SDF. 
                  Example: RDF = 70.4 - 43.2 = 27.2 
                  The density factor credit for each caliper size of replacement (new) trees is shown in Table B. Any number or combination of transplantable size trees can be used so long as their total density factor units will equal or exceed the RDF and the species list is accepted by the OEO. 
                  (2)  All replacement trees shall be selected from either the city-maintained canopy tree list or understory tree list.

                  Sec. 42-270. - Specimen trees. 
                  (a)  Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. The following criteria are used by the OEO or city arborist to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition must be met for a tree to qualify. 
                  (1)  Overstory trees such as oaks, hickories, poplars, sweet gums or other large hardwoods must be at least 28 inches in diameter at breast height to be considered a specimen tree. 
                  (2)  Small native flowering trees must be at least 12 inches in diameter at breast height to be considered a specimen tree. 
                  (3)  Softwood trees such as pines must be at least 30 inches in diameter at breast height to be considered a specimen tree. 
                  (4)  Condition criteria. 
                  a.  Life expectancy of greater than 15 years. 
                  b.  Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay. 
                  c.  No more than one major and several minor dead limbs. 
                  d.  No major insect or pathological problems. 
                  e.  No major pruning deficiencies, i.e. topping. 
                  f.  At least 75 percent of the critical root zone in a natural, undisturbed state. 
                  g.  Native flowering tree if considered a rare species. 
                  (b)  On all sites, it is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to, alternate building design, building location, parking area layout, parking area location, water retention location and the like. 
                  (c)  In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be two times the assigned value shown in Table A in section 42-269(c). 
                  (d)  On all sites, if a specimen tree must be removed, it shall be replaced by a species with potential for comparable size and quality. All specimen trees removed must be replaced at a density of two times the unit value of the tree removed, i.e., 30-inch diameter specimen trees (9.8 density units) must be replaced with 19.6 units. Species selection is subject to the approval of the OEO or city arborist. 
                  (e)  No specimen tree may be removed without prior written approval from the OEO. Any specimen tree which is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the OEO must be replaced by trees with a minimum caliper size of five inches per tree with a total density equal to three times the unit value of the tree removed. The area that encompassed the critical root zone of the specimen tree shall remain undisturbed to allow for the planting of replacement trees. In addition, the OEO may issue a citation for the removal of a specimen tree without the appropriate city review and approval. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval. 
                  (f)  On all sites except single family detached residential lots, the OEO or city arborist may identify and require the preservation of a tree stand if it contains one or more specimen tree and the trees are interlocked with other members of the stand in such a manner as to imperil the individual tree if other members of the stand were to be removed.

                  Sec. 42-271. - Alternative compliance. 
                  (a)  Generally. The intent of this article is to insure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required density of trees. In this case, the OEO may approve placement or replacement on another property, either private or public, or monetary compensation in the form of payment to the city's tree replacement fund. 
                  (b)  Standards. The following standards have been established for administering these alternatives: 
                  (1)  The OEO must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. 
                  (2)  In no instance shall 100 percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance. 
                  (3)  As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question. 
                  (4)  No permit shall be issued until any required payment has been made to the tree replacement fund. 
                  (5)  The amount per tree density unit to be paid to the tree replacement fund shall be set by resolution of the city council. 
                  (6)  The tree replacement fund shall be used for planting trees on public property or on approved private property, environmental education, management of the tree preservation program, and related purposes.

                  (a)  The cleaning of equipment, storage of materials or dirt, disposal of waste material such as paint, oil solvent or other harmful substances, or any other such act which may be harmful to the continued vitality of the tree(s) within the tree protection area, is prohibited. 
                  (b)  Prior to commencement of any grading, construction or tree removal, a tree protection area for any tree located within 25 feet of any proposed grading, construction or tree removal must be established by physical barrier and maintained until such work is completed.

                  (a)  Every property owner or occupant shall be responsible for the normal care of trees located on such property. Willful injury or disfigurement of any tree growing within the city shall be a violation of this ordinance. No person shall: 
                  (1)  Pour any material on a tree or on nearby ground which could be harmful to the tree; 
                  (2)  Cause or encourage any unnecessary fire or burning near or around any tree; 
                  (3)  Cut off air, light, or water from the roots; 
                  (4)  Pile building material or equipment around any tree so as to cause injury thereto. 
                  (b)  Prior to any tree removal or commencement of construction on a site to be developed, the following system shall be used: 
                  (1)  Location and types of tree protection devices. 
                  a.  Tree protection devices are to be installed as shown on the plan or otherwise completely surrounding the critical root zone of all the trees to be preserved. 
                  b.  The plan shall indicate whether the tree protection device is to be active or passive. 
                  c.  Active protection (see material section below) is required where tree save areas are located in proximity to construction activity. 
                  d.  Passive protection (see material section below) may be used in more remote locations and in all protected zones not designated as tree save areas. 
                  e.  All tree save areas must be protected from soil sedimentation intrusion through the use of silt screens or other acceptable measures placed up-slope from the tree protection area. 
                  f.  The locations and installation of all tree protection devices will be verified prior to the issuance of the construction permit for clearing and/or grading. All tree protection devices must be maintained intact throughout construction. 
                  g.  Once protected zones are established and approved, any changes are subject to review by the city. 
                  (2)  Materials. 
                  a.  Active tree protection shall consist of chain link, orange laminated plastic, wooden post and rail fencing or other equivalent restraining material. In addition to fencing, where tree trunks are in jeopardy of being damaged by equipment, the ordinance enforcement officer shall require two-inch by four-inch boards to be strapped around the trunks of trees. In addition, where active tree protection is required, each tree to be saved shall be marked at the base of the trunk with blue colored water-based paint. 
                  b.  Passive protection shall consist of heavy mil. plastic flagging, a minimum of four inches wide with dark letters on a bright background reading "Tree Protection Area - Do Not Enter" or equivalent signage on a continuous, durable restraint. 
                  (c)  Installation and removal. All tree protection devices shall be installed prior to any clearing, grubbing or grading. The ordinance enforcement officer must inspect the installation of tree protection, erosion and sedimentation control devices prior to the issuance of the tree removal permit. Tree protection must remain in functioning condition until the certificate of occupancy is issued.

                  (1)  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. 
                  (2)  An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 
                  (3)  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
                  (b)  Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the city building inspector finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the planning commission of the city may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
                  (2)  Except as provided above, the Planning Commission of Berkeley Lake shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the planning commission. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
                  a.  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  i.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
                  ii.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship. 
                  b.  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  (3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
                  a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
                  b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
                  d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
                  e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
                  f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
                  g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
                  h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
                  (4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
                  a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
                  c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
                  d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
                  e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and 
                  f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

                  Sec. 62-1. - Findings, purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  The mayor and couuncil find that signs are an important and effective medium through which persons may convey a variety of messages, both commercial and non-commercial in character. The mayor and couuncil further find that the regulation of location, size, placement, height and other relevant physical characteristics of signs and sign structures is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, facilities and properties within the City of Berkeley Lake without difficulty or confusion; to improve the general aesthetic of the city; and to protect the value of properties therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of homes and businesses in the city in the event of police, fire or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies. Left unregulated, signs can become a substantial threat to public safety by way of traffic or pedestrian hazards and a detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. The mayor and couuncil also find that the regulations contained herein directly advance the stated purposes and such regulations are narrowly tailored to serve the city's interests. 
                  (b)  The city's purpose in enacting these regulations is to: 
                  (1)  Balance the right of persons to convey their messages through signs with the right of the public to be protected from the adverse effects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs. 
                  (2)  Enhance the economic health of existing and future businesses and industries within the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs advertising goods and services. 
                  (3)  Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (4)  Provide for signs which are compatible with their surroundings. 
                  (5)  Promote and protect the unique natural beauty and aesthetic qualities of the city 
                  (6)  Reduce the probability of traffic or pedestrian accidents by restricting visual obstructions or distractions caused by signs or lights. 
                  (7)  Create a comprehensive and balanced system of sign control that ensures the fair and consistent enforcement of the regulations and the proper maintenance, structural soundness, safety, appearance and attractiveness of signs and sign structures. 
                  (8)  Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan, which is expressly incorporated herein. 
                  (c)  Promote the state purposes of the city's zoning ordinance, which are expressly incorporated herein.These regulations are intended to ensure the protection of free speech rights guaranteed by the United State[s] Constitution and Georgia Constitution. They are not intended to and do not restrict the content of sign messages. These regulations do not apply to signs located on public property, including rights-of way. The placement, regulation and enforcement of signs on public lands, including rights-of-way, shall be in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations of the State of Georgia, Gwinnett County and the City of Berkeley Lake, as applicable.

                  (Ord. No. O-190-15, § 1, 9-17-2015) 
                  Sec. 70-7. - Utility registration. 
                  (a)  Registration required. Each utility who occupies, uses or has facilities in the rights-of-way at the time of passage of this ordinance, including by lease, sublease or assignment, to operate facilities located in the rights-of-way, unless specifically exempted by state or federal law or this code, shall file a registration statement with the city within 90 days of the effective date of this Ordinance. 
                  (b)  Registration procedure. The registration information provided to the city shall be on a form approved by the city and include, but not be limited to: 
                  (1)  The name, legal status (i.e. partnership, corporation, etc.), street address, email address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the utility filing the Registration Statement (the "registrant"). If the registrant is not the owner of the facility in the right-of-way, the registration shall include the name, street address, email address if applicable, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the owner; 
                  (2)  The name, street address, email address if applicable and telephone and facsimile numbers of one or more facilities representative(s). Current information regarding how to contact the facilities representative(s) in an emergency shall be provided at the time of filing a registration and shall be updated as necessary to assure accurate contact information is available to the city at all times; 
                  (3)  A copy, if requested, of the utility's certificate of authority (or other acceptable evidence of authority to operate) from the Georgia Public Service Commission and/or the FCC and any other similar approvals, permits, or agreements. 
                  (4)  A copy, if requested, of the service agreement, if applicable or other legal instrument that authorizes the utility to use or occupy the right-of-way for the purpose described in the registration. 
                  (c)  Incomplete registration. If a registration is incomplete, the city administrator shall notify the registrant and shall provide a reasonable period of time in which to complete the registration. If a registration is complete, the city administrator shall so notify the utility in writing. 
                  (d)  Acceptance of the registration shall not convey title in the rights-of-way. Acceptance of the registration is only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the city for the limited purposes stated in the acceptance. Acceptance of the registration does not excuse a utility from obtaining permits required by city ordinances nor from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before using the facilities of others, including the city. Acceptance of the registration does not excuse a utility from notifying the city of construction as required herein. 
                  (e)  Facilities in place without registration. Beginning one year after the effective date of this article, any facilities or part of a facility found in a right-of-way for which registration is required but has not been obtained unless specifically exempted by law, and for which no valid service agreement exists with the city, may be deemed to be a nuisance and an unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prosecuting the violator; and/or any other remedy provided by city ordinance or otherwise allowed in law or in equity. 
                  (Ord. No. O-190-15, § 1, 9-17-2015) 
                  Sec. 70-8. - Construction permits. 
                  (a)  Permit required. It shall be unlawful for any utility to excavate or to construct, install, maintain, renew, remove or relocate facilities in, on, along, over or under the public roads of the city without a utility permit from the city in accordance with the terms of this article. 
                  (b)  Permit procedure. Utility permits shall be obtained from the city administrator (or such other person as the city administrator may designate) upon application made on forms prescribed by the city administrator. The written application shall include the following: 
                  (1)  The name and address of the utility; 
                  (2)  The nature, extent, and location of any work proposed to be done, along with satisfactory plans as attachments showing in detail the location of the proposed facility or operations as described in the permit application. The plans shall show the size or capacity of facilities to be installed; their relationship to street features such as right-of-way lines, pavement edge, structures, etc., horizontal and vertical clearance to critical elements of the roadway and any other information necessary to evaluate the impact on the street and its operation; 
                  (3)  The name and address of the person or firm who is to do such work; 
                  (4)  The name, street address, email address if applicable and telephone and facsimile numbers of one or more facilities representative(s); 
                  (5)  The projected dates for the work to be started and finished; 
                  (6)  An indemnity bond or other acceptable security in an amount to be set by the city to pay any damages to any part of the city road system or other city property or to any city employee or member of the public caused by activity or work of the utility performed under authority of the permit issued; 
                  (7)  A copy, if requested, of the registrant's certificate of authority (or other acceptable evidence of authority to operate) from the Georgia Public Service Commission and/or the FCC and any other similar approvals, permits, or agreements; and 
                  (8)  A copy, if requested, of the service agreement, if applicable or other legal instrument that authorizes the utility to use or occupy the right-of-way for the purpose described in the application. 
                  (c)  Permit fees. Fees shall be determined by the city administrator, subject to the approval by resolution of the city council. A fee schedule shall be available at the offices of the city administrator and the city clerk and open for public inspection. 
                  (d)  Issuance of permit. If the city administrator determines the applicant has satisfied the following requirements, the city administrator may issue a permit. 
                  (1)  Whether issuing of the approval will be consistent with this article; and 
                  (2)  Whether applicant has submitted a complete application and has secured all certificates and other authorizations required by law, if applicable, in order to construct facilities in the manner proposed by the applicant; and 
                  (3)  The impact on safety, visual quality of the streets, traffic flow, and other users of the right-of-way and the difficulty and length of time of the project, construction or maintenance. 
                  (e)  Emergency situations. 
                  (1)  Each utility shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the city administrator of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The utility may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. A utility who engages in an emergency excavation shall take all reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize damage to any existing facilities. 
                  (2)  In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding utility facilities, the city may attempt to contact the affected utility or facilities representative. The city may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, including cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or other parts of the facilities. The city shall not incur any liability to the utility, for such emergency actions, and the cost of such shall be paid by each utility affected by the emergency. 
                  (f)  Effective period of permit. 
                  (1)  Each permit shall have a set commencement and expiration date based on information provided in the applicant's permit application. 
                  (2)  The permit shall remain in place until construction is completed or until its expiration date unless the utility is in default. The city administrator may give written notice of default to a utility if it is determined that a utility has: 
                  a.  Violated any provision or requirement of the issuance or acceptance of a permit application or any law of the city, state, or federal government; 
                  b.  Attempted to evade any provision or requirement of this article;

                  d.  Made a material misrepresentation or omission of fact in its permit application. 
                  (g)  Cancellation for cause. If a utility fails to cure a default within 20 working days after such notice is provided to the utility by the city, then such default shall be a material breach and city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity to terminate the permit. If the city administrator decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure shall be followed: 
                  (1)  City shall serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a utility a minimum of 15 calendar days to cure its breach. 
                  (2)  If the utility fails to cure within 15 calendar days, the city may declare the permit terminated. 
                  (h)  Expiration of permit. If work is not begun within six months of the date of issuance, the permit will automatically expire.

                  Sec. 70-9. - Required minimum standards. 
                  (a)  Utility accommodation manual adopted. The 2009 Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards manual, including all references contained therein to codes, rules, regulations, schedules, forms and appendix items, except Appendix B (permit forms and supporting documents), promulgated by the State of Georgia Department of Transportation, as may be amended from time to time is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated in the article as if fully set forth herein, subject to the amendments and modification contained in this article. A copy of the manual shall be maintained at the offices of the city administrator or his designee and open for public inspection. Any conflicts between the provisions of this ordinance and the manual shall be resolved in favor of the manual. References to state personnel, agencies, and fees shall be interpreted, where required, as meaning the City of Berkeley Lake municipal equivalents. 
                  (b)  Protection of traffic and roadway. Unless specifically in the permit, no utility may occupy the city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the city from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way or the right-of-way itself. 
                  (c)  Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time by the city during the term of the permit and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon reasonable notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocated all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation. 
                  (d)  Installation of poles and other wireholding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners. Conduit, poles, wires, cables and related facilities shall be reasonably shared by users, and reasonable shared access shall be negotiated among users. No additional poles or structures may be added in the rights-of-way for the sole purpose of accommodating a utility facility. Existing poles or structures may be replaced as necessary as long as the replacement pole or structure is not more than five feet greater in height. 
                  (e)  As provided in O.C.G.A. § 25-9-6 (the Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act) and other applicable state law currently in place or as amended, no utility shall commence, perform, or engage in blasting or in excavating with mechanized excavating facilities unless and until the utility planning the blasting or excavating has given 48 hours' notice by submitting a locate request to the utility protection center, beginning the next working day after such notice is provided, excluding hours during days other than working days.

                  Sec. 70-10. - Restoration of property. 
                  (a)  Each utility shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the rights-of-way and adjoining property or other facilities which it or its facilities damage. 
                  (b)  A utility shall be liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace, restore or repair, any street, facilities or property or structure thereon, thereunder, thereover or adjacent thereto that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of the construction or installation, operation, upgrade, repair or removal of facilities to a condition as good as or better than its condition before the work performed by the utility that caused such disturbance or damage. If the utility does not commence such replacement or repair after 20 working days following written notice from the city, the city or the owner of the affected structure or property may make such replacement or repair and the utility shall pay the reasonable and actual cost of the same.

                  Sec. 70-11. - Inspection. 
                  (a)  The utility shall make the construction site available to the city administrator and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction. 
                  (b)  At any time, including the time of inspection, the city administrator may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates the terms and conditions of the permit and/or this article or issue an order to correct work which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. 
                  (c)  When the construction under any permit is completed, the utility shall notify the city.

                  Sec. 70-12. - Other approvals, permits and agreements. 
                  (a)  Additional permits required. The utility shall obtain all construction, building or other permits or approvals as according to city ordinance, state or federal law. In addition, a permittee shall comply with all requirements of laws, shall complete work in a way as to not cause any unnecessary or unauthorized obstructions of sidewalks, streets, waterways or railways, and is responsible for all work done in the rights-of-way regardless of who performs the work. No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except in the case of an emergency.

                  (a)  Every utility convicted of a violation of any provision of this article shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 per violation.

In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits.

                  Sec. 70-14. - Other provisions. 
                  (a)  Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this article is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
                  (b)  Reservation of regulatory and police powers. The city by issuing a written approval of registration under this article, does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the city under the Constitution and Laws of the United States, State of Georgia and the City Charter, and under the provisions of the city's codified ordinances to regulate the use of the rights-of-way. The utility by applying for and being issued a written permit, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A utility is deemed to acknowledge that its interests are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. In particular, all utilities shall comply with city zoning and other land use requirements pertaining to the placement and specifications of facilities. 
                  (c)  Compliance. No person shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this article by reason of any failure of city to enforce compliance. 
                  (d)  Appeal of administrative decisions. All appeals provided for by this article and any notification to the city required by this article shall be in writing and sent via certified mail to the city administrator as specified in this article. 
                  (e)  Article headings. Article headings are for convenience only and shall not be used to interpret any portion of this article.

                  Sec. 77-2. - Definitions. 
                  Accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structure. 
                  Alternative tower structure means man-made structures resembling trees, clock towers, bell steeples, light poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures that, in the opinion of the city clerk, are compatible with the natural setting and surrounding structures, and effectively camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers. 
                  Antenna means any exterior transmitting or receiving devices mounted on a tower, building or structure and used in communications that radiate or capture electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio, wireless telecommunications signals or other communications signals. Such definition does not include for purposes of this article, radar antennas, amateur radio antennas, satellite earth stations, MMDS antennas, television receiving antennas and direct broadcast satellite dishes. 
                  Co-location means the placement of antennas of two or more service providers on the same tower or alternative tower structure. 
                  Height when referring to a tower or other structure means distance measured from the finished grade of the parcel to the highest point on the tower or other structure, including the base pad and any antenna. If the base pad or support structure is on a sloped grade, then the average between the highest and lowest grades shall be used in calculating height. 
                  Microcell means a wireless communication facility comprised of antennas extending no more than four feet above the structure to which it is attached, and with an area no larger than 576 square inches (e.g. 3′ × 1½′) panel antenna or a two-foot diameter parabolic antenna as viewed from any one point. 
                  Preexisting towers and preexisting antennas mean any tower or antenna for which a building permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this chapter, including permitted towers or antennas that have not yet been constructed so long as such approval is current and not expired. 
                  Scenic views mean geographic areas in Berkeley Lake which have been included in any nature preserve or scenic preservation efforts; or have sufficient scenic merit as determined by council so as to require preservation. A scenic view may be from a stationary viewpoint or be seen as one travels along a roadway or path. 
                  Tower means any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supported monopole towers, common-carrier towers, and cellular telephone or PCS towers. 
                  Wireless transmission facilities means the buildings, cabinets, equipment and property, including but not limited to, generating and switching stations, repeaters, cables, wires, conduits, ducts, pedestals, antennas, towers, alternative tower structures, electronics and other appurtenances used to transmit, receive, distribute, provide or offer low-power mobile voice transmission, data transmission or other wireless communications by linking a wireless network or radio wave transmitting device through a series of short range, contiguous cells that are part of an evolving cell grid.

                  Sec. 77-3. - Applicability. 
                  All new towers and antennas shall be subject to the regulations contained within this chapter except as provided in subsections (1) through (3), inclusive: 
                  (1)  Public property. Nothing in this article shall be read to prohibit a government owned tower from being located at a specific site when the tower is required to protect the public welfare or safety. 
                  (2)  Amateur radio; receive-only antennas. This chapter shall not govern any amateur radio tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive only antennas. 
                  (3)  Pre-existing towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall not be required to meet the provisions of this chapter, other than the requirements of section 77-10. Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to in this chapter as "preexisting towers" or "preexisting antennas." However, in the event a preexisting tower or antenna ceases to function, then the subject tower, antenna and related equipment shall be removed from the subject property within 90 days at the facility owner's expense.

                  Sec. 77-4. - Permitted uses. 
                  (a)  Upon approval by the planning and zoning commission and receipt of an appropriate building permit, freestanding communication towers may be located in the Light Industrial (M-1) and Neighborhood Business (C-1) zoning districts; provided, however, such towers shall satisfy all of the conditions of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Upon approval by the planning and zoning commission and receipt of an appropriate building permit, rooftop mounted communications towers and antennas may be located on any nonresidential building and alternative tower structure in the city so long as: 
                  (1)  Antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop maintain a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact; 
                  (2)  Such tower or antenna is set back from any existing or proposed off-site residence and separated from any residentially zoned property at least a distance equal to two times the full height of the tower and antenna, but in no event less than 100 feet. 
                  (3)  The existing free-standing nonresidential structure other than a tower on which such tower or antenna will be placed is 50 feet in height or greater and the tower or antenna will add no more than 20 feet total to the height of said existing structure; 
                  (4)  No advertising or writing is permitted on an antenna or tower; 
                  (5)  No signs or illumination are permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the planning and zoning commission may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views; and 
                  (6)  The number and location of antennas, communication towers or other receiving or transmitting devices located on a single structure is not excessive and does not adversely affect properties and views. 
                  (c)  Prohibitions. 
                  (1)  No new tower may be established if there is a technically suitable space available on an existing tower within the search area that the new tower is to serve. 
                  (2)  No new tower shall be allowed in a residentially zoned district (R-100, RA-101). 
                  (3)  No new tower except a camouflaged tower shall be located within 300 feet of a residentially zoned district. 
                  (4)  No new tower shall be allowed in an office-institutional zoned district (O-I). 
                  (Ord. No. O-99-09, 6-18-2009) 
                  Sec. 77-5. - General requirements. 
                  (a)  Application for construction/placement . An application shall be required for the construction or placement of all new wireless transmission facilities and new co-location facilities, antennas or towers within the city limits. Each application shall include plans, specifications and fees as required by this chapter. 
                  (b)  Structural integrity . To ensure the structural integrity of communication towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communication towers at least once every two years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the city clerk. The owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the city may remove such tower at the owner's expense. 
                  (c)  Regulatory compliance. All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the communications towers and antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such communications towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communication tower is in compliance with all federal requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted to the city clerk every 12 months. 
                  (d)  Ownership . Tower owners shall register ownership annually with the city and ownership changes with the city within 30 days of any change. 
                  (e)  Letter of intent for use . The tower owner must file with the city a letter of intent for use every 24 months and provide the city with a copy of any notice to the FCC of intent to cease operations within 60 days of the date planned to cease. 
                  (f)  Security . Communication towers shall be enclosed by visually pleasing, decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, the planning and zoning commission may waive such requirements for alternative tower structures. Chain-linked fencing is not permitted. 
                  (g)  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on any antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the planning and zoning commission may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the lease disturbance. 
                  (h)  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. 
                  (i)  Visual impact. Proposed facilities shall be designed to avoid having an undue aesthetic impact on prominent ridgelines, Greenspace conservation areas, adjacent residential areas and shall not unreasonably interfere with the view from any public park, natural scenic vista, Lake Berkeley, or major view corridor. Height and mass of facilities shall not exceed that which is essential for the intended use and public safety. The planning and zoning commission shall have the authority to impose conditions consistent with the purpose of this section in approving a proposed facility. Furthermore, the planning and zoning commission may designate an alternative location for the tower to be evaluated by the applicant if it is determined that the proposed location would result in undue adverse aesthetic impacts. In consideration of this, the applicant may revise its application to include such a site, assuming it is available to the applicant and reasonably technically feasible to meet the applicant's communication objectives. 
                  (1)  In order to protect public safety and to preserve the scenic character and appearance of the area, the height limit for towers, antennas and tower-related fixtures shall be not more than 20 feet above the average height of the tree line measured within 100 feet of the highest vertical element of the telecommunications facility. Notwithstanding the above, additional height may be approved upon a finding by the planning and zoning commission that the additional height is necessary in order to provide adequate coverage in the City of Berkeley Lake or to accomplish collocation of facilities and that the additional height will not cause an undue visual impact on the scenic character or appearance of the area. 
                  (2)  Towers, antennas and any necessary support structures shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color camouflaging and architectural treatments use of stealth design, including those which imitate natural features, is encouraged and may be required in visually sensitive locations. 
                  (3)  Any tower applicant that is not proposing a camouflaged tower must provide a detailed explanation why they are not proposing a camouflaged tower. Explanation must discuss items other than economics. 
                  (4)  Non-camouflaged towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (5)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  (6)  Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar design and scale. 
                  (7)  Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower. 
                  (j)  Landscaping . Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials, which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. Landscaped strips shall satisfy the minimum design and planting requirements for buffers established in Article VII, "Buffers, Landscape and Tree Regulations". 
                  (2)  All existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the greatest extent practical. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing trees to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  (3)  In lieu of these standards, the planning and zoning commission may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions above. 
                  (k)  Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
                  (1)  Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made. 
                  (2)  Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. The minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be the greater of 100 percent of the breakpoint or 25 feet for a monopole, lattice or guy tower. This separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site. 
                  (3)  Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals. 
                  (l)  Setbacks and separation. 
                  (1)  Towers must be setback from adjoining property lines a minimum distance equal to the tower height, including antennas and other vertical appurtenances. 
                  (2)  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setbacks, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
                  (3)  All guy wires and above-ground accessory facilities associated with the communication tower shall be located to meet the setbacks required by the underlying zoning district where the tower is to be located. 
                  (4)  The planning and zoning commission shall have the authority to reduce or waive any required setback upon the request of the applicant if the tower or support structure will be less visible as a result of the diminished setback. The planning and zoning commission must also find that the reduction or waiver of the setback is consistent with the purposes and intent of this chapter. The structure must still meet the underlying setback requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.

                  Sec. 77-6. - Tower requirements. 
                  (a)  Application: Contents; fee. All applications for permission to construct new telecommunications towers shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission. Each application shall contain as a part thereof detailed plans and specifications as set forth in section 77-5. An application shall not be accepted for processing without the information required in this chapter. An application fee shall be charged by the city in an amount stated in the schedule of fees. 
                  (b)  Exhibits required. Each applicant requesting permission to construct a new telecommunications tower under this chapter shall submit a scaled site plan, scaled elevation view and supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements including topography (utilizing minimum two-foot contour intervals), tower height requirements, setbacks, access driveways or easements, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent land use, and any other information deemed by the city to be necessary to assess compliance with this chapter and compatibility with surrounding uses. 
                  (c)  Co-location of antennas. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates by reasonable and credible evidence that no existing tower or structure is available to accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna as set forth in section 77-8 contained herein. Supporting evidence may consist of any of the following conditions: 
                  (1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements, and modification of existing towers or structures can not be made at a reasonable cost. 
                  (3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment, and modification of existing towers or structures can not be made at a reasonable cost. 
                  (4)  The applicant's proposed system would cause electromagnetic interference with the system on the existing tower or structure, or the system on the existing tower or structure would cause interference with the applicant's proposed system, and the interference can not be eliminated at a reasonable cost. 
                  (5)  The fees, cost or contractual provisions required by the owner to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. 
                  (6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers or structures unsuitable. 
                  (7)  Costs are considered reasonable if they conform to contractual terms standard in the industry and do not exceed the cost of new tower development by more than 25 percent. 
                  (d)  Considerations for reviewing new telecommunication towers. Any denial of a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications facility shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. The planning and zoning commission shall consider the following factors in reviewing applications for new telecommunication towers: 
                  (1)  The height and setbacks of the proposed tower; 
                  (2)  The proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
                  (3)  The nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;

                  Sec. 77-7. - Shared use. 
                  All new towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum number of additional users technically practicable. 
                  (1)  Once a new tower is approved, additional antennas and accompanying accessory uses may be added to it in accordance with the approved share plan if the planning and zoning commission finds that the standards of this chapter are met. 
                  (2)  For a new tower to be approved, the owner shall be required as conditions of approval to do the following: 
                  a.  Record the letter of intent to include a project contact and a brief description of the site where the tower is located at the City of Berkeley Lake in the office of the city clerk; 
                  b.  Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information from a potential shared use applicant; 
                  c.  Negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties; and 
                  d.  Allow shared use where the third party seeking such agrees in writing to pay reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all charges necessary to modify the tower and transmitters to accommodate shared used, but not total tower reconstruction, and to observe whatever technical requirements as necessary to allow shared use without creating interference. 
                  (3)  Willful, knowing failure of an owner whose tower is approved after the effective date of this chapter to comply with the requirements of a. through d. above shall be grounds for withholding approval of any application by such owner for a building permit for any tower or antenna. 
                  (4)  Such conditions shall run with the land and be binding on subsequent purchasers of the tower site.

Said deposit of cash shall be kept current to cover the actual costs of removal. 
                  (3)  A letter of credit from a financial institution in a form approved by the City of Berkeley Lake providing that the financial institution does guarantee funds in an amount equal to the aforementioned cost of removal and that in the event the applicant fails to remove the structure in accordance with the terms set forth above, the financial institution shall pay to the City of Berkeley Lake immediately and without further action, such funds as necessary to finance the removal of the structure up to the amount specified in the letter of credit. Such amount shall be kept current to cover the actual costs of removal. 
                  (c)  If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this chapter as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna.

                  Sec. 78-92. - Adult commercial establishments. 
                  (a)  Findings: public purpose. Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to: Houston, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Dayton, Ohio; Lilburn, Georgia; and Gwinnett County, Georgia; which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City of Berkeley Lake, and based on documentary evidence and oral presentation submitted during the meeting of the mayor and council on November 16, 2006; and based upon the record of the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners' public hearing and regular meeting which was held on August 7, 2001, including the record of testimony by Colonel John Latty, Officer John Jenkins, and Investigator J. P. Droualt of the Gwinnett Police Department, and further comments in that meeting by representatives of the adult entertainment industry, the mayor and council of the city take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country. 
                  (1)  It is the finding of the mayor and council of the city that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
                  (2)  Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment, are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described. The mayor and council of the city find it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will occur in the city, as well. 
                  (3)  Furthermore, it is the finding of the mayor and council of the city that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, and adult theaters, have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities. 
                  (4)  The mayor and council of the city find that the negative secondary effects of adult commercial establishments upon the city are similar whether the adult commercial establishment features live nude dancing or sells or rents video tapes depicting sexual activities. In addition, the county's experience with an adult bookstore located within the county has shown that a substantial amount of activity at the bookstore involves booths which an individual may enter, view videos depicting sexual activity, and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth through a hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths. 
                  (5)  The city, therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's daycare facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult commercial establishments. Therefore, the mayor and council of the city find that it is in the best interest of the city to prohibit adult commercial establishments within the city, particularly in light of the available locations for such businesses within the county. The mayor and council of the city find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further find that such will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression, which rights are expressly acknowledged herein. To that end, this Ordinance is hereby adopted.

                  The commercial districts established in this article are designed to promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare. These general goals include, among others, the following specific purposes: 
                  (1)  To provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations in proximity to residential areas, for local retail development catering to the regular shopping needs of the occupants of nearby residences, with due allowance for the need for a choice of sites. 
                  (2)  To provide appropriate space, and in particular sufficient depth from a street, to satisfy the needs of modern local retail development, including the need for offstreet parking spaces in areas to which a large proportion of shoppers come by automobile, and to encourage the natural tendency of local retail development to concentrate in continuous retail frontage, to the mutual advantage of both consumers and merchants. 
                  (3)  To protect both local retail development and nearby residences against fire, explosion, toxic and noxious matter, radiation and other hazards, and against offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust and other particulate matter, odorous matter, heat, humidity and glare and other objectionable influences. 
                  (4)  To protect both local retail development and nearby residences against congestion, particularly in areas where the established pattern is predominantly residential but includes local retail uses on the lower floors, by regulating the intensity of local retail development, by restricting those types of establishments which generate heavy traffic, and by providing for offstreet parking and loading facilities. 
                  (5)  To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for all types of commercial and miscellaneous service activities, with due allowance for the need for a choice of site. 
                  (6)  To provide freedom of architectural design, in order to encourage the development of more attractive and economic building forms, within proper standards. 
                  (7)  To promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building development in accord with a well-considered plan, to promote stability of commercial development, to strengthen the economic base of the city, to protect the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, to conserve the value of the land and buildings and to protect the city's tax revenue.

                  Sec. 78-299. - Establishment and application. 
                  The Gwinnett County-Annexed (GC-A) zoning district is applied to certain properties that were annexed into the city limits of the City of Berkeley Lake between August, 2011 and the effective date of this zoning ordinance. In addition, at the discretion of the Berkeley Lake mayor and city council, the GC-A district may be applied to properties annexed into the City of Berkeley Lake after the effective date of this zoning ordinance, consistent with the provision of the Zoning Procedures Law (O.C.G.A. §36-66) and this zoning ordinance. 
                  (Ord. No. O-132-11, 10-20-2011) 
                  Sec. 78-300. - Regulation of lands in the GC-A zoning district. 
                  Any properties zoned Gwinnett County-Annexed (GC-A) as shown on the official zoning map, unless otherwise specifically approved by the Berkeley Lake mayor and city council, shall be subject to the property-specific conditions of zoning or special use approval, or both, adopted by the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners by resolution which applied to said properties at the time they were zoned, or the special use was permitted, in unincorporated Gwinnett County immediately prior to annexation. The official Gwinnett County zoning and special use permit files of properties so annexed shall become official files of the City of Berkeley Lake and shall be maintained by the city clerk, and said conditions of zoning or special use approval, or both, adopted by the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners as adopted and applied by the City of Berkeley Lake, shall constitute the zoning regulations governing said properties.

                  Sec. 78-301. - Development of properties in the GC-A zoning district 
                  Properties in the GC-A district shall continue to enjoy the use or uses specifically conferred by formal zoning or special use permit action of the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners immediately prior to annexation. Development of any properties zoned GC-A on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance shall comply with the following: 
                  (1)  The property-specific conditions of zoning adopted by the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners in a property-specific rezoning action by resolution and which were in effect for said property when in unincorporated Gwinnett County immediately prior to annexation. 
                  (2)  The property-specific conditions of special use approval adopted by the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners in a property-specific special use permit action by resolution and which were in effect for said property when in unincorporated Gwinnett County immediately prior to annexation. 
                  (3)  Any modification of zoning or special use permit conditions granted by the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners by official action which are part of the official Gwinnett County files for said property on record with the city clerk. 
                  (4)  Any property-specific variances granted by the Gwinnett County Board of Zoning Appeals and which are a part of the official Gwinnett County files for said property on record with the city clerk. 
                  (5)  Any property-specific modifications of zoning or special use permit conditions approved by the Berkeley Lake mayor and city council through formal action at a regular meeting prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, on record with the city clerk. 
                  (6)  In reviewing a development proposal for compliance with the zoning regulations of the GC-A zoning district, questions may arise as to what other additional dimensional requirements or use regulations apply. In certain cases the city clerk may not be able to resolve such questions by relying on the zoning or special use permit conditions and any applicable variances or modifications of said conditions alone. For example, a building on a site plan approved as a condition of zoning or special use permit approval may not be shown with enough specificity to determine the maximum building height or setbacks that apply to the proposed building. As another example, questions may arise as to whether the use provisions allow for an accessory building, structure, or use on the subject property that is not shown on the site plan approved as a condition. In such instances where questions about development permissions cannot be resolved by applying the above provisions (a) through (e) of this section, the city clerk shall apply regulations of the Berkeley Lake zoning district established in this Zoning Ordinance which most closely resembles the zoning district of Gwinnett County's Zoning Resolution which applied to the property immediately prior to annexation, as more particularly shown below: 

                   
                  (7)  Exceptions. 
                  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Peachtree Corners Overlay District, as established by the Gwinnett County Zoning Resolution, to the contrary, inflatable and temporary signage in conformance with Chapter 62 of this Code shall be allowed.

                  Sec. 78-302. - Remedies for additional development permission. 
                  (a)  In any case where a development is proposed on property zoned GC-A but such development would not be consistent with the provisions of the GC-A zoning district as specified in this chapter, there shall be the following possible remedies: 
                  (1)  File an application to rezone the property from GC-A to another zoning district set forth in the zoning ordinance which will lawfully provide for the proposed development, in accordance with the applicable zoning procedures and section 78-393 of this zoning ordinance. 
                  (2)  File a variance application in accordance with the provisions of Section 78-366 of this zoning ordinance, but only on an individual, case-by-case basis and only involving a single building that cannot meet the yard area, setbacks, buffers, landscape strips, building coverage, lot coverage, or other dimensional (numeric) requirements of the approved site plan and conditions of zoning. No application for a variance shall be filed, accepted, or processed that contains a request to vary dimensional requirements pertaining to more than one principal building; provided, however, that an applicant may file more than one variance application when more than one building is involved. 
                  (3)  The planning commission chair is authorized to grant administrative variances to properties zoned GC-A, pursuant to and as specified in section 78-367 of this zoning ordinance. 
                  (b)  The city clerk shall not accept nor be authorized to process an application to modify the conditions of zoning approval pertaining to properties in the GC-A zoning district. 
                  (c)  The city clerk shall not accept nor be authorized to process an application to modify a site plan or development plan approved by Gwinnett County and made a part of the regulations of the GC-A zoning district; provided, however, that minor revisions to an approved site plan or development plan may be administratively approved by the planning commission chair if in the planning commission chair's judgment such changes: (1) do not involve an increase in density or intensity of the site; and (2) do not alter buffers or setbacks along perimeter boundaries; and (3) do not otherwise result in a change that would be contrary to the public interest or that would be better considered via a public hearing process and a change in zoning or special use approval.

                  Except as this chapter specifically authorizes otherwise, lands annexed into the municipal limits of the City of Berkeley Lake between August, 2011 and the effective date of this zoning ordinance shall be subject to all applicable procedural and substantive requirements of this zoning ordinance as now or hereafter amended.

                  In cases where conditions of Gwinnett County zoning approval applicable to property in the GC-A zoning district require an administrative determination or decision, interpretation, or other administrative action, the city clerk or his designee shall have the authority to make such administrative determination, decision, or interpretation. To this end, the city clerk or his designee shall assume the authority of all administrative officials referred to in said conditions of zoning approval by Gwinnett County; provided, however, that in cases where engineering considerations are specified, the city engineer shall have such administrative authority.

                  (1)  All applications for variances shall be submitted initially, in writing, to the planning and zoning commission of the city, which shall consider these requests at its next called meeting. The planning and zoning commission may authorize such variance from the terms of this zoning chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest. The spirit of this chapter shall be observed, the public safety, health and welfare secured and substantial justice done. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or have authorized representation. Such variances may be granted in individual cases if the planning and zoning commission finds that: 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular property in question because of its size, shape or topography; and 
                  b.  The application of this chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and 
                  c.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
                  d.  Such conditions are not the result of any actions of the property owner; and 
                  e.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public nor impair the purposes or intent of this chapter; and 
                  f.  The variance is granted for a use of land or building or structure that is not prohibited by this chapter. 
                  (2)  All applications for variances shall be made by submitting a completed variance application to city hall. Applicants shall include with their application a written explanation of how the subject property meets all the conditions detailed in subsections (1)a. through f. 
                  (b)  Required notification. Before the planning and zoning commission acts upon an application for a variance: 
                  (1)  The notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published at least 15 days prior to the hearing in the official organ of the county in which the sheriff's advertisements are published. 
                  (2)  The chair of the planning and zoning commission shall ensure that a sign is erected in a conspicuous place on the property involved, which shall contain information as to the variance applied for and the time and place of the hearing. This required sign shall be erected at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Failure to erect and maintain the sign as specified shall invalidate any subsequent determination by the planning and zoning commission, or, upon appeal, by the mayor and council. 
                  (c)  Expiration of approved variances. If applicable portions of this chapter have been amended or modified, or more than one year has elapsed, prior to the commencement of construction or other activity authorized by an approved variance request, a reapplication and hearing before the planning and zoning commission shall be required.

Such variances must meet one of the following conditions and to be granted, the chair of the planning and zoning commission must conclude that the intent of the ordinance can be achieved and equal performance obtained by granting a variance. 
                  (1)  A variance to a numerically qualified ordinance limit where the request does not exceed ten percent of that limit; 
                  (2)  A variance for a conforming change to a nonconforming structure where such change does not increase the impact of the existing nonconformance aspects. 
                  (b)  Required notification. 
                  (1)  A notice shall be published in the official organ of the county in which the sheriff's advertisements are published. 
                  (2)  The chair of the planning and zoning commission shall ensure that a sign is erected in a conspicuous place on the property involved, which shall contain information as to the variance, its administrative approval, and the procedure for appeal. The variance becomes effective on the date the sign is erected and said sign must remain for a period of at least 15 days 
                  (3)  The administrative variance shall be reviewed at, and recorded in the minutes of, the next called meeting of the planning and zoning commission. 
                  (b)  Limitations. An administrative variance may not be granted if any prior variances (granted or denied) were considered for the property involved within the last year. Multiple administrative variances are specifically not permitted.

                  Sec. 78-368. - Buffer fencing exemptions. 
                  (a)  The planning commission may grant exemptions to buffer fencing restrictions when they find those restrictions no longer serve their original purpose. The procedural process defined for variances and appeals shall be followed for public notification and consideration. 
                  (b)  When such exemptions are granted, conditions on construction, materials, fence height, transparency, and other attributes may be set. All other buffer restrictions must continue to be met or the buffer fencing exemption shall be vacated. 
                  (c)  Buffer restrictions formally remain as they appear on the plat and property title. Buffer fencing exemptions apply only to action by the city and do not preclude action by other property owners.

                  Sec. 78-369. - Appeals to the mayor and city council. 
                  (a)  In cases of ordinance enforcement officer or building inspector rulings or planning and zoning commission variances, appeals to the mayor and city council may be made by any person aggrieved or by any official of the city affected by any decision of the ordinance enforcement officer, building inspector, or the planning and zoning commission. Such appeal shall be taken within 15 days by filing with the ordinance enforcement officer, building inspector or the planning and zoning commission, depending from which body's decisions the appeal is made, and with the mayor and city council a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. A copy of the appeal shall be served upon the city clerk. The ordinance enforcement officer, building inspector or the planning and zoning commission shall promptly transmit to the mayor and the city council all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the ordinance enforcement officer, building inspector or the planning and zoning commission certifies to the mayor and city council that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in their opinion, cause immediate peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by the mayor and city council or by restraining order that may be granted by the superior court of the county. 
                  (b)  Before the mayor and city council act upon an appeal by any proper party to review any grant or denial of a variance from the terms of this chapter by the planning commission: 
                  (1)  A public hearing shall be held thereon. A notice of the time and place of the public hearing shall be published at least 15 days prior to the hearing in the official organ of the county in which the sheriff's advertisements are published. 
                  (2)  The applicant for a special exception or appeal from a variance ruling by the planning and zoning commission shall erect in a conspicuous place on the property involved, a sign which shall contain information as to the special exception applied for or the variance ruling being appealed and the time and place of the hearing. This required sign shall be erected at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Failure to erect and maintain the sign as specified above shall invalidate any subsequent determination by the mayor and council.

                  (a)  Meetings of the mayor and city council shall be at the call of the mayor, and at such other times as the members of the mayor and city council may determine. The mayor, or, in his absence, the mayor pro tem, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses by subpoena. The mayor and city council shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member on each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating that fact. 
                  (b)  The mayor and city council shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be filed immediately in the office of the city clerk and shall be a public record. The minutes required hereunder shall be kept separate from the minutes of the regular council meetings.

                  (a)  Any person severally or jointly aggrieved by any decision by the mayor and city council may take an appeal to the superior court of the county. An appeal to the superior court shall be the same as an appeal to the superior court from any decision made by the court of ordinary and as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 15-6-8, except, however, that the appeal may be filed within 30 days from the date of the decision of the mayor and city council.

                  (c)  If the planning commission fails to submit a report to the city council within 60 days of its first meeting after it has received an amendment request complete in all respects, it shall be deemed to have made no recommendation on the proposed amendment. However, the planning commission and the applicant for an amendment may jointly agree to an extension of the 60 days period. 
                  (d)  Before the mayor and city council enact this chapter or an amendment thereto, they shall hold a public hearing thereon.

                  Sec. 78-394. - Standards governing the exercise of zoning power. 
                  The city council finds that the following standards are relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality and general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property and shall govern the exercise of the zoning power: 
                  (1)  Whether a proposed rezoning will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property; 
                  (2)  Whether a proposed rezoning will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property; 
                  (3)  Whether the property to be affected by a proposed rezoning has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned; 
                  (4)  Whether the proposed rezoning will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities or schools; 
                  (5)  Whether the proposed rezoning is in conformity with the policy and intent of any land use plan then in effect; and 
                  (6)  Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which provide supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the proposed rezoning.

                  Sec. 78-395. - Policies and procedures which govern the calling and conducting of hearings. 
                  (a)  The official public hearing shall be called pursuant to the notice provisions of section 78-366. At the official public hearing, the applicant for the amendment shall first be afforded a reasonable opportunity to explain why the rezoning and amendment are being sought. Thereafter, all interested persons shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to speak either for or against the rezoning amendment. The mayor may limit speakers to a reasonable time, which shall in no case be less than ten minutes per side, and may limit irrelevant or repetitious comments and shall maintain the order and dignity of the hearing process. In no event shall the size of the audience, nor the emotions of any of the attendees, be a valid consideration of the city council in acting upon a proposed amendment. Public comments should offer facts relevant to the standards set forth in section 78-367. 
                  (b)  All meetings, both regular and special, at which an amendment to this chapter is to be discussed, considered, or acted upon by the city council shall be open to the public. Notice of special meetings shall be given in accordance with the Georgia Open Meetings Law, O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq. 
                  (c)  Where proper notice is given in accordance with this chapter and in conformity with the Georgia Open Meetings Law, O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq., and, when required, a sign has been posted in accordance with this chapter, no further notice to the property owner or adjacent or nearby property owners shall be required. Failure to provide notice as required by this chapter shall be grounds for the final action on a proposed amendment to be declared null and void. It is the responsibility of the applicant for rezoning to satisfy himself prior to the public hearing that proper notice requirements have been met. Failure to object at the public hearing shall constitute a waiver of claims based upon improper publication of any notice or the posting on the property. 
                  (d)  Copies of the proposed amendment, including the application, supporting documents and plats, and the recommendations of the planning commission shall be maintained by the city clerk and available at the clerk's office for public inspection and copying. Copies of this chapter, including the standards governing the exercise of zoning power and the policies and procedures which govern the conducting and calling of hearings, as from time to time amended, shall be available for inspection at the clerk's office, and copies may be obtained at reasonable charge from the city clerk.

                  (b)  A temporary notation or a temporary map showing the required rezoning change shall be made within two working days and shall be dated and signed by the city clerk.
