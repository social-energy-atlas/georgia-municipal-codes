PREFACE

         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Haralson County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners through November 20, 2007. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Index 
                  The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the a case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time as this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code by the board of commissioners. 
                  (b)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code shall be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: "That section ____________ of The Code of Ordinances of Haralson County, is hereby amended to read as follows: " ____________ ".

                  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition because several court decisions have held that to do so would unlawfully cause to vanish what the courts have declared to be a constitutionally protected form of expression. As to adult erotic dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests, reduced criminal activity, and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  (10)  Any animal that is offensive or dangerous to the public health, safety, or welfare by virtue of the number of animals maintained at a single residence or the inadequacy of the facilities. 
                  Records of appropriate authority means: 
                  (1)  Records of any state, county, or municipal law enforcement agency; 
                  (2)  Records of animal control; 
                  (3)  Records of any county board health;

                  Rescue group means any association or corporation operated as a nonprofit organization and for the purpose of providing care and shelter to animals. Except rescue groups for equine, a rescue group that takes possession of the animals and provides care and shelter must be licensed as an animal shelter or under written contract with a licensed animal shelter, in which case it will be considered an agent for the animal shelter and not an animal shelter itself. An equine rescue group operating for that purpose and maintaining any facility (including, without limitation, providing temporary care at a person's private property) must meet all the requirements of a licensed stable. 
                  Sanitary means a condition of good order and cleanliness to minimize the possibility of disease transmission. 
                  Sanitation means the maintenance of conditions conducive to health and involves bedding changes, as appropriate, cleaning, and disinfection. Cleaning removes excessive amounts of dirt and debris, and disinfection reduces or eliminates unacceptable concentration of microorganisms. To sanitize, therefore, means to make physically clean, and to the maximum degree practical, remove and destroy agents injurious to health. 
                  Severe injury means any physical injury that results in broken bones or disfiguring lacerations requiring multiple sutures or cosmetic surgery, or physical injury that results in death. 
                  Sexually mature animal means any dog or cat that has reached the age of 180 days or six months or more. 
                  Stable means any establishment or other enclosure where equines are maintained for boarding, holding, training, breeding, riding, pulling vehicles, or other similar purposes and a fee is charged for maintaining such equines or for the use of such equines. 
                  Sterilization means the surgical removal of the reproductive organs of a dog or cat in order to render the animal unable to reproduce. 
                  Stray cat means any cat without a collar and proof of rabies vaccination, and that is not claimed by anyone as its owner. 
                  Stray dog means any dog without a collar and proof of rabies vaccination, and that is not claimed by anyone as its owner. 
                  Under control means any animal that is on the property and/or premises of its owner, or is secured by a leash, chain, or lead of sufficient strength to prevent it from escaping from its owner when away from the premises of the owner. An animal may be considered under control if the owner is accompanying the animal and has voice, whistle, or other control over such animal and such animal is trained to respond to such voice, whistle, or other control. The burden of providing that an animal is trained to respond to voice, whistle, or other control remains with the owner of such animal and a rebuttal presumption exists that an animal which is not confined to the premises of its owner without being secured by a chain, leash, or lead of sufficient strength or fence to prevent it from escaping is not under control of its owner. 
                  Unsanitary means and involves conditions such as, but not limited to, filth and bacteria which endanger the health of humans and/or animals. 
                  Veterinary clinic or hospital means a clinic or hospital operated by a licensed veterinarian. 
                  Vicious animal means any animal which constitutes a physical threat to human beings or other animals by virtue of one or more documented unprovoked attacks or threats of attack of such severity as to cause physical injury or significant mental trauma to the victim. An animal is also considered to be vicious if it makes an unprovoked attack on other animals or on physical property. Animal attacks shall be documented by reporting such attacks to the county animal control office. If the animal attack involves the biting of a person or another animal, the attack shall also be reported to the county animal control office. 
                  Wild and exotic animals means any monkey, or other nonhuman primate, as well as raccoon, skunk, wolf, squirrel, fox, leopard, panther, tiger, lion, lynx, ferret, bear, llama, wild rabbit, tarantula, wild rodent, and reptiles, including, but not limited to, crocodiles, alligators, poisonous snakes, caiman, and gavial, and any other animal so designated by the animal control department. The term "wild and exotic animal" does not include domestic dogs (hybrids with wolves, coyotes, or jackals are considered wild animals), domestic cats (hybrids with ocelots or margays are considered wild animals), farm animals, rodents, any hybrid animal that is part wild, and captive bred species of common cage birds, all as defined in O.C.G.A. § 27-5-1 et seq.

                  Sec. 12-1. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Business license tax means a flat rate component of the occupation tax imposed by the county as set forth in this chapter. 
                  Dominant line means the type of business, within a multiple-line business, from which the greatest amount of income is derived. 
                  Investigative fee means a fee charged by the county to defray the costs of inspections, criminal and civil background checks, and fingerprinting, or any of them, required for certain businesses. 
                  Location of office means any structure or vehicle where business, profession, or occupation is conducted, but shall not include a temporary or construction work site which serves a single customer or project or a vehicle used for sales or delivery by a business or practitioner of a profession or occupation which has a location or office. 
                  Occupation tax means the tax imposed pursuant to this chapter on certain businesses, comprised of and representing the total of the business license tax plus the applicable regulatory fee. 
                  Person shall be held to include sole proprietors, corporations, partnerships, nonprofit corporations, or any other form of business organization, but specifically excludes charitable nonprofit organizations that utilize 50 percent of their proceeds for charitable purposes. 
                  Practitioner of profession or occupation is one who by state law requires state licensure regulating such profession or occupation. The term "practitioners of professions or occupations" shall not include a practitioner who is an employee of a business if the business pays an occupation tax. 
                  Regulatory fee means payments, whether designated as license fees, permit fees, or by another name, that are required by the county as an exercise of its police power and as a part of or an aid to regulation of an occupation, profession, or business. The amount of a regulatory fee shall approximate the reasonable cost of the actual regulatory activity performed by the county. A regulatory fee may not include an administrative fee. Development impact fees as defined by O.C.G.A. § 36-71-2(8) or other costs or conditions of zoning or land development are not regulatory fees.

Failure to submit such books or records within said 30-day period shall be grounds for revocation of the tax registration currently existing to do business in the county. Adequate records shall be kept in the county, for examination by the tax assessors office at that officer's discretion. If, after examination of the books and records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of under-reporting, a penalty of $150.00 shall be assessed for the period delinquent. The right of inspection herein shall be limited to those records, which reflect the number of employees of the person business, trade occupation, or profession of the business.

                  Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the authority of the board of county commissioners to regulate the exercise of business in any unincorporated areas of the county and, where authorized by federal, state, or local law or ordinance, to deny persons seeking a business registration or license, or both; nor shall this article in any way limit the authority of conditions for the registration or licensure of businesses, trades, occupations, or professions.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

                  Substantial improvement . 
                  (1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure taking place during a five year period in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The market value of the structure should be: 
                  a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  (2)  The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
                  a.  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 16-61. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 10-7-2008, art. 1, § B) 
                  Sec. 16-62. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  Sec. 16-119. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. The following shall be the standards for new construction and/or substantial improvements: 
                  a.  Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-118(4). 
                  b.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction . New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions in subsection (1) of this section, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth this section and in section 16-87. 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved: 
                  1.  On individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
                  (4)  Recreational vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on sites must: 
                  a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
                  c.  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3) of this section. 
                  (5)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-20 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris, or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

                  (a)  The zoning board as established by board of commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the board chairman in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board may appeal such decision to the county superior court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the zoning board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.

                  Sec. 16-148. - Conditions for variances. 
                  (a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  (1)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  (2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  (3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (b)  The provisions of this article are the minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighted carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (d)  The zoning board secretary shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (e)  Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsections (a) through (e) of this section and the purposes of this article, the zoning board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Sec. 16-180. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, and aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.

                  The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Functions means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quantity and quality and reduction of erosion; habit for wildlife, including rare, threatened, and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic, and recreational amenities. 
                  Generalized wetland map means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county, as indicated on the national wetlands inventory map. 
                  Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soils conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the soil conservation service. 
                  Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in section 16-184(a)(7). 
                  Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. 
                  Wetland protection district means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and shown on the generalized wetland map. 
                  (Ord. of 12-19-2001(8), § 10; Ord. of 12-19-2001(10), § 10) 
                  Sec. 16-182. - Wetland protection district established. 
                  The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service national wetlands inventory maps. This map shall be referred to as the county generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of this generalized wetlands map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or permit from the county. If the area proposed for development is within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the building inspector using the national wetlands inventory map for its area, an U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.

                  The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Hazardous waste has the definition provided in O.C.G.A. § 12-8-62. 
                  Land disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. The term "land disturbing activity" shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
                  Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "the Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species. 
                  Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year. 
                  Port facility means any facility for the docking, loading, and unloading of ships. 
                  Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400-cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. However, those segments of river covered by the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq., or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq. are specifically excluded from the definition of a protected river. In coastal areas, the seaward limit of any protected river shall be the inland limits of the jurisdiction of the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq. 
                  Public utility or utilities means a service provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services. 
                  River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  River corridor means all the land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq., or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq. in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. 
                  (1)  The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river banks, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection district. 
                  (2)  Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the county comprehensive plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs. 
                  Sensitive natural area means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following: 
                  (1)  Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species; 
                  (2)  Rare or exemplary natural communities; 
                  (3)  Significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or 
                  (4)  Other areas so designated by the department of natural resources; and which are sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration. 
                  Single-family dwelling means a dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family.

                  (Ord. of 4-5-2011, § III) 
                  Sec. 16-284. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) above, of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream, that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-5(6), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity; provided, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of, nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 4-5-2011, § IV) 
                  Sec. 16-285. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Haralson County without first obtaining a permit from the Haralson County Zoning and Permits Office to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Haralson County Zoning and Permits Office and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 16-284(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by one copy of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5); provided that, such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 16-284(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 16-284(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 16-284(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met, and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  (a)  The building inspector will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.

                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district, or the commission, or both, shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 2-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (2)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of, nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (3)  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder, or pollute any waters of the state, as defined thereby.

                  (c)  Separation requirement. No telecommunications structure over 180 feet in height shall be located within one-quarter of a mile from any existing telecommunications structure that is over 180 feet in height, except where both structures are located or property zoned for industrial or mining purposes, or where such requirement is determined to be a hardship by the county planning commission and/or commissioner. 
                  (d)  Structural integrity. 
                  (1)  To ensure the structural integrity of the antenna support structure, the owner of a tower shall ensure that the tower withstands a 100 mile-per-hour wind, one-inch ice load, and is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the EIA/telecommunications industries standards for steel antenna towers and antenna supporting structures (or equivalent), as amended. 
                  (2)  If upon inspection, an antenna support structure fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner/operator or the registered agent thereof, the owner/operator shall have 30 days upon receipt of such notice to bring such antenna support structure into compliance with such structural standards. If the owner/operator fails to bring the antenna support structure into compliance within said 30 days, the board of commissioners may deem the facility abandoned, as set forth in section 44-9. 
                  (e)  Design requirements to reduce visual impact. 
                  (1)  Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and zoning district to the extent possible. 
                  (2)  Antenna support structures, buildings, and related structures shall be integrated through location, design, materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping to blend with the existing characteristics of the site to the extent possible. 
                  (3)  Telecommunications antenna support structures shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (4)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than an antenna support structure or an alternative antenna support structure, the antenna, and all associated electrical and mechanical equipment, equipment shelter or cabinet, must be of a neutral color identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting or surrounding structures so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening which may include matching them with existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers, or other background. 
                  (5)  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities shall be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to assist further camouflage. 
                  (6)  Whenever practical, new telecommunications facilities shall be designed, engineered, and constructed to facilitate collocation in surplus space by other telecommunications providers on the same facility. 
                  (7)  Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in any historic district or in any scenic corridors as designated by the board of commissioners or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  (8)  Any equipment shelter or cabinet supporting a telecommunications facility shall be concealed from public view, made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. 
                  (f)  Height restrictions. The maximum heights for all telecommunication structures, regardless of zoning classification of the property on which the structure is located, shall be 250 feet. However, no applicant shall be entitled as a matter of right to erect an antenna support structure that is the maximum allowable height under this chapter; rather, the commissioner, the planning commission, and the building permits department shall consider all relevant factors under the applicable permitting processes, as set forth in this chapter, in determining the maximum allowable height for each proposed antenna support structure. 
                  (g)  Landscaping and buffer requirements. 
                  (1)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the extent feasible; provided, however, that vegetation which caused interference with the antenna or inhibits access to the equipment facility may be trimmed to the extent that access is made available. 
                  (2)  Landscaping shall effectively screen the view of telecommunications facilities from adjacent public rights-of-way, public property and residential property. Additionally, a perimeter buffer having a depth of at least 50 feet shall be required, with a minimum of one tree per 20 lineal feet of buffer, with a minimum of 50 percent being shade-type trees shall be required for all telecommunications facilities. Retention of existing trees on the site in order to meet these requirements is strongly encouraged. Grass and other ground cover species shall be planted on all areas of the buffer strip required which are not covered by other landscape material. 
                  (3)  It shall be the responsibility of the facility owner/operator to keep all buffers and landscaping properly maintained in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was established. 
                  (4)  The planning commission and/or commissioner may waive or modify any of the landscaping requirements where lesser requirements are desirable; for visibility or security purposes; for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms; other remote agricultural or rural locations; for placement of an antenna on an existing structure; or for developed heavy industrial areas. 
                  (h)  Security fencing. All facilities shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices or other similar protective devices to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. By way of example only, a three-stranded barbed wire or rolled razor wire attached to a security fence is an appropriate anti-climbing device. However, the board of commissioners reserves the right to impose stricter measures or waive this requirement, as deemed appropriate. Nothing herein shall prevent fencing which is necessary to meet other requirements of state and federal regulations. 
                  (i)  Lighting. 
                  (1)  No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless: 
                  a.  Required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction;

The board of zoning appeals shall have authority to consider and recommend approval of an application for a variance in cases where strict adherence to height, size, separation, or standards other than setbacks for telecommunications facilities are shown by the applicant to cause special difficulties that include one or more than the following: 
                  (1)  Precludes effective transmission or reception of signals; 
                  (2)  Results in conditions contrary to the purposes of this chapter; or 
                  (3)  Creates unnecessary hardship to the landowner and/or telecommunications providers. Said hardships shall be set forth in detail and presented in writing to the board of zoning appeals. 
                  (b)  Scope of variance. The permissible scope of variances for telecommunications facilities applies to: 
                  (1)  Maximum height, size, or separation requirements; or 
                  (2)  Any other development standard, collocation requirement, or other provisions of this chapter, when considered in conjunction with applicant's specific site request, where the board of zoning appeals finds such provisions inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter or contrary to the requirements of the Telecommunications Act. If requested by the board of zoning appeals, the applicant shall set forth the inconsistent chapter provisions and contrary Telecommunications Act requirements in detail and present the same in writing to the board of zoning appeals. 
                  (c)  Procedure. Requests for a variance and hearings on such requests shall be made in accordance with section 50-261.

In addition to the criteria set forth in section 50-260(b), a variance may be granted by the board of zoning appeals for proposed telecommunication facilities or modifications only upon findings that the proposed telecommunications facility: 
                  (1)  Is the least height and proximity to adjacent properties necessary to provide the coverage by the communications service provider and to achieve the purposes of this chapter; 
                  (2)  Employs all reasonable measures to provide the visual mitigation that screen the facility from views of adjacent residences or undeveloped residential properties; 
                  (3)  Will not produce noise, vibration, odors or illumination which will adversely impact other properties in the vicinity; 
                  (4)  By means of design or location does not present a hazard to adjacent properties; and 
                  (5)  Does not otherwise result in significant adverse impact on the property on which the facility is located, on other property in the vicinity, or on the community in general. 
                  (e)  Approval of variance request to be narrowly construed. Approval of a request for a variance shall be narrowly construed and shall be based on an evaluation of the operational needs of the telecommunications provider, alternative locations, and/or the antenna support structure upon which a proposed antenna might be located, and/or the absence of collocation opportunities as shown by the applicant's good faith efforts respecting existing facilities within one-quarter mile of the proposed site. Evidence shall demonstrate that no practical alternative is reasonably available to the applicant as balanced against any detrimental effect on the surrounding properties. 
                  (Res. of 7-29-2002, § 17.8; Ord. of 12-7-2004, art. XVII, § 17.8)

                  A telecommunications facility may be determined to be abandoned because of discontinued use or falling into disrepair or noncompliance with standards set forth in this chapter.

                  b.  Removal. If after the expiration of the 30-day notice of noncompliance from the board of commissioners no action has been taken by the owner to restore compliance of the facility, the owners/operators of the facility and the property where the facility is located, if not on public property, shall jointly and severally be under a duty to remove the abandoned telecommunications facility. 
                  (3)  Remedies for abandonment. If such facility is not removed within 60 days of receipt of removal notice from the county, the county may remove such facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal, and the county may pursue any and all legal remedies available to it to insure the abandoned telecommunications facility are removed and to recover of all costs associated with the removal. 
                  (4)  No waiver by delay. Delay by the county in taking action shall not in any way waive the county's right to take action. 
                  (5)  Expiration of prior approvals. 
                  a.  Any proposal to reestablish the telecommunications facility after failure to remedy a disrepair or noncompliance shall be treated as a new application, requiring a new conditional use permit and telecommunications facility building permit, subject to reviews, approvals, permits, and fees as required by this chapter. 
                  b.  Any construction, modification, collocation, or other activity requiring a telecommunications provider to obtain either a conditional use permit or telecommunications facility building permit, or both, shall be commenced within six months of obtaining such permits. In the event the permitted activity is not commenced within such time, the permits shall be deemed expired and the applicant shall be required to obtain new permits as required in section 44-5. 
                  (6)  Liability for noncompliance. No time period stated herein shall relieve the owner of a telecommunications facility from responsibility to maintain a safe facility.

Any responsible party or other persons convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction of violating any provision of this chapter shall be subject to penalties as provided in section 1-13. 
                  (b)  If any facility is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained in violation of this chapter or without obtaining that required permits, or if any building, structure or land is used in violation of this chapter, the county, in addition to any other remedies, may institute proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use or to correct or abate such violations.

                  (Res. of 7-29-2002, § 17.12; Ord. of 12-7-2004, art. XVII, § 17.12)

                  The boundaries of each district are as shown on a series of maps, which collectively are entitled "Official Zoning Maps, Haralson County, Georgia," and certified by the zoning administrator. Said maps and all explanatory matter thereon are hereby made a part of and incorporated into the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.

                  (1)  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets or highways, street lines, or highway rights-of-way lines, such centerlines, street lines, or highway rights-of-way lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  (2)  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries. 
                  (3)  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways, or railroads, or rights-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the zoning maps. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on said zoning map. 
                  (4)  Where a district boundary line, as appearing on the zoning maps, divides a lot in single ownership at the time of this enactment, the district requirements for the least restricted portion of such lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided that such extensions shall not include any part of such a lot more than 35 feet beyond the district boundary line.

                  (b)  A residential zoning district that allows a greater dwelling unit density than is normally permitted within a given land use category may be established within such land use category only if the zoning is conditioned so as to limit the allowable density of dwelling units to the maximum permitted by the land use category, according to the table in subsection (a) of this section.

                  Sec. 50-260. - Powers and duties. 
                  (a)  The county zoning administrator shall be authorized to issue administrative variances of no more than ten percent for dimensional requirements of this chapter and subdivision regulations. The administrative variance shall be based on hardship and physical attributes of the property. If, in the opinion of the zoning administrator, a variance is not authorized, the property owner may appeal the decision to the board of appeals. 
                  (b)  The board of appeals shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter or subdivision ordinance. An administrative official is defined as the head of any department subject to these regulations. 
                  (c)  The board of appeals shall authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances from the term of this chapter or the subdivision ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or the subdivision ordinance will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of this chapter or the subdivision ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. (The existence of nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings, or structures in the same district or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance.) Such variances may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board of appeals that all of the following conditions exist: 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography. 
                  (2)  The application of the zoning or subdivision ordinance to the particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship. 
                  (3)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved. 
                  (4)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this chapter.

                  (a)  Appeals to the board of appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved by filing with the zoning department a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. In addition to the notice of appeal, the applicant shall pay an application fee in the amount established by the board of commissioners. The zoning administrator will schedule a hearing by the board of appeals within 30 days of the date the notice on a appeal is filed, unless an emergency situation necessitates a hearing within a period of time not less the 15 days from the date of filing. An appeal from the decision of the board of appeals shall be filed within 30 days from the date of the decision by the board and upon the failure to file the appeal within 30 days of the decision, the decision shall be final. 
                  (b)  No request for a variance may be filed, nor may any variance be granted, which would reduce the minimum setback, yard, area, or other dimensional requirement, the minimum number of parking spaces, or loading berths to less than 25 percent of the minimum required by this chapter. Furthermore, no request for a variance may be filed, nor may a variance be granted, which would increase the maximum height, floor area, ratio, lot coverage, or other dimensional requirement, the maximum number of stories, seats, occupants, clients, students, or other requirement by more than 25 percent above the maximum specified by this chapter. Furthermore, no request for a variance may be filed, nor may a variance be granted for any use of land or structure that is not permitted (or that is prohibited) by this chapter. No appeal may be taken from the planning commission or from the board of commissioners to the board of appeals. 
                  (c)  The procedures as to advertising, notice and impact study as set forth in article X of this chapter shall be followed by the zoning department. 
                  (d)  At the hearing the board shall hear all sworn testimony and any parties is support of or in opposition to the application will be allowed to present sworn testimony.

                  An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board of appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with such administrator, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in such administrator's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice of the zoning administrator, and on due cause shown.

                  b.  Does not affect an area greater than 20 acres in size. 
                  (3)  If a proposed amendment to the official zoning maps exceeds 20 acres in size and would permit a use that is not authorized within the subject property's current land use category as shown on the comprehensive land use map, the applicant must first obtain an appropriate amendment to the comprehensive land use map before applying for the amendment to the official zoning maps. 
                  (c)  The comprehensive land use map may be amended regardless of the zoning districts that apply to the subject property.

                  Sec. 50-294. - Public notification. 
                  (a)  Legal notice. The planning commission shall consider each zoning amendment application and shall reach a decision only after holding a public hearing at which interested parties may express their views on the proposal. Due notice of the first such public hearing before each appropriate examining body, whether the planning commission or, in the case of subsequent appeals, the board of zoning appeals or the board of commissioners, shall be published once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the county. Said notice shall advertise the name of the applicant, the date, time, place, and purpose of the public hearing. It shall appear at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the first public hearing scheduled to be conducted. At least one such notice shall appear in the newspaper in which the legal advertisements of county are carried. If the application is to amend the comprehensive land use map, the notice shall include the location, current land use category, and proposed land use category. However, if the application is for amendment of the official zoning maps, which includes both changes in zone and subdivision of existing tracts, then the notice shall also include the location of the property, the current zoning, and the proposed zoning of the property. The cost of the advertisement shall be borne by the applicant. 
                  (b)  Signs posted. At least 15 days prior to the planning commission's first public hearing, the applicant shall post a sign showing that an application for a zoning amendment has been made, the name of the applicant, the purpose of the application, and the date, time, and address of the public hearing. One such sign shall be posted along each 1,000 feet of public right-of-way or part thereof; each sign shall be located in a conspicuous place at the edge of and facing every public right-of-way fronting the subject property. Upon receipt of the properly completed amendment application and all required submissions, the zoning administrator shall provide the applicant the appropriate signs and shall schedule a public hearing for not less than 45 days later. The applicant shall continuously maintain each such sign until a final disposition of the application has been determined. 
                  (c)  Letters to property owners. The applicant for said zoning amendment shall also give actual notice of said request for zoning amendment and of the public hearing thereon to all property owners within 1,000 feet the of property for which said zoning amendment (other than a text amendment) is requested. Said notice shall be given to all those property owners within 1,000 feet, including those whose property lies outside the boundaries of the county, either in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of said property owner. Said actual notice must be given no later than 15 days prior to the date of said scheduled public hearing. If notice is given by certified mail, said notice must be mailed no later than 18 business days prior to the date of said scheduled public hearing and shall be deemed received three business days after the postmark of the notice. Proof of said notice shall be provided to the body hearing the appeal, the planning commission, the board of zoning appeals, or the board of commissioners. If actual notice of said hearing is given in person, then the applicant shall furnish to the zoning administrator, prior to the scheduled hearing, an acknowledgment of the notice, signed and dated by the person receiving notice and witnessed by an individual other than the applicant. In determining adjoining property owners, road, street or railroad rights-of-way shall be disregarded. (Reliance on the tax assessor's records may not provide the applicant with the most recent owners of record.) 
                  (d)  Instances of nonapplicability. The provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply if the application is initiated by the zoning department staff, the planning commission, or the board of commissioners. 
                  (e)  Equal application. All the public notice requirements of subsection (c) of this section shall apply equally to the hearings of appeals resulting from any decision of the planning commission.

                  Sec. 50-295. - Planning commission action. 
                  (a)  Commission established. There is hereby established the planning commission of the county which shall consist of five members appointed by the board of commissioners for staggered terms of four years. Members shall serve without pay, but may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred while representing the commission. None of the members shall hold any other public office or position in the county, except that one member may also be a member of the county board of zoning appeals (variance board). Appointments shall be made by resolution of the board of commissioners. Any vacancy in the membership of the planning commission shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the initial appointment. Members shall be removable for cause by the board of commissioners upon written charges and after a public hearing; provided, however, that any member who fails to attend three consecutive meetings, without cause, may be removed without a public hearing. The commission may adopt such bylaws as it deems necessary to provide for the orderly conduct of its business. The planning commission previously appointed by the board of commissioners shall continue to serve without change as if appointed under this chapter. 
                  (b)  Hearing of appeals. Pursuant to this article and in accordance with a meeting schedule it has adopted, the planning commission shall consider each zoning amendment application and shall reach a decision only after holding a public hearing at which interested parties may express their views on the proposal. The planning commission shall vote to approve, to deny, or to defer decision on each proposed zoning amendment at the public hearing scheduled to consider each proposal. As a condition of approval, the planning commission may require the applicant to modify his proposal by increasing or decreasing the land area for which the application is being made, by changing the zoning district requested, by requiring the applicant's improvement of existing public infrastructure, and/or by other conditions of rezoning which may be deemed advisable so that the purpose of this chapter will, if applicable, be served, and health, public safety, and general welfare secured. Proposed zoning decisions shall be called in the order determined by the zoning administrator. A written report of the planning commission's decision shall be submitted to the zoning administrator, or his designee, for forwarding to the county board of commissioners for adoption and notice shall be provided to the applicant. The decision and copies of notices shall be kept as a public record. 
                  (c)  Conduct of hearing. 
                  (1)  All persons who wish to address the planning commission at a hearing on the proposed amendment under consideration by the planning commission shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the county prior to the commencement of the hearing. The recording secretary will read the proposed amendments under consideration in the order determined by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator or his designee shall then present the amendment, along with the pertinent departmental reviews, if any, prior to receiving public input on the proposed amendment. The recording secretary will then call each person who has signed up to speak on the amendment in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except the applicant who will always speak first. Prior to speaking, each speaker will identify himself and state his current address. Only those persons who have signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless a majority of the commission, in its discretion, allows the person to speak to the amendment, notwithstanding the failure of that person to sign up prior to the hearing. 
                  (2)  Each speaker shall be allowed five minutes during which to address the planning commission concerning the amendment then under consideration, unless the planning commission, by two-thirds vote of the members present, prior to or during the public hearing, vote to allow additional time in which to address the commission on said proposed amendment. The speaker may initially use all of the speaking time allotted to him or he may speak and reserve a portion of his allotted time for rebuttal. Provided, however, that the proponents and opponents of each amendment shall have no less than ten minutes per side for presentation of data, evidence, and opinion thereon. One member of the planning commission shall be designated as the timekeeper to record the time expended by each speaker. 
                  (3)  Each speaker shall speak only to the merits or deficiencies of the proposed amendment under consideration and shall address his remarks only to the chairperson of the planning commission. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or the discussion of facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed amendment under consideration. The chairperson may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection. 
                  (4)  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the chairperson from conducting the hearing in an orderly and decorous manner to assure that the public hearing on a proposed amendment is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.

At the public hearing, the board of commissioners shall review the analysis submitted by the initiating party, and the recommendation prepared by the planning commission. So that the purpose of this article will be served, and health, public safety and general welfare be secured, the board of commissioners may approve or deny the application, and/or may require the applicant, as a condition of approval, to modify his proposal by increasing or decreasing the land area for which the application is being made, by changing the zoning district requested, by requiring the applicant's improvement of existing public infrastructure, and/or by other conditions of rezoning which may be deemed advisable. Furthermore, the board of commissioners may allow an application to be withdrawn; provided, however, that an application for the same amendment may not be resubmitted for a period of six months from the date of withdrawal. An action by the board of commissioners to defer the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application will be considered, which statement shall constitute public notice of the hearing on the application and no further notice, such as that required by section 50-294 is required. 
                  (b)  Conduct of the hearing. 
                  (1)  All persons who wish to address the commissioners at a hearing concerning a proposed zoning decision under consideration by the commissioners shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the county prior to the commencement of the hearing. 
                  (2)  The zoning administrator or his designee will read the proposed zoning decision under consideration and summarize the departmental reviews pertaining thereto prior to receiving public input on said proposed zoning decision. Proposed zoning decisions shall be called in the order determined by the zoning administrator. 
                  (3)  The zoning administrator or his designee shall then call each person who has signed up to speak on the zoning decision in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except the applicant who will always speak first. Prior to speaking, the speaker will identify himself and state his current address. Only those person who signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless the commissioners, in his discretion, allows the person to speak to the zoning decision, notwithstanding the failure of the person to sign up prior to the hearing. 
                  (4)  Each speaker shall be allowed five minutes to address the board of commissioners concerning the zoning decision then under consideration, unless the commissioner, prior to or during the public hearing, allows additional time in which to address the commissioners on said proposed zoning decision. The speaker may initially use all of the time allotted to him to speak or he may speak and reserve a portion of his allotted time for rebuttal; provided, however, that the proponents and opponents of each amendment shall have no less than ten minutes per side for presentation of data, evidence, and opinion thereon. A member of the commissioner's staff shall be designated as the timekeeper to record the time expended by each speaker.
