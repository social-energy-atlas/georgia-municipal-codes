PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of LaFayette of a general and permanent nature. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, as supplemented through August 1975, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
                  Numbering System 
                  The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the third section of Chapter 4 is 4-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-1 and 4-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-1.1, 4-1.2 and 4-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
                  Indices 
                  The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Mr. David Aldrich, City Manager, Ms. Glenna Thomas, City Clerk, and Mr. Ron Womack, Assistant City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. 
                  MUNICIPAL CODE CORPORATION  Tallahassee, Florida 
                  ORDINANCE NO. 5-88

                  Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before February 9, 1987, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein are repealed. 
                  Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance which is repealed by this ordinance.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided shall apply to the amendment of any Code section whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the mayor and council may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief, and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Any and all additions and amendments to the Code, when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the mayor and council to make the same a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code shall be understood and intended to include the additions and amendments. 
                  Section 6. Ordinances adopted after February 9, 1987, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code, shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
                  Section 7. This ordinance shall become effective immediately upon adoption. 
                  Passed and adopted at the regular June meeting of the Mayor and Council of the City of LaFayette held on June 13, 1988, at City Hall, LaFayette, Georgia. 

                  ATTEST: 

                  Certificate of Adoption 
                  I hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of the ordinance passed at the regular meeting of the Mayor and Council of the City of LaFayette held on the 13th day of June, 1988, and same is still in force and effect and has not been repealed by action of the Mayor and Council. 


                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the code's historical evolution.

However, if the work described in any building permit has not begun within six (6) months from the date of permit issuance, or once construction has begun, if it is discontinued for a period in excess of six (6) months, such permit shall expire and be cancelled by the building official. 
                  (11)  Authority to rescind designation. The mayor and council has the authority to rescind the designation following receipt of a recommendation from the historic preservation commission and receipt of comments at a public hearing noticed in accordance with the provisions for designation. 
                  (Ord. No. 06/09, § 4, 12-14-2006; Ord. No. 09/04, § 2, 6-8-2009) 
                  Sec. 2-105. - Design guidelines for historic districts and landmarks. 
                  (a)  Identification of design guidelines. Concurrent with, or immediately following, the designation of any historic district or landmark, the historic preservation commission shall recommend to the mayor and council a set of "design guidelines" appropriate to the district or landmark. The guidelines are intended to identify the characteristic features of the designation that will be used in determining the compatibility of new construction or alterations of size, location, materials, style, rhythm, and any other quality deemed by the historic preservation commission to contribute to the character of the historic property. 
                  (b)  Procedure for adoption of design guidelines. The historic preservation commission must draft and recommend the proposed design guidelines to the mayor and council at a public hearing. Adoption of the guidelines by mayor and council may only be considered after the historic preservation commission's recommendation and following a public hearing as follows: The historic preservation commission and the mayor and council shall hold a public hearing on the adoption of the design guidelines. Notice of the hearing shall be published in at least three (3) consecutive issues in the legal organ and/or in a newspaper of general circulation within the county. All such notices shall be published not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20) days prior to the date set forth the public hearing. 
                  (c)  Concurrent action. The historic preservation commission may recommend, and the mayor and council may consider and adopt, the design guidelines at the same public hearing and/or meeting as the designation of the corresponding historic district or landmark. The legal notices for the guidelines and designated area may be combined into one (1) notice if the hearings are to be combined. 
                  (Ord. No. 06/09, § 5, 12-14-2006) 
                  Sec. 2-106. - Application to the historic preservation commission for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (a)  Approval of alterations to historic properties. After designation by ordinance of a historic property and adoption of corresponding design guidelines, no demolition or material change in the appearance of such historic property shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof unless or until application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the historic preservation commission. 
                  (b)  Approval of new construction to historic properties. The historic preservation commission shall review and may approve, or approve with conditions pursuant to the provisions of subsection (j) below, concerning undue hardships, and issue certificates of appropriateness to new structures, buildings, objects, or works of art to be constructed within historic property. Such structures, buildings, objects, or works of art shall conform in design, scale, building materials, setback, and landscaping to the character of historic property specified in the historic preservation commission's design guidelines. If, in the opinion of the historic preservation commission, any such structure, building, object or work of art would fail to comply with the guidelines and would be inconsistent with the character of the historic property, the certificate of appropriateness shall be denied. Reasons for denial shall be stated and transmitted to the applicant in writing. 
                  (c)  Submission of plans to historic preservation commission. An application for certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by such drawings, photographs, or plans as may be required by the historic preservation commission. 
                  (d)  Acceptable historic preservation commission reaction to application for certificate of appropriateness: 
                  (1)  The historic preservation commission shall approve or approve with conditions the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change(s) in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property. In making this determination, the historic preservation commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture, and materials of the architectural feature involved, and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style, and pertinent features of the other structures, buildings, objects, or works of art in the immediate neighborhood in accordance with the adopted design guidelines. 
                  (2)  The historic preservation commission shall deny a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change(s) in appearance would have substantial adverse effects on the aesthetic, historic, architectural significance and value of the historic property. 
                  (e)  Public hearing on applications for certificates of appropriateness, notices, and right to be heard. At least seven (7) days prior to review of a certificate of appropriateness the historic preservation commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected by reason of the application and shall give applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. Notice in Walker County's legal organ or newspaper of general circulation within the county shall, for the purpose of this section, be deemed to be sufficient action. 
                  In cases where the historic preservation commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application, notice in Walker County's legal organ or newspaper of general circulation within the county at least one (1) time not less than ten (10) days nor more than twenty (20) days prior to the hearing. At such hearing, any interested party shall be given the opportunity to comment on the request. 
                  (f)  Interior alterations. In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the historic preservation commission shall not consider interior arrangement or use having no effect on exterior architectural features nor shall the commission consider the construction of or alterations to backyard fences. 
                  (g)  Technical advice. When dealing with difficult technical questions, the historic preservation commission shall have the power to seek expert advice within approved budgetary limitations. 
                  (h)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. The historic preservation commission shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for a certificate of appropriateness within no more than forty-five (45) days after the filing of a complete application by the owner or authorized agent of a historic property. Failure of the historic preservation commission to act within such forty-five (45) days shall constitute approval and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (i)  Necessary actions to be taken by historic preservation commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness: 
                  (1)  In the event the historic preservation commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The historic preservation commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure, building, object or work of art which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the historic preservation commission shall be binding upon the building official or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (j)  Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the historic preservation commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to such provisions, or to interpret the meaning of such provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications, or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of such provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the historic preservation commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgement, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. 
                  (k)  Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. Work not in accordance with an issued certificate of appropriateness shall be halted by the building official before it is completed. Any such work shall be considered a violation of this chapter subject to any and all appropriate fines and penalties. 
                  (l)  Certificate of appropriateness void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six (6) months of date of issuance. Certificates of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of eighteen (18) months and are renewable. 
                  (m)  Recording of applications for certificates of appropriateness. The historic preservation commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness and of all the historic preservation commission's proceedings in connection with such application. 
                  (n)  Acquisition of property. The historic preservation commission may, when and only when such action is authorized by the mayor and council, and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise, of the property or any interest therein. 
                  (o)  Appeals. 
                  (1)  Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the historic preservation commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the mayor and council within thirty (30) days of the date of the decision; 
                  (2)  The appeal shall be in writing, shall be filed in the office of the city manager of city, and shall state the name and address of the person filing the appeal, the identification number of the certificate of appropriateness that is being appealed, state facts upon which standing to file the appeal is based, and the grounds for which the determination of the historic preservation commission should be denied by the mayor and council, based on abuse of discretion by the historic preservation commission; 
                  (3)  The appeal hearing before the mayor and council shall be scheduled by the mayor within sixty (60) days of the filing date of the appeal; 
                  (4)  At least ten (10) days but no more than twenty (20) days prior to the date of the hearing, notice of the hearing stating the location of the property by street address, the time, date, place and purpose of hearing shall be posted on the property; published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, and mailed to the person who filed the appeal. 
                  (5)  At least one (1) week prior to the hearing, the mayor and council shall receive from the director of planning a complete record of the historic preservation commission's action, including all information presented by the applicant, proponents and opponents, the planning staff, minutes of the hearing before the historic preservation commission, and all other evidence and documents considered by the historic preservation commission in reaching their determination. If the person filing the appeal wants the mayor and council to have a complete transcript of the hearing before the historic preservation commission, then upon a written request for a written transcript filed with the planning department at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the hearing, the planning department will have a written transcript of the hearing prepared by a certified court reporter and forwarded to the mayor and council prior to the hearing. The applicant must pay the full costs of the transcript to the planning department at least five (5) working days prior to the date of the hearing; 
                  (6)  The procedures for the conduct of the hearing before the mayor and council are as follows: 
                  a.  The party who filed the appeal first presents a ten-minute argument in the support of the appeal, and opponents shall then present their ten-minute argument in opposition to the appeal.

                  c.  Either side may allocate its ten-minute argument period among any number of speakers, provided that the presentation by all speakers for each side shall not exceed ten (10) minutes per side. 
                  d.  All persons wishing to speak during one side's ten-minute argument period must register their intent to do so and the amount of time to be allocated per speaker with the clerk of commission not later than the time that the meeting of the mayor and council at which the hearing on the appeal is to be conducted is first called to order. 
                  e.  In the event that all persons wishing to speak as a part of one side's ten-minute argument are not able to agree how that side's ten-minute argument period shall be allocated, they shall inform the mayor of their disagreement before either side begins its ten-minute argument, in which event the mayor shall decide and announce the manner in which that side's ten-minute argument period shall be allocated. Any commissioner dissatisfied with the mayor's allocation of that side's ten-minute argument shall have the right to appeal the mayor's allocation decision to the commission before either side begins its ten-minute argument. 
                  f.  After the opponents of the appeal have concluded their ten-minute arguments, the party who filed the appeal shall have a three-minute rebuttal. 
                  (7)  The hearing before the mayor and council shall be confined to a review of the record of the historic preservation commission's determination for error based on abuse of discretion of the historic preservation commission. 
                  (8)  The mayor and council may approve, modify and approve, or reject the determination made by the historic preservation commission if the mayor and council finds that the historic preservation commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. 
                  (9)  Appeals from decisions of the mayor and council made pursuant to this chapter may be taken to the Superior Court of Walker County in the manner provided by law for appeals from conviction for city ordinance violations.

                  (e)  Demolition or relocation criteria. The historic preservation commission's decision concerning the certificate of appropriateness for demolition or relocation of a historic site, landmark, or building shall be based on the following criteria: 
                  (1)  The structure is of such interest or quality it would reasonably meet national, state, or local criteria for designation as a historic property. 
                  (2)  The structure, building, object or work of art is of such unusual or uncommon design, texture or materials that it could not be reproduced or be reproduced only with great difficulty and expense. 
                  (3)  Retention of the structure, building, object or work of art would aid substantially in preserving and protecting a structure, building, object, work of art, or district which meets subsections (1) or (2) hereinabove.

The term "city official" also includes all individuals, including city employees, appointed by the mayor and/or city council as appropriate to city authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the mayor and/or city council.

                  Sec. 4-120. - Regulations as to employees and managers. 
                  The following regulations shall apply to all establishments holding a license for consumption of malt beverages and/or wine on the premises: 
                  (1)  No person shall be employed to dispense malt beverages or wine or serve in any managerial position by an establishment holding a license under this division until such person has been fingerprinted and cleared by the director of public safety for the city or his designee and/or city code enforcement officer indicating that the person is eligible for such employment as per the minimum requirements for an applicant under this division. 
                  (2)  This section shall not be construed to include employees whose duties are limited solely to those of busboy(s), cooks, or dishwashers. 
                  (3)  No permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the city clerk or designee and upon payment of a fee in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) and a search of the criminal record of the applicant completed. The application shall include, but shall be limited to, the name, date of birth and prior arrest record of the person, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of the arrest information, the application shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order. 
                  (4)  The city clerk or a designee shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any criminal record of the person fingerprinted. If the person is eligible for employment, the city clerk or a designee shall issue a permit to the person, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the director of public safety or city code enforcement officer or other designee shall notify the person, in writing, that he or she is not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and his or her right of appeal. 
                  (5)  No person shall be granted a pouring permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the city clerk or a designee that such person has not been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to a minor in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexually related crime within a period of five (5) years preceding the date of the application and is not on probation or parole. A person's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a city or county ordinance shall not, by itself, make a person ineligible for an alcohol pouring permit. No person shall be granted a pouring permit who has been convicted, plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state, or local law for any felony within five (5) years preceding the date of the application and is currently on probation or parole. For purposes of this division, a conviction or pleas of guilt or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which a person whose sentence was entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, as amended. Except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored if the person violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the person had previously been sentenced as a first offender. 
                  (6)  An alcohol pouring permit shall be issued for a period of three (3) calendar years from the date of the application. As provided in subsection (11) of this section, the alcohol pouring permit must be in the possession of the employee while the employee is working at the licensed establishment and available for inspection by members of the city police department. After application of the pouring permit is completed with the city, the employee may immediately commence work on a temporary basis provided the employee retains the receipt for the permit on his or her person at all times at the premises for which the alcohol license has been issued, and thereafter, if a permit is issued, must maintain on his or her person at the premises the actual pouring permit. If a permit is not issued, the employee must immediately cease work upon being notified that a permit will not be issued to the employee. 
                  (7)  No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed or covered up any material fact by any device, trick or scheme while making application to the city clerk for an alcohol beverage pouring permit under this section. If it is determined that a person is in violation of this subsection and a permit is denied for this reason, then ninety (90) calendar days must elapse from the date of notification of the denial of the permit before the person may submit a new application for a permit. 
                  (8)  All permits issued through administrative error can be immediately terminated and seized by the city clerk or designee. 
                  (9)  Replacement permits will be issued within thirty (30) days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fee charged for alcohol pouring permits. After thirty (30) days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted. 
                  (10)  All permits issued under this division remain the property of the city and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any city police officer, city code enforcement officer, city clerk or a designee. 
                  (11)  No licensee shall allow any employee or manager required to hold a permit to work on premises unless the employee or manager has in his or her possession a current valid city pouring permit. For new employees, a receipt issued by the city clerk may be used for a maximum of ninety (90) days from the date of its issue unless notified that a permit will not be issued. Licensees are required by this division to inspect and verify that each employee required to do so has in his or her possession a valid current alcohol pouring permit. 
                  (12)  It shall be the duty of all persons holding any license issued under this division to file with the city clerk the name of the establishment, the license number and a list of all employees, with their home addresses and home telephone numbers, twice annually during the month of June and again during the month of December. 
                  (13)  The permit issued under this section shall be issued to individuals only and as long as the permit is valid, may be used at any employer licensed by this division until said license is revoked, suspended, terminated, or expires.

                  Sec. 4-121. - Open area and patio sales. 
                  (a)  Alcoholic beverage sales can be made by a licensed consumption on premises establishment in a patio/open area type environment if the establishment has been approved to do so by the code enforcement officer and is in compliance with any and all other regulations of the city. Also, all sales of malt beverages and wine under this provision must be in opaque containers and not in bottles or cans. 
                  (b)  The requirement for approval is that the patio/open area be enclosed by some structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink without the licensee's knowledge. 
                  (c)  The height of such structure shall be a minimum of three and one-half (3½) feet above the patio floor, but the structure does have to shield or restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area. The structure must be permitted and approved by the code enforcement officer and meet all building and fire code regulations. 
                  (d)  The only exit from the patio/open sales area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises and through an approved fire exit, not for general public use unless an emergency exists. The fire exit must be of a type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists.

                  (d)  It is prohibited for any person to bring his or her own distilled spirits in any establishment, i.e. brown-bagging, regardless of whether such establishment is licensed or unlicensed to serve distilled spirits by the drink.

                  (Ord. No. 18-10, § 3, 12-10-2018) 
                  Sec. 4-161. - Regulations as to employees and managers. 
                  (a)  No person shall be employed to dispense distilled spirits or serve in any managerial position by an establishment holding a license under this division until such person has been fingerprinted and cleared by the chief of police for the city or his designee or city code enforcement officer indicating that the person is eligible for such employment as per the minimum requirements for an applicant under this division. 
                  (b)  No permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the city clerk or designee and upon payment of a fee in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) and a search of the criminal record of the applicant completed. The application shall include, but shall be limited to, the name, date of birth and prior arrest record of the person, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of the arrest information, the application shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order. 
                  (c)  The city clerk or a designee shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any criminal record of the person fingerprinted. If the person is eligible for employment, the city clerk or a designee shall issue a permit to the person, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the chief of police or city code enforcement officer or other designee shall notify the person, in writing, that he or she is not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and his or her right of appeal. 
                  (d)  No person shall be granted a pouring permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the city clerk or a designee that such person has not been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to a minor in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexually related crime within a period of five (5) years preceding the date of the application and is not on probation or parole. A person's first-time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a city or county ordinance shall not, by itself, make a person ineligible for an alcohol pouring permit. No person shall be granted a pouring permit who has been convicted, plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state, or local law for any felony within five (5) years preceding the date of the application and is currently on probation or parole. For purposes of this division, a conviction or pleas of guilt or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which a person whose sentence was entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, as amended. Except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored if the person violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the person had previously been sentenced as a first offender. 
                  (e)  An alcohol pouring permit shall be issued for a period of three (3) calendar years from the date of the application. As provided in subsection (j) of this section, the alcohol pouring permit must be in the possession of the employee while the employee is working at the licensed establishment and available for inspection by members of the city police department. After application of the pouring permit is completed with the city, the employee may immediately commence work on a temporary basis provided the employee retains the receipt for the permit on his or her person at all times at the premises for which the alcohol license has been issued, and thereafter, if a permit is issued, must maintain on his or her person at the premises the actual pouring permit. If a permit is not issued, the employee must immediately cease work upon being notified that a permit will not be issued to the employee. 
                  (f)  No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed or covered up any material fact by any device, trick or scheme while making application to the city clerk for an alcohol beverage pouring permit under this section. If it is determined that a person is in violation of this subsection and a permit is denied for this reason, then ninety (90) calendar days must elapse from the date of notification of the denial of the permit before the person may submit a new application for a permit. 
                  (g)  All permits issued through administrative error can be immediately terminated and seized by the city clerk or designee. 
                  (h)  Replacement permits will be issued within thirty (30) days of original date, upon paying one-half (½) of the fee charged for alcohol pouring permits. After thirty (30) days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted. 
                  (i)  All permits issued under this division remain the property of the city and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any city police officer, city code enforcement officer, city clerk or a designee. 
                  (j)  No licensee shall allow any employee or manager required to hold a permit to work on premises unless the employee or manager has in his or her possession a current valid city pouring permit. For new employees, a receipt issued by the city clerk may be used for a maximum of ninety (90) days from the date of its issue unless notified that a permit will not be issued. Licensees are required by this division to inspect and verify that each employee required to do so has in his or her possession a valid current alcohol pouring permit. 
                  (k)  It shall be the duty of all persons holding any license issued under this division to file with the city clerk the name of the establishment, the license number and a list of all employees, with their home addresses and home telephone numbers, twice annually during the month of June and again during the month of December. 
                  (l)  The permit issued under this section shall be issued to individuals only and as long as the permit is valid, may be used at any employer licensed by this division until said license is revoked, suspended, terminated, or expires.

                  (a)  Alcoholic beverage sales can be made by a licensed consumption on premises establishment in a patio/open area type environment if the establishment has been approved to do so by the code enforcement officer and is in compliance with any and all other regulations of the city. Also, all sales of distilled spirits under this provision must be in opaque containers and not in bottles or cans. 
                  (b)  The requirement for approval is that the patio/open area be enclosed by some structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink without the licensee's knowledge. 
                  (c)  The height of such structure shall be a minimum of three and one-half (3½) feet above the patio floor, but the structure does have to shield or restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area. The structure must be permitted and approved by the code enforcement officer and meet all building and fire code regulations. 
                  (d)  The only exit from the patio/open sales area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises and through an approved fire exit, not for general public use unless an emergency exists. The fire exit must be of a type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists.

                  In addition to the requirements set forth in article II of chapter 5, the following safeguard actions shall be taken by the owner of a vicious animal in recognition of the concern for the safety of the residents of the city: 
                  (1)  An owner or keeper of a vicious animal must keep the animal inside his or her residence at all times unless the animal is directly placed and kept within a proper enclosure. A proper enclosure means a securely enclosed pen or other structure of adequate size to humanely confine the vicious animal. The enclosure must prevent the entry of young children and be designed to keep the vicious animal from escaping. The enclosure must have secure sides and a secure top attached to all sides. The sides must either be buried two (2) feet into the ground or sunken into a concrete pad. The gate to the enclosure shall be inward opening and shall be kept securely locked.

The perimeter fence shall be of sufficient height to prevent the vicious animal from escaping by jumping over the fence. The perimeter fence shall be sufficiently secured to prevent the vicious animal from escaping by crawling or digging under or knocking over the fence. If there is a gate in the fence, the gate shall be kept securely locked. 
                  (3)  Except when being transported to a licensed veterinary facility, a vicious animal shall not be allowed off the property of the owner or keeper. Should transport for veterinary care be needed, the animal shall be securely and humanely confined within a vehicle. Movement of the animal from the residence of the owner to and from the transporting vehicle and to and from the veterinary facility shall be conducted with the animal securely leashed by a leash no longer than six (6) feet in length and muzzled by a muzzle or device constructed so as to prevent the animal from biting. 
                  (4)  Except as may be allowed in this article, the owner or keeper of a vicious animal shall at all times keep the vicious animal within either the residence of the owner or keeper or the proper enclosure as set forth in this section. It shall be unlawful to permit the animal to be outside the residence or the proper enclosure of the owner or keeper unless the animal is properly muzzled by a muzzle or device constructed so as to prevent the animal from biting, and the animal is attended by the owner or keeper, who is capable of controlling the animal, and the animal is restrained by a secure collar and leash of sufficient strength to prevent escape. The leash shall be no longer than six (6) feet in length. The animal must be kept at least fifteen (15) feet within the perimeter boundaries of the property, unless the perimeter boundary is securely fenced. 
                  (5)  The owner or keeper of a vicious animal must maintain at all times either a policy of insurance or a surety bond in a minimum amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) to cover claims for any personal injuries inflicted by the vicious animal, which policy or surety bond shall be issued by an insurer or surety, as the case may be, authorized to transact business in this state. A copy of the insurance policy or surety bond, and all renewals thereof, shall be provided by the owner or keeper to the animal control department. 
                  (6)  The premises where a vicious animal is kept shall be posted with clearly visible signs warning that there is an animal on the premises that presents a danger to human beings. The signs shall include a symbol sufficient to convey without words the message that there is an animal on the premises that presents a danger to human beings. The signs shall be conspicuously displayed on each exterior side of the enclosure for each fifty (50) feet of the enclosure, with a minimum of two (2) signs, in addition to a sign on each ingress and egress point to the enclosure. The signs shall be a minimum of ten (10) inches tall and fourteen (14) inches long. In addition, signs shall be placed at each door to the house if the vicious animal is kept at any time in the house. The signs shall also comply with the requirements set forth by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. A copy of the Department of Natural Resources' sign requirements are available from the animal control department. 
                  (7)  The owner or keeper of a vicious animal shall, prior to placing the animal on the premises, have the animal micro-chip registered, at the owner's expense, and provide the registration number to the animal control department. The owner or keeper shall keep the micro-chip registration information updated, and provide the animal control department with the updated registration information.

                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Mar. 11, 1991, §§ 1—6, enacted provisions requiring the installation of water-saving facilities and providing for exceptions. Such provisions did not specify manner of codification, but have been designated by the editor as § 6-20.

                  Sec. 6-21. - Covering openings of constructions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and findings. 
                  (1)  The purpose of this section is to protect against the pernicious effects which result from the placement of boards, including plywood or other wooden materials, over the doors, windows, or other coverings of constructions within the city. The pernicious effects sought to be remedied by this section include the reduction of property value caused by boarding of constructions, the spread of blight, the increase of crime associated with areas in and around such boarded constructions, and to preserve and promote the aesthetics of the city. The provisions of this section represent a balancing of the competing interests of property owners and occupants to protect the openings of constructions from naturally occurring damage and vandalism and the city's interest in protecting against decreases in property valuation, blight, and crime. 
                  (2)  The city's governing authority finds that constructions boarded with plywood or other wood based materials have been linked with decreases in the property values to both the affected property and other properties within the vicinity, are linked to an increase in crimes such as vandalism, squatting, drug crimes, and in some cases, violent crimes, and otherwise contribute to the spread of blight within a community. The city's governing authority thus finds that it is best to prohibit the usage of such boarding materials on constructions within the city in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry.

                  Construction means any building, dwelling, or other structure, or part thereof, used and occupied for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business uses, or intended to be so used, and includes any outhouses, improvements, and appurtenances belonging thereto or usually enjoyed therewith and also includes any building or structure of any design. As used in this section, the term "construction" does not mean or include any building or structure located on a farm, or any agricultural facility or other building or structure used for the production, growing, raising, harvesting, storage, or processing of crops, livestock, poultry, or other farm products. 
                  Occupant means any person or persons who lease property from an owner as defined in this section or otherwise are in possession of a property and premises. 
                  Owner means the holder of the title in fee simple and every mortgagee of record, whether a person, firm, association, or corporation. 
                  (c)  Permit required for covering openings of constructions. 
                  (1)  Owners and occupants are prohibited from erecting, installing, placing, or maintaining any covering over doors, windows, or any other openings of any construction by any means other than the conventional methods used in the original building and design of the construction without first obtaining a valid permit in accordance with this section. 
                  (2)  Any construction with boards, including plywood, or any other wood based material, or metal, or any other non-transparent covering any door, window, or other opening and existing at the time of adoption of this section will have sixty (60) days from the date of adoption to remove such boarding and submit an application to the city for a permit in accordance with this section. 
                  (3)  Notwithstanding the permit requirement imposed by subsection (b)(1), above, a permit is not required to cover the opening of a construction for up to a maximum of thirty (30) days in the event of a temporary emergency situation, including, but not limited to, damage caused by vandalism, theft, or weather. In the event an emergency situation requires the opening of a construction to be covered for more than thirty (30) days, the owner or occupant or his/her authorized representative must obtain either a valid building permit for repair or a valid permit in accordance with this section. 
                  (d)  Requirements for issuance of permit. 
                  (1)  The city may issue a permit only upon satisfaction of the following conditions: 
                  a.  Submission of a written application by the owner or occupant of the property or his authorized representative, including the following information:

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Mobile home means a movable or portable dwelling over thirty-two (32) feet in length and over eight (8) feet wide, constructed to be towed on its own chassis, connected to utilities and designed without a permanent foundation for year-round occupancy, which can consist of one (1) or more components that can be retracted for towing purposes and subsequently expanded for additional capacity, or of two (2) or more units separately towable but designed to be joined into an integral unit.

                  (c)  No permit shall be issued if the issuance of the permit in any way jeopardizes federal funds appropriated to this state under the provisions of Title 23 of the U.S. Code. 
                  (d)  No single trip permit or approved route permit shall be issued authorizing in excess of one (1) allowable travel day, which must be for a day when that type of permitted load is authorized to travel, as specified in this article. 
                  (Ord. of 12-10-79, § 2) 
                  Sec. 6-93. - Conditions attached to issuance of permits. 
                  In addition to compliance with any other conditions imposed on the issuance of a particular permit, any person receiving a permit from the city thereby certifies that he will comply or has complied (as applicable) with the following conditions governing the operation of the permitted vehicle or load. When intentional, or due to gross negligence, a violation of any of the following conditions is unlawful and punishable as a misdemeanor and may be considered as evidence supporting action to suspend, revoke or deny a permit: 
                  (1)  Federal and state laws, regulations, city ordinances. The permittee will comply or has complied with the applicable laws and regulations of the United States and of this state and city, including, but not limited to, those of the U. S. Interstate Commerce Commission, the state public service commission, the state department of public safety, the state department of revenue and OCGA Title 32. 
                  (2)  Movement of vehicle, load. Unless otherwise shown on the permit or further limited by specific rules provided in this article, the permittee will ensure that the movement of a permitted vehicle or load will take place only on Monday through Saturday, from thirty (30) minutes after sunrise to thirty (30) minutes before sunset, Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is in effect for the period of year during which the movement occurs. Provided further, he will make sure that no permitted vehicle or load will be moved during foggy weather, during snow or icy conditions or during the following legal holidays: New Year's Day, Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and December 25th. 
                  (3)  Route of travel. The permittee will not operate the permitted load or vehicle over any public road or street in the city other than those described or allowed in the permit, provided that he will comply with the load limitations of any bridge or which limitation has been established by the posting of an embargo sign on any public road in the state and the city. 
                  (4)  Distance between vehicles. The operator of a permitted vehicle and load shall maintain fifty-foot intervals between each vehicle load. In addition, when the normal flow of traffic becomes impeded, such vehicle or load shall move off the traveled portion of the public road until such traffic congestion has been cleared. Normal movement may then be resumed until another traffic congestion occurs. 
                  (5)  Escorts. The permittee will comply with the requirements of section 6-95. 
                  (6)  Marking of vehicle and load. The permittee will comply with the requirements of sections 6-94—6-96.

However, nothing in this section shall prevent the city from requiring any additional undertaking or security as may be deemed necessary to compensate the city for any injury to any public road therein, including a bridge. Upon request the person receiving a permit shall furnish the city the number of the policy of insurance required in this section as well as the address of the insurance company. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed so as to make the city liable for any damage to a public road or bridge or to persons or private property caused by a permitted load or vehicle, or its escort vehicle. The person receiving the permit thereby promises to hold the city harmless from such claims and to recompense the city or a political subdivision for any expenditures made by the city or other political subdivision for any expenditures made by the city or other political subdivision to repair damages caused by the permitted vehicle or load to a public road of the state highway system, of a county road system or of a municipal street system, as applicable. 
                  (8)  Leased vehicles. The permittee will ensure that the operator of a leased vehicle carries on his person written proof of the identity of the lessee. 
                  (9)  Single-trip permit. The permittee will not allow the single-trip permit to be used other than for the movement by the particular vehicle for which the permit was issued.

                  (2)  He has measured the house and has, prior to applying for the permit, checked the route stated in this application for permit to ensure obstacle clearance and necessary places periodically to pull off of the road for the purpose of preventing unnecessary traffic congestion; 
                  (3)  Before moving the house, all masonry will be removed from a masonry-veneered house; 
                  (4)  All mailboxes, highway signs and other movable obstacles to the move of the house shall be removed as the house approaches such an obstacle and reerected immediately after the house passes such obstacle in equal or better condition than it was prior to removal;

                  --- (8) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 01-1, §§ I—VII, adopted Jan. 8, 2001 did not specify manner of codification, hence; inclusion of these provisions as §§ 6-151—6-156 was at the discretion of the editor. 

                  Sec. 6-151. - Purpose. 
                  In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of the public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering waters unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds in the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 01-1, § I, 1-8-2001)

                  Corridor means all land within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed and within other setback areas specified in section 21-164 of this article. 
                  Impervious surface means a manmade structure or surface that prevents infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, or patios. 
                  Large water supply watershed means a watershed equal to or greater than one hundred (100) square miles of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2001-04, §§ I—VI, adopted Mar. 12, 2001 did not specify manner of codification, hence; inclusion of these provisions as §§ 6-181—6-186 was at the discretion of the editor. 

                  Sec. 6-181. - Purpose. 
                  In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic, climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city and the surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. 
                  Groundwater resources are; contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rack beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2001-05, §§ I—VII, adopted Mar. 12, 2001 did not specify manner of codification, hence; inclusion of these provisions as §§ 6-211—6-217 was at the discretion of the editor. 

                  Sec. 6-211. - Purpose. 
                  The wetlands in their indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education: scientific study, and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the state. 
                  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.

                  Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, as amended. 
                  Regulated activity means an activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

                  (d)  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the construction without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the construction must not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti.

The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (f)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid.

                  (g)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (h)  The lien provided for in subsection (e) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court of Walker County, Georgia, and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (a) of section 6-224 of this article. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within ninety (90) days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
                  (i)  The amount of the lien shall be collected in the manner as all other ad valorem taxes are collected by the city. 
                  (j)  The tax commissioner must remit the amount collected to the city. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any amount retained for administration must be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (k)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the construction on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (l)  Review of a municipal court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a construction must be by writ of certioari.

                  (3)  For interested parties whose mailing address is unknown, a notice stating the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements appear in such county once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks prior to the hearing; and 
                  (4)  A notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court in which the construction or property is located at the time of filing the complaint in the municipal court. 
                  (b)  The public officer must cause an affidavit of service to be filed of record in the municipal court prior to the hearing showing compliance with the service requirements of this section.

                  Sec. 6-225. - Limitation of liability for code enforcement; no special duty created. 
                  It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, life, safety, and general welfare of residents and visitors of the city, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. Approval of a permit and inspection of a property does not guarantee or warrant to the owner or occupants thereof that the property has been constructed, maintained, or operated in conformance with applicable codes, laws and regulations. The city reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees, or agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or later be created. To the extent any federal or state law or regulation requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan, or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees, or agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection does not constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it remains the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professional(s), and contractor(s) to satisfy such legal requirements.

                  Sec. 6-230. - Introduction. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution and 
                  Therefore, the City of LaFayette, Georgia ("city") has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. The city has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  (Ord. No. 10-03, 8-9-2010)

                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 10-03, § 3, subsections 3.1—3.8, have been redesignated as § 6-233, subsections (a)—(h). 
                  Sec. 6-234. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
                  (a)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  (1)  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  (2)  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and, 
                  (3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (b)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three (3) approaches: 
                  (1)  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  (2)  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event. 
                  (3)  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (c)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm under subsection (b) of this section is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the twenty-five-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  (d)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the one hundred-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  (e)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (f)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one (1) or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (a) of this section. The applicant may, if approved by the city take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (g)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public right-of-ways.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 11-1. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
                  (a)  Authorization. Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of LaFayette, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (b)  Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of LaFayette, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (d)  Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and; 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
                  (Ord. No. 07/6, Art. 1, §§ A—D, 8-14-2007)

                  Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by an independent perimeter load-bearing wall, shall be considered "new construction". 
                  Appeal means a request for a review of the building official or city engineer's interpretation of any provision of this chapter. 
                  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one (1) to three (3) feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
                  Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in section 11-3. 
                  Base flood means the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
                  Basement means that portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

                  Elevated building means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before February 9, 1987 [i.e., the effective date of the FIRST floodplain management code or ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for that community's participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)]. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before February 9, 1987 [i.e., the effective date of the FIRST floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
                  (2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Flood insurance study the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is; 
                  (1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

                  a.  By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior, or 
                  b.  Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one (1) or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after February 9, 1987 and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure. [* i.e., the effective date of the FIRST floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for community participation in the (NFIP)]. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after February 9, 1987. [i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) as corrected in 1988 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis;

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 11-26. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings—All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and, 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 11-27. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 11-26(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 11-18(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 11-26(6) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a, c, above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 11-3, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. 
                  Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article III.

                  Sec. 11-28. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 11-3, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 11-3, then the building official or city engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of article III. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one (1) foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 11-26(4) "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The building official or city engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Sec. 11-45. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The board of zoning appeals as established by the City of LaFayette shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official or city engineer in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of zoning appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Walker County Georgia, as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building official or city engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

               <head>Chapter 18.2 - SIGNS </head>
               <p>
                  Sec. 18.2-1. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  The city finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever-increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owner's original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises. 
                  (b)  Regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the city's citizens. 
                  (c)  The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The city council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a proprietary purpose, such as identifying markings on utility polls, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefitting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power. 
                  (d)  The city finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, the bulk of the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

                  (9)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that such projects shall conform to the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. section 12-7-6; provided, further, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road and tollway authority which disturb five (5) or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to the provisions of O.C.G.A. section 12-7-7.1; 
                  (10)  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, provided that any such land-disturbing activity shall conform to the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. section 12-7-6; and 
                  (11)  Public water system reservoirs. 
                  (b)  Where subsection (a) of this Code section requires compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. section 12-7-6, issuing authorities shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements as if a permit had been issued and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders. 
                  (Ord. of 6-12-95, § III; Ord. No. 2001-08, § III, 6-11-2001; Ord. No. 02-06, § 1(a)—(d), 7-8-2002) 
                  Sec. 18.5-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b)(c) of this chapter. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMP's. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b)(c) of this chapter shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this chapter; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five (25) foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  (16)  There is established a fifty (50) foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five (25) foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b)(c) of this chapter. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 6-12-95, § IV; Ord. No. 2001-08, § IV, 6-11-2001) 
                  Sec. 18.5-5. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority. However, the property owner is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the codes enforcement department to perform such activity. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the codes enforcement department and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this chapter. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of subsection 18.5-4(b)(c) of this chapter. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four (4) copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. 
                  (3)  A fee, in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority.

                  Sec. 19-91. - Utility registration. 
                  (a)  Registration required. Each utility who occupies, uses or has facilities in the rights-of-way at the time of passage of this article, including by lease, sublease or assignment to operate facilities located in the rights-of-way, unless specifically exempted by state or federal law or this Code, must file a registration statement with the department within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this article. 
                  (b)  Registration procedure. The registration information provided to the city must be on a form approved by the city and include, but not be limited to: 
                  (1)  The name, legal status (i.e. partnership, corporation, etc.), street address, email address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the utility filing the registration statement (the "registrant"). If the registrant is not the owner of the facility in the right-of-way, the registration must include the name, street address, email address if applicable, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the owner; 
                  The name, street address, email address and telephone and facsimile numbers of one (1) or more facilities representative(s). Current information regarding how to contact the facilities representative(s) in an emergency must be provided at the time of filing a registration and must be updated as necessary to assure accurate contact information is available to the city at all times. 
                  (2)  A copy, if requested, of the utility's certificate of authority (or other acceptable evidence of authority to operate) from the Georgia Public Service Commission or the FCC and any other similar approvals, permits, or agreements. 
                  (3)  A copy, if requested, of the utility's certificate of authority (or other acceptable evidence of authority to operate) from the Georgia Public Service Commission or the FCC and any other similar approvals, permits, or agreements. 
                  (4)  A copy, if requested, of the service agreement or other legal instrument that authorizes the utility to use or occupy the right-of-way for the purpose described in the registration. 
                  (c)  Incomplete registration. If a registration is incomplete, the director must promptly notify the registrant and must provide a reasonable period of time in which to complete the registration. When a registration is complete, the director will accept it and so notify the utility in writing. 
                  (d)  Acceptance of the registration does not convey title in the rights-of-way. Acceptance of the registration is only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the city for the limited purposes stated in the acceptance. Acceptance of the registration does not excuse a utility from obtaining permits required by city codes nor from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before using the facilities of others, including the city. Acceptance of the registration does not excuse a utility from notifying the city of construction as required in this article. 
                  (e)  Facilities in place without registration. Beginning one (1) year after the effective date of this article, any facilities or part of a facility found in a right-of-way for which registration is required but has not been obtained, unless specifically exempted by law, and for which no valid service agreement exists with the city, may be deemed to be a nuisance and an unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prosecuting the violator; or any other remedy provided by City codes or otherwise allowed in law or in equity.

                  Sec. 19-92. - Construction permits. 
                  (a)  Permit required. It is unlawful for any utility to excavate or to construct, install, maintain, renew, remove or relocate facilities in, on, above, within, over, below, under, along or through the public roads of the city without a utility permit from the department of public works in accordance with the terms of this article. 
                  (b)  Permit procedure. Utility permits must be obtained from the director (or such other person as the city manager may designate) upon application made on forms prescribed by the department of public works. The written application must include the following: 
                  (1)  The name and address of the utility; 
                  (2)  The nature, extent, and location of any work proposed to be done, along with satisfactory plans as attachments showing in detail the location of the proposed facility or operations as described in the permit application. The plans must show the size or capacity of facilities to be installed; their relationship to street features such as right-of-way lines, pavement edge, structures, etc., horizontal and vertical clearance to critical elements of the roadway and any other information necessary to evaluate the impact on the street and its operation; 
                  (3)  The name and address of the person or firm who is to do such work; 
                  (4)  The name, street address, email address and telephone and facsimile numbers of one (1) or more facilities representative(s); 
                  (5)  The projected dates for the work to be started and completed; 
                  (6)  An indemnity bond or other acceptable security in an amount to be set by the city to pay any damages to any part of the city road system or other city property or to any city employee or member of the public caused by activity or work of the utility performed under authority of the permit issued; 
                  (7)  A copy, if requested, of the registrant's certificate of authority (or other acceptable evidence of authority to operate) from the Georgia Public Service Commission or the FCC and any other similar approvals, permits, or agreements; and 
                  (8)  A copy, if requested, of the service agreement or other legal instrument that authorizes the utility to use or occupy the right-of-way for the purpose described in the application. 
                  (c)  Permit fees. Fees will be determined by resolution of the mayor and council, as from time to time amended. A fee schedule will be available at the offices of the director and the city manager and open for public inspection and copying, without charge. 
                  (d)  Issuance of permit. If the director determines the applicant has satisfied the following requirements, the director may issue a permit. 
                  (1)  Whether issuing of the approval will be consistent with this article; 
                  (2)  Whether applicant has submitted a complete application and has secured all certificates and other authorizations required by law in order to construct facilities in the manner proposed by the applicant; and 
                  (3)  The impact on safety, visual quality of the streets, traffic flow, and other users of the right-of-way and the difficulty and length of time of the project, construction or maintenance. 
                  (e)  Emergency situations. 
                  (1)  Each utility must, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the director of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The utility may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. A utility who engages in an emergency excavation must take all reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize damage to any existing facilities. 
                  (2)  In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding utility facilities, the city may attempt to contact the affected utility or facilities representative. The city may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, including cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or other parts of the facilities. The city does not incur any liability to the utility for such emergency actions, and the cost of such must be paid by each utility affected by the emergency. 
                  (f)  Effective period of permit. 
                  (1)  Each permit must have a set commencement and expiration date based on information provided in the applicant's permit application. 
                  (2)  The permit must remain in place until construction is completed or until its stated expiration date, unless the utility is in default. The director may give written notice of default to a utility if it is determined that a utility has: 
                  a.  Violated any provision or requirement of the issuance or acceptance of a permit application or any law of the city, state, or federal government; 
                  b.  Attempted to evade any provision or requirement of this chapter; 
                  c.  Practiced any fraud or deceit upon the city; or 
                  d.  Made a material misrepresentation or omission of fact in its permit application. 
                  (g)  Cancellation for cause. If a utility fails to cure a default within twenty (20) business days after notice is provided to the utility by the city, then the default is a material breach and the city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity to terminate the permit. If the director determines there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure will be followed: 
                  (1)  City will serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a utility a minimum of fifteen (15) calendar days to cure its breach. 
                  (2)  If the utility fails to cure within fifteen (15) calendar days, the city may declare the permit terminated. 
                  (h)  Expiration of permit. If work is not begun within six (6) months of the date of issuance, the permit will automatically expire.

                  Sec. 19-93. - Required minimum standards. 
                  (a)  Utility accommodation manual adopted. The 2016 GDOT Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards Manual, including all references contained to codes, rules, regulations, schedules, forms and appendix items, except appendix B (permit forms and supporting documents), promulgated by the State of Georgia Department of Transportation, as may be amended from time to time, is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated in this article as if fully set forth in this article, subject to the amendments and modification contained in this article. A copy of the manual will be maintained in the offices of the director or his or her designee and open for public inspection and copying. Copies of the manual are also available on the Georgia Department of Transportation's website. Any conflicts between the provisions of this article and the manual will be resolved in favor of the manual. References to state personnel, agencies, and fees will be interpreted, where required, as meaning the City of LaFayette municipal equivalents. 
                  (b)  Protection of traffic and roadway. Unless specifically stated in the permit, no utility may occupy city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the department from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way or the right-of-way itself. 
                  (c)  Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time by the city or by federal or state highway authorities during the term of the permit and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility must, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon reasonable notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city will have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility, and the utility must pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation. 
                  (d)  Installation of poles and other wireholding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities must be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners. 
                  (e)  Utilities protection. As provided in O.C.G.A § 25-9-6 (the Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act) and other applicable state law currently in place or as amended, no utility may commence, perform, or engage in blasting or in excavating with mechanized excavating facilities unless and until the utility planning the blasting or excavating has given forty-eight (48) hours' notice by submitting a locate request to the utility protection center, beginning the next business day, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 25-9-3(3), after such notice is provided, excluding hours during days other than business days.

                  Sec. 19-94. - Restoration of property. 
                  (a)  Each utility is responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the rights-of-way and adjoining property or other facilities which it or its facilities damage. 
                  (b)  A utility is liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace, restore or repair, any street, facilities or property or structure on, under, over or adjacent to the right-of-way that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of the construction or installation, operation, upgrade, repair or removal of facilities to a condition as good as or better than its condition before the work performed by the utility that caused such disturbance or damage. If the utility does not commence such replacement or repair within twenty (20) business days following written notice from the city, the city or the owner of the affected structure or property may make such replacement or repair and the utility must pay the reasonable and actual cost of the same.

                  Sec. 19-95. - Inspection. 
                  (a)  The utility must make the construction site available to the director and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction. 
                  (b)  At any time, including the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate cessation of any work, which poses a serious threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates the terms and conditions of the permit or this article, or issue an order to correct work which does not conform to the permit or applicable standards, conditions, or codes. 
                  (c)  When the construction under any permit is completed, the utility must notify the department.

                  Sec. 19-96. - Other approvals, permits and agreements. 
                  (a)  Additional permits required. The utility must obtain all construction, building or other permits or approvals as according to city codes, state or federal law. In addition, a permittee must comply with all requirements of laws, must complete work in a way as not to cause any unnecessary or unauthorized obstructions of sidewalks, streets, waterways or railways, and is responsible for all work done in the rights-of-way regardless of who performs the work. No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except in the case of an emergency as defined in subsection 19-90(c)(6) and as outlined in subsection 19-92(e).

                  Sec. 19-97. - Penalties. 
                  (a)  A utility convicted of a violation of any provision of this article may be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation. Each act of violation and each day on which any violation occurs constitutes a separate offense. In addition to a fine, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisance, injunctive relief, and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  (b)  Citations returnable to the Municipal Court of LaFayette, Georgia are valid when served personally upon the utility's designated facilities representative, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or statutory overnight delivery at the address provided.

                  Sec. 19-98. - Other provisions. 
                  (a)  Reservation of regulatory and police powers. The city by issuing a written approval of registration under this chapter, does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or may be later vested in the city under the constitution and laws of the United States, State of Georgia and the City Charter, and under the provisions of the city's codified ordinances to regulate the use of the rights-of-way. By applying for and being issued a written permit, the utility acknowledges that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or may be, from time to time, vested in or reserved to the city, are in full force and effect and subject to exercise by the city at any time. A utility acknowledges that its interests are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and agrees to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the city under its powers. In particular, all utilities must comply with city zoning and other land use requirements pertaining to the placement and specifications of facilities. 
                  (b)  Compliance. No person is relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter by reason of any failure of city to enforce compliance. 
                  (c)  Appeal of administrative decisions. Any appeals provided for by this article and any notification to the city required by this article must be in writing and sent via certified mail to the city manager as specified in this article.

                  (a)  Scope of permit. 
                  (1)  A permit issued by the city authorizes an applicant to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant any authority whatsoever to the applicant to impinge upon the rights of others who may already have an interest in the rights-of-way. 
                  (2)  A permit for the placement of small wireless facilities within the city rights-of-way may include a provision reasonably addressing the obligations of the parties if there is a substantial change of law at the federal, state, or local level. 
                  (3)  The city may, in its sole discretion, review the terms and conditions of any permit issued under this article after five (5) years to determine if the terms and conditions for the use of city's rights-of-way are still in the best interests of the city in accordance with the laws and regulations in effect at the time. If city determines that the terms and conditions of the permit are no longer in the best interest of the city under the terms of this article, the city may revoke the permit or may make changes to the permit as necessary to meet the best interests of the city. 
                  (4)  Unless construction has actually begun and is diligently pursued to completion at that point, no permit for construction issued under this chapter is valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months unless both the city and the applicant agree to a reasonable extension and all required fees are paid for the term regardless of construction. 
                  (b)  Construction and maintenance requirements. 
                  (1)  Small wireless facilities and wireless attachments must be constructed and maintained in a manner that does not interfere with the operation of the department's equipment, the operation of other utility equipment, the general public safety, and traffic flow. If it becomes necessary for a permittee's construction or maintenance activities to disrupt traffic flow, appropriate safety and traffic flow measures must be employed to safeguard against accidents and keep traffic moving in an efficient manner. 
                  (2)  Upon completion of any construction or maintenance of its small wireless facilities, the WIP must return the surface of the city's right-of-way to its prior condition, including any sidewalks, curbing, paving, landscaping or other improvements in place prior to the construction. WIP must not leave sidewalks in an uneven condition and must use similar materials and construction in its repair of the right-of-way such that the appearance of the improvements is substantially identical to its prior condition. If the right-of-way is not returned to a substantially identical condition after construction or maintenance activities, the city may, in its sole discretion, request the WIP to make the appropriate repairs within five (5) days of receiving notice from the city. If the repairs are not made by the WIP within said time, the city may perform the repairs on its own and require reimbursement of any expenses associated therewith. When such repairs are made by the city, written notice will be sent requesting reimbursement upon completion of the repairs, and WIP will have thirty (30) days from the date of the notice to reimburse the city for the expenses. 
                  (3)  The city retains the authority to exclude certain days, holidays and special events periods during which the WIP may not perform construction or maintenance activities on its small wireless facilities and must be out of the rights-of-way. The department may also require that WIP and their agents not perform construction or maintenance work during certain times of the day in order to lessen the impact on traffic or otherwise address safety concerns. Such times will be as approved by the city council or the director. Prior to commencing construction or maintenance, permittee or its agent must verify that its planned work does not fall into an excluded time period. 
                  (4)  Any small wireless facilities or associated construction and maintenance activities must comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) (29 U.S.C. § 794) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131—12164). The city is not liable for any small wireless facilities or any actions of the WIP which violate the ADA. If at any time the city determines the right-of-way is not in compliance due to the actions or facilities of WIP, the city may, in its sole discretion, request the WIP to make the appropriate repairs within five (5) days of sending of the notice from the city. If the repairs are not made by the WIP, the city may perform the repairs on its own and require reimbursement of any expenses associated therewith. When repairs are made by the city under this subsection, written notice will be sent requesting reimbursement upon completion of the repairs, and WIP will have thirty (30) days from the date of the notice to reimburse the city for its expenses.

                  Sec. 19-104. - Requirements for the siting of distributed and small cell wireless antennas in the city's rights-of-way. 
                  (a)  An attachment agreement or other authorization for placement on the pole or wireless support structure is required for siting of all SWFs. Siting of SWFs is subject to the following requirements: 
                  (1)  For any SWF proposed to be located on any pole other than a city-approved pole, the WIP must replace the existing pole with a city-approved pole unless such replacement is shown to be impractical under the circumstances; the city has the authority to determine whether replacement is impractical, and if that determination is made, the city has the right to require placement of the proposed small wireless facilities in such a manner as to minimize its impacts to the right-of-way, including conditions intended to ensure the safety of its citizens and to protect the aesthetics of the surrounding area. 
                  (2)  Installations in/on utility poles not located within protected areas are limited to in-line tangent poles without transformers and those classified as secondary service poles. 
                  (3)  To the greatest extent practical, SWFs must not be perceptible by a person of average height from two hundred fifty (250) feet away; if a dispute arises as to this paragraph, the director will make the final determination as to compliance with this paragraph. 
                  (4)  SWF installations on all poles must utilize a concealed design, with all cabling being inside a hollow pole or otherwise hidden from view without banding or external conduit or panduit. 
                  (5)  All radios, network equipment and batteries must be enclosed inside the pole or on the pole inside a concealment device approved by the department. 
                  (6)  SWFs are not permitted on poles with traffic lights or poles that are identified as sign poles. 
                  (7)  SWFs are not permitted at signalized intersections of city-owned rights-of-way. 
                  (8)  SWFs must be designed in a manner that does not endanger public safety or impede traffic flow on roads and sidewalks. 
                  (9)  Any new poles installed must not leach any volatile organic compounds or toxic materials. 
                  (10)  Any new poles installed should be constructed in a manner to avoid unsightly rust and corrosion. The finish on the pole should conform to city standards, including selection of color, finish method, such as "baked on" or color that is tightly integrated into the material composition of the pole to prevent color fading or erosion or peeling of paint from the exterior of the pole. 
                  (11)  SWFs placed on a city-owned pole must not interfere with or block any banners or other attachments owned by the city. The SWF must be aesthetically compatible with the surrounding area through application of camouflage and concealment design techniques. 
                  (12)  Any new, modified, or replacement pole or wireless support structure installed in the rights-of-way located outside of a protected area must not exceed five (5) feet above the tallest pre-existing poles or wireless support structures within two hundred (200) feet of the proposed new wireless facility, located on the same side of the street and within the same right-of-way, except that no pole may exceed sixty-five (65) feet above ground level (AGL). 
                  (13)  Any poles located in protected areas or streetscaped corridors, must be consistent in height with the other decorative poles located in the right-of-way. The city will not allow new poles in any protected area without a variance from city council, and any replacement poles must match the height of the existing pole it replaces. 
                  (14)  SWFs proposed to be located with two hundred fifty (250) feet of another SWF must be collocated with other small wireless facilities or neutrally hosted, unless applicant provides sufficient evidence that coverage and capacity needs cannot be met using collocated or neutrally hosted wireless attachments; any small wireless facilities must be designed and constructed in a manner that allows other competing WIPs and carriers to be collocated on/in the same pole or placed on/in nearby poles. It is the express intent of this chapter that in areas where one (1) WIP has installed SWF, all other providers and carriers are permitted to install SWF in the same area consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including 47 U.S. Code § 224, and other applicable provisions. If collocation or nearby placement is not feasible in certain rights-of-way, WIPs are prohibited from installing SWF in that area of the right-of-way, and the department has authority to deny or revoke any permits for SWF in that area if it is shown that WIP are being blocked by competing WIP from locating there. As SWF technology continues to develop and smaller and more concealed designs are available, the city may review permits and require that WIP upgrade older SWFs so that more WIP may collocate or decrease the footprint of SWFs in the rights-of-way. 
                  (b)  Protected areas. 
                  (1)  The city council may designate certain areas of the city in which utilities have been placed underground, or in which streetscaping, historic preservation, or other considerations require the design and construction of small wireless facilities in a manner that conforms to the existing aesthetic and structural schemes. 
                  (2)  The protected areas are identified on the protected area maps included with this chapter and adopted concurrently herewith. The city council may update the protected area maps as additional areas within the city are designated as protected areas. The department will maintain a corresponding list of city-approved pole(s) for each protected area identified on the map. 
                  (3)  SWFs located in protected areas with existing decorative poles must use poles that conform to the height and aesthetics of the existing decorative poles. The department will maintain a list of city-approved poles for each protected area and a list of design specifications for SWF placed in each protected area, including height limits, equipment placement, and concealment requirements. 
                  (4)  Where SWFs are not prohibited, any poles located in protected areas or streetscaped corridors must be consistent in height with the other decorative poles located in the right-of-way. The city will not allow new poles in any protected area without a variance from city council, and any replacement poles must match the height of the existing pole it replaces. 
                  (5)  Pole-mounted cabinets approved by the city in protected areas must conform to the design and placement specifications determined by the department for each protected area, but cabinets on the ground are wholly prohibited in protected areas. 
                  (6)  Where the city has or hereafter decides to relocate utility facilities underground or replace poles with decorative poles, the city will designate such area as a protected area and must attempt to work with the WIP to accommodate placement of SWFs on city-approved poles within that area if the SWFs conform to poles used in the area. Once a new protected area has been designated, WIP, at its expense, must remove the SWFs and may apply for a permit for any new SWF. Once utilities have been moved underground and SWF have been removed pursuant to this subsection WIP may not place SWF and associate equipment back into the right-of-way without a variance from city council. 
                  (Ord. No. 19-01, § 1, 1-14-2019) 
                  Sec. 19-105. - Attachment to city-owned or utility-owned poles in the city's rights-of-way. 
                  (a)  A permit issued under this article does not confer any right to attach small wireless facilities, wireless attachments, or ancillary equipment, or to remove or replace any city, utility or privately-owned pole with a SWF without having an attachment agreement or other authorization from the owner of the pole or wireless support structure. The city may cause a permit for wireless attachments to a city-owned structure under this article to be made conditional upon the execution of a finalized attachment agreement. Any removed and replaced pole must conform to city-approved pole. 
                  (b)  For city-owned poles in the rights-of-way, the city will provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to install the requested SWF, including pole replacement and if necessary, a new pole or enable the existing pole to support collocated wireless attachments and ancillary equipment within thirty (30) days after receipt of a completed request. Make-ready work including any pole replacement must be completed within sixty (60) days of written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the WIP. 
                  (c)  A WIP is authorized to remove its wireless attachment and ancillary equipment from a pole upon ninety (90) days' written notice to the city and cease paying the annual rate to the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 19-01, § 1, 1-14-2019) 
                  Sec. 19-106. - Removal, relocation, or modification of small wireless facilities in the city's rights-of-way. 
                  (a)  In the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, consistent with the city's ordinances and master plans, and in the reasonable exercise of its police powers, the city may make or cause to be made improvements, repairs, or replacements of the public facilities located on public rights-of-way. Such construction activity may require adjustment or relocation of installations of public utilities, and small wireless facilities owned and maintained by wireless service providers. The right of public utilities to use public rights-of-way is permissive and subordinate to the reasonable exercise of the city's police power. The cost of relocating a SWF installation when the city reasonably exercises its police power is thus borne by the WIP. In such instances, the city will work in good faith with the wireless providers to identify and provide suitable alternative locations for the placement of the removed wireless facilities if available and consistent with this chapter. In areas designated by the city as protected areas the city may decline to provide alternative locations for placement of SWF that are removed in order to promote the city's protection of that corridor. 
                  (b)  Whenever the city determines that relocation of a SWF is necessary under this provision, the city will give WIP sixty (60) days' notice within which to relocate or otherwise remove the SWF. If the WIP does not relocate as directed by the city, the city may disconnect and remove the wireless attachment, ancillary equipment or the entire SWF at the WIP's expense. When removal is performed by the city, written notice will be sent requesting reimbursement after completion of the removal, and WIP will have thirty (30) days to reimburse such expenses after the sending of the notice. Failure to timely reimburse will terminate right to be in city's right-of-way. 
                  (c)  The city retains the right to cut or move or disconnect any SWF located within its rights-of-way as the city, in its sole discretion, may determine to be necessary, appropriate, or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the city will notify the WIP and provide it an opportunity to move its own SWF, prior to the city cutting or removing such facility and the city will notify the WIP after cutting or removing the SWF. The city is not liable for any damages to SWFs or other infrastructure that is cut or removed during such emergencies. When such removal is performed by the city, written notice will be sent requesting reimbursement after completion of the removal, and WIP will have thirty (30) days from the date of the notice to reimburse the city for its expenses.

                  Sec. 19-107. - Fees and rentals. 
                  (a)  The following schedule establishes the amount of payment due for fees and rentals associated with the use of the city's rights-of-way for small wireless facilities: 
                  (1)  A wireless provider authorized to place small wireless facilities in the rights-of-way must pay to the city compensation for use of the rights-of-way in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) annually per SWF. In addition, an annual right-of-way mitigation fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per SWF is assessed and placed in a separate fund set aside for the purpose for mitigating visual and aesthetic damages caused to the city's rights-of-way. 
                  (2)  The annual rate to attach or collocate a SWF on a city-owned pole is nine hundred ($900.00) per year for each installed SWF. Such compensation together with the application fee or asset contribution, and the rights-of-way fee specified in this article constitute the sole compensation that the WIP is required to pay the city or utility. But, if the WIP is also installing its own fiber optic technology to a particular location, the WIP must also provide the city with an opportunity to lay conduit or fiber for city use, at the city's expense, to the location utilizing any open trenching or boring construction by the WIP during the WIP's installation, including stubbing up the conduit within the city-approved pole. 
                  (b)  A WIP is authorized to remove its SWFs, wireless attachments, or other ancillary equipment at any time from the pole in the rights-of-way or other wireless support structure and may cease paying the city compensation for use of the rights-of-way as of the next due date for payment following the removal if all equipment is removed.

                  (2)  Water meters will be tested at the request of the consumer upon payment to the city of the actual costs of making the test; provided that if the meter is found to over-register beyond five (5) percent of the correct volume, no charge will be made by the city to the consumer.

Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan by July 1, 1984. No user who commences contribution to the wastewater system after the effective date of this article shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
                  (b)  Furthermore, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  Written notice; Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge or slug loading, the user shall submit to the city engineer a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve use user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the wastewater system, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
                  (2)  Notice to employees: A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

                  (a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c), below, are met. 
                  (c)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  (1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
                  (2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
                  (3)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset. (If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days): 
                  a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (e)  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (f)  Industrial users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

                  An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense in any action brought against it alleging a violation of the general prohibitions established in subsection 21-119(a) or the specific prohibitions established in subsections 21-119(b)(3) through 21-119(b)(7) where the industrial user can demonstrate that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference; and that either: 
                  (a)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each local limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
                  (b)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the industrial user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

                  (a)  For the purposes of this section, 
                  (1)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
                  (2)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (b)  An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  (1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  (2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the industrial user it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
                  (d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless; 
                  a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
                  c.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (2)  The city may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 01-2, § 1, adopted Jan. 8, 2001 did not specify manner of codification, hence; inclusion of these provisions were codified as superseding former Art. VI, §§ 21-141—21-145 which pertained to water conservation plan and derived from Ord. No. 6-88, §§ 1—6(d), adopted June 17, 1988. 
                  Cross reference— Installation of water-saving facilities, § 6-20; Consumer's responsibility and liability for use of city water, § 21-14. 

                  Sec. 21-141. - Purpose and scope. 
                  This article described two (2) related policies of the city for the management of the city water system. First is the drought contingency plan for temporary implementation during a water shortage emergency. The second is LaFayette's Water Conservation Plan, a program of policies for long-range conservation of water. 
                  The purpose of LaFayette's Drought Contingency Plan ("plan") is to provide guidelines for the city to follow in the event of water shortage emergencies. The plan establishes priorities of water use and provides for allocation of available water during four (4) stages of water shortage, in increasing order of severity of the shortage. 
                  Conditions that could cause implementation of the plan could be anything that causes a decrease in water availability from the city water facilities, such as failure of one (1) or more pumps, prolonged power outage, control malfunction, or water main breaks, sudden increases in water demand because of fire emergencies, excessive heat, cold, or drought. When demand for water exceeds the city's water system's capacity, action must be taken to prevent serious shortages and disruption of water service and fire protection to the customers. In a growing community, such as in Lafayette and Walker County, it is probable that the growth in water demand may sometimes exceed the water system's capacity to produce water. Problems and delays could arise in obtaining and developing sufficient sources of water, in financing and constructing needed treatment facilities, pumping stations, storage tanks, and distribution pipes, etc. Even with the best planning and construction, it is not considered economically feasible to provide excess capacity for every possible contingency, for excessive growth, or for every drought. 
                  While the plan is intended to deal with short-term shortages that may occur from time to time, the plan is a program of policies adopted by the city to promote long-term efficient use and conservation of the water resources available to the city and Walker County, thus minimizing the frequency and duration of emergency water shortages. 
                  (Ord. No. 01-2, § 1, 1-8-2001) 
                  Sec. 21-142. - Existing facilities. 
                  The city operates and maintains a public water supply system serving the city, and certain areas outside the corporate limits of the city. The city operates a surface water plant, a spring and a well, which is treated through a package plant. The city also has a contractual agreement with Walker County Water and Sewer Authority and Catoosa County Utilities. 
                  (Ord. No. 01-2, § 1, 1-8-2001) 
                  Sec. 21-143. - Determination of low flow conditions. 
                  The city checks stream flows and spring levels on a daily basis. Low flow conditions, among other observed conditions of the system, and input from the Georgia EPD will trigger the decisions on the severity of the plan.

                  Sec. 21-144. - Drought contingency plan. 
                  (a)  Water use priorities a general ranking of priority water uses in decreasing order of importance are to be as follows: 
                  (1)  Household use. 
                  (2)  Public necessity. 
                  (3)  Livestock. 
                  (4)  Industry and commercial use. 
                  (5)  Construction. 
                  (6)  Irrigation. 
                  (7)  Nonessential fire fighting. 
                  (8)  Swimming pools. 
                  (9)  Car washing. 
                  (10)  Street cleaning, line flushing, hydrant testing, etc. 
                  (b)  Implementing the drought contingency plan. Implementing the plan will be contingent upon numerous interrelated factors that may cause a temporary shortage of water. In general, any event or series of events which disrupts, or threatens to disrupt the city's water supply and distribution system will be carefully evaluated and the appropriate stage of the plan will be implemented in response. In certain cases, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) may order the plan to be implemented whether or not the city has acted. 
                  (c)  Implementation stages. The plan will be implemented in four (4) stages, depending on the severity of the water shortage. Each stage has specific goals for reducing water consumption. 
                  Stage No. 1—Minor water emergency 
                  The city will, when minor conditions occur, first put the following priority conservation methods in place. Under minor conditions when a request is made hereunder by the city manager, compliance shall be on a voluntary basis. 
                  • Public service announcements will be made on local radio stations and in the newspaper requesting that customers curtail the use of unnecessary water in watering lawns and gardens, washing cars, and other practices that are not essential during emergency conditions. 
                  • Fire departments and others will be asked to curtail water main flushing, dust control, and other nonessential use of water. 
                  Stage No. 2—Moderate water emergency 
                  If water shortages continue, such that up to fifteen (15) percent to eighteen (18) percent reduction in water use is deemed necessary, the city will declare a moderate water emergency condition and will take the following additional actions: 
                  • Make additional news releases to the news media and advise of the increased intensity of the water shortage by explaining the degree of severity of the water shortage problem and the need for additional curtailment of water use. 
                  • Make additional and more urgent appeals to all customers, especially the significant industrial users, for additional voluntary reductions of water use with a goal of eighteen (18) percent reduction. 
                  • Use city employees to read meters of significant industrial users to gauge the extent of their water reduction. 
                  • Use city employees and law enforcement agencies to monitor outdoor use of water by all customers. 
                  • Prohibit all outdoor use of water for car washing (except at commercial facilities), watering lawns, garden and landscape watering, pavement hosing, and filling swimming pools 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. 
                  • Water customers observed using water in violation of Stage No. 2 restrictions will be warned by the city and requested to comply with the plan. If after one (1) such warning and request, the customer fails to comply, then the customer's water service will be cut off at the meter and a reconnection fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) will be charged to return the customer to service. If said service is cut off and then reconnected, any additional violation of Stage No. 2 restrictions by said customer will cause the city to cut off service at the meter until emergency water shortage conditions have improved to the point where Stage No. 2 restrictions are lifted by the city and a reconnection fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) will be charged to return the customer to service. 
                  Stage No. 3—Severe water emergency 
                  In cases where up to thirty (30) percent reduction in water use is deemed necessary, the city will declare a severe water emergency condition and may add the following actions: 
                  • Notify the news media that a severe water emergency has been declared and request cooperation in reaching all water customers with the need to further curtail water use. 
                  • Hand deliver letters to individual large water users outlining the severity of the problem and requesting significant voluntary curtailment of water use. Industrial users will be requested to reduce average consumption by at least thirty (30) percent of their normal use and advised that city employees will read water meters to monitor the level of reduction achieved. 
                  • Prohibit all water usage by governmental agencies not required for health and safety. 
                  • Prohibit all outside water usage at all times by all customers except that water use which is essential or required for health or safety. 
                  • Prohibit all once-through cooling water use or water-cooled air-conditioners with recirculation. 
                  • Prohibit the escape of water through breaks or excessive leaks in plumbing facilities by cutoff of the water service of offending customers. 
                  • Require commercial car washing and commercial laundries to reduce water use up to fifty (50) percent of normal use as demonstrated by meter readings. 
                  • If a water customer violates the Stage No. 3 restrictions, after one (1) request is made of the customer for compliance, the customer's water service will be cut off and a reconnection fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) will be charged to return the customer to service. If said service is cut off and then reconnected, any other violation of Stage No. 3 restrictions by said customer will cause the city to cut off service at the meter until the emergency water shortage conditions have unproved to the point where Stage No. 3 restrictions are lifted by the city. A reconnection fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) will be charged to return the customer to service. 
                  Stage No. 4—Critical water emergency 
                  If a water shortage emergency becomes so severe that it is declared critical water emergency and a fifty (50) percent or greater reduction is deemed necessary, the city will add the following additional actions: 
                  • Additional prohibitions will be imposed on the use of any water activities not essential or required for health and safety. 
                  • After twenty-four-hour notice to industrial users, the flow of water to the users will be shut off or reduced to the absolute minimum necessary to protect health and safety. 
                  • Prohibit all water use for commercial car washing, commercial laundries, construction activities, and irrigation for agriculture. 
                  • Notify all water customers that any water use greater than their average monthly use (on an annual basis) will be penalized by a fine of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month until the emergency has subsided. 
                  • The city may also issue any other requirements to reduce water use in other specific ways, using the priority list herein as a guide to the degree of curtailment. 
                  • All city personnel will monitor unnecessary use of water and report violations of Stage No. 4 restrictions. 
                  • Upon a customer's first violation of Stage No. 4 restrictions, the customer's water will be discontinued, upon notification to the customer, until the water shortage conditions have improved to the point where the city lifts Stage No. 4 restrictions. A reconnection fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) will be charged to return the customer's service. 
                  (Ord. No. 01-2, § 1, 1-8-2001) 
                  Sec. 21-145. - Water conservation plan. 
                  (a)  Management of water system losses. EPD guidelines recommend that system losses be reduced to ten (10) percent or less. The city is currently attempting to minimize unaccounted water use and it is evident that continuing efforts will be needed to bring the water losses within acceptable limits. 
                  Typically, water system losses are the result of system leaks, line breaks, unmetered sales, uncalibrated or faulty meters, and unmetered uses such as fire hydrant use and line flushing. Sometimes the water is allowed to bleed off in certain locations during cold weather to prevent freezing. 
                  The following policies will be initiated by the city to ensure that the water system returns to an acceptable water loss ratio: 
                  • All distribution system leaks will be repaired as quickly as possible. City employees, including members of fire and police departments, are trained to report any water line leaks or breaks. 
                  • Best construction practices have been implemented (hot taps on large water mains and looping dead end lines) to reduce water losses due to flushing. 
                  • The city's water meter maintenance program will be expanded to include checking and calibration of all large meters (one and one-half (1½ in. and larger) and the large meters at the water sources. Residential meters will be automatically replaced whenever readings begin to vary unaccountably or do not register within the expected range. 
                  • The city will continue to maintain monthly records reflecting the difference between water production and metered sales. The city will then take additional steps to identify and eliminate the source or sources of system losses. 
                  • The city water system maps showing the location and size of all lines, valves, and hydrants will be periodically updated as new mains are added and as information is discovered during repair or replacement operations. 
                  • The city will continue to evaluate all water service meters to insure they are adequately sized for the average and peak flow rates. Meters that are inadequately sized will be replaced with the recommended meter sizes. 
                  • The storage tanks are observed continually for evidence of overflowing. Automatic level controlled equipment will be kept in proper calibration by routine maintenance. 
                  • The city has raw and finished water metering at all sources for water. 
                  • In order to promote water conservation, the city will continue to update local building codes to require all plumbing fixtures and piping in new construction be sized in accordance with the State Plumbing Code and Georgia Water Conservation Law, Code Section 8-2-1 et seq.; the city will continue the current practice of metering all water services and requiring a separate meter for each dwelling unit; and, the city will continue the current practice of utilizing the same uniform unit rate per one thousand (1,000) gallons for all water usage above the monthly minimum. No discount is given for larger water customers. The rate structure is strictly on a "flat" basis. No discount is given for irrigation water meters.

                  Sec. 21-146. - Restriction on outdoor watering of landscape. 
                  Outdoor watering for purposes of planting, growing, managing, or maintaining ground cover, trees, shrubs, or other plants may occur only between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m.; provided, however, that this limitation shall not create any limitation upon the following outdoor water uses: 
                  (1)  Commercial raising, harvesting, or storing of crops; feeding, breeding, or managing livestock or poultry; the commercial production or storing of feed for use in the production of livestock, including, but not limited to, cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits, or for use in the production of poultry, including, but not limited to, chickens, hens, ratites, and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; or the commercial production of aquacultural, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs, and apiarian products or as otherwise defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3; 
                  (2)  Capture and reuse of cooling system condensate or stormwater in compliance with applicable City of LaFayette ordinances and state guidelines;

                  Subdivision, minor: A subdivision of four (4) or fewer lots, which does not involve the construction of a new public or private street. Because minor subdivisions do not involve the construction of a new public or private street, they are processed administratively by the Building Official as final plat applications that do not require preliminary plat approval. Any improvements to an existing public street abutting the tract proposed for minor subdivision, or the installation of utilities along said existing public road, as may be required to comply with this ordinance, shall be done according to plans and permit requirements of this ordinance. 
                  Subdivision, major: The division of a tract or parcel of land into five (5) or more lots which may or may not involve the construction of a new public or private street; or any subdivision that involves the construction of a new public or private street. Because major subdivisions involve construction of a new public or private street or the upgrade of an existing private access way to City standards, construction plans and development permits are required, and major subdivisions are therefore processed in multiple steps including preliminary plat approval (unless specifically exempted), approval of construction plans and issuance of development permits, and final plat approval. 
                  Trail: A way designed for and used by equestrians, pedestrians, and/or cyclists using non-motorized bicycles.

                  Variance: A grant of relief from the strict requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this ordinance; a minimal relaxation or modification of the strict terms of this ordinance as applied to specific property when, because of particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical condition of the property, compliance would result in practical difficulty; or a grant of relief from the strict requirements of this ordinance due to a proposed project not being able to meet policies and objectives specifically identified in the Comprehensive Plan. Variances must be approved by the Board of Appeals. 
                  Vicinity map: A map, not necessarily to scale, showing the general location of the proposed subdivision or land development in relation to major roads, government boundaries, and/or natural features.

When the City of LaFayette receives such a plat, it shall be required that the subdivider or developer submit two copies of the proposed subdivision plat to the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) if such proposed subdivision includes or abuts on any part of the state highway system. The GDOT shall recommend approval and note its recommendation on the copy of the plans to be returned to the City's Building Official or recommend rejection. If the plat is recommended for rejection, the reasons for rejection and requirements for approval shall be indicated in writing. A recommendation for rejection shall be binding on the Building Official and the Planning Commission unless the Planning Commission, by official action recorded in its minutes, overrules the recommendation for rejection. 
                  (7)  Exemptions from Plat Approval. The following types of land subdivisions, transfers, and sales are specifically exempted from the plat approval requirements of this ordinance; provided, however, that such exemptions shall not apply to land development requirements and improvement requirements of this ordinance. 
                  (a)  The creation and sale of cemetery plots. 
                  (b)  The sale of lots consistent with previously approved and recorded plats or deeds. 
                  (c)  The creation of leaseholds for space within a multiple-occupancy building or the division of property into leaseholds for commercial, industrial, or institutional use. 
                  (d)  The creation of leaseholds for the agricultural use of property where the use does not involve the construction of a building to be used as a residence or for other purposes not directly related to agricultural use of the land or crops or livestock raised thereon. 
                  (e)  Any division of land to heirs through a judicial estate proceeding, or any division of land pursuant to a judicial partition, or any division of land occurring from the foreclosure of a deed of trust; provided, however, that such exemption shall not require the City to issue permits if the resulting lots or parcels fail to meet any applicable regulations of the local jurisdiction concerning lot size, lot width, and other dimensional requirements. 
                  (f)  Intra-family land transfers and mortgage lots, as defined by this ordinance. 
                  These exemptions from plat approval do not relieve the landowner from land development requirements established in this ordinance. 
                  (8)  Lot Combinations. An existing lot line forming the boundary between two (2) conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision or a lot line between lots or parcels that have merged to form one (1) building lot may be removed or eliminated through a final plat revision process which conforms to the requirements of this ordinance. In the case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat depicting all lots involved in the lot combination shall be required to be approved by the Building Official and recorded as a final plat. Such combination plat shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision, if applicable, and shall indicate thereon that the replat is for the purpose of removing the lot lines between specific lots. (See Figure). 

                  (9)  Boundary Line Adjustments. One or more existing lot lines forming boundaries between conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision, or one or more lot lines between abutting lots or parcels may be adjusted through a final plat revision process that requires the approval of the Building Official and recording of a plat meeting the specifications of a final plat. In the case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat of the entire lots involved in the boundary line adjustment shall be required to be approved by the Building Official and recorded. Such plat showing said boundary line adjustment shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision and shall include thereon that the replat is for the purpose of adjusting the lot lines between specific lots. (See Figure) 

                  (10)  Design Requirements for Blocks. 
                  1.  Block Length. Intersecting streets shall be provided at such intervals so as to provide adequate cross traffic. Blocks in residential subdivisions should not exceed eighteen hundred (1,800) feet nor be less than six hundred (600) feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from these standards. The Planning Commission may require pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block be located near the center in blocks longer than eight hundred (800) feet. 
                  2.  Block Width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries. (See Figure). 

                  (11)  Design Requirements for Lots. 
                  1.  Natural Features and Assets. In the subdividing of land, appropriate consideration must be given to all natural features, such as tree growth, watercourses, historic sites or similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness to the proposed development and safety from hazards. At the preliminary review meeting the developer must submit an aerial map showing all natural features and assets to discuss developer's plan for development. 
                  2.  Access and Minimum Lot Frontage. Each lot shall have access to a public street and a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet in R-2, R-3 and B-2 zones and ninety (90) feet for R-1 zoning for lots adjacent to public street, flag lots are allowed to have twenty-five (25) feet or more of lot frontage on a public street; provided, however, that the local governing body may permit one or more lots to be accessed by private streets, as more fully specified in this ordinance; provided further, that in the case of a lot accessed by a circular cul-de-sac, the minimum lot frontage may be reduced to thirty (30) feet with a minimum width of seventy-five (75) feet at the setback line. All lot widths except for the flag lot may be given a variance if reviewed and approved according to ordinance. 
                  3.  Adequate Buildable Area Required. Land subject to flooding, improper drainage or erosion, or that is unsuitable for residential or other use for topographical or other reasons, shall not be platted for residential use nor for any other use that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety, or of property destruction, unless the hazards can be and are corrected. Each lot shall contain an adequate building site with positive drainage from the buildable area not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or building setback lines required by the local governing body (See Figure). Considerable evaluation should be given to lots where the drainage either surface or subsurface has a real negative affect. These are usually the last lots sold in the subdivision. 

                  4.  Lot Remnants Not Permitted. All remnants of lots below any required minimum lot size that may be required, left over after subdividing of a larger tract, must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. The Building Official may permit a lot remnant for a specific purpose such as a detention pond, provided that access and design is appropriate and the lot remnant is restricted to specific non-building use. 
                  5.  Service Areas. Commercial and industrial lots shall be adequate to provide service areas and off-street parking suitable to the use intended. 
                  6.  Lot Area. The minimum lot area shall not be less than that established by the zoning regulation in which the subdivision is located, or any other such ordinance provisions, if applicable. 
                  7.  Lot Width. No portion of a lot shall be narrower than that established by the zoning ordinance in which the subdivision exists, with the exception of cul-de-sac lots at the street frontage and flag lots that have a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet. If sewers are not available the health department must establish the lot size requirement if a septic system is allowed. 
                  8.  Lot Depth. Lots shall have a depth of not less than one hundred (100) feet, unless circumstances make these limitations impracticable. 
                  A variance of lot sizes and dimensions may be given during the subdivision approval process, but not for individual lots. Additional approval must be given by the Board of Appeals and City Council. 
                  9.  Flag lots. 
                  (a)  Intent. Flag lots, as defined in this ordinance, are strongly discouraged. However, subdivisions designed with one (1) or more flag lots may be approved where conditions of hardship make standard design or frontage impossible or impractical due to the configuration of the lot to be subdivided. 
                  (b)  Denial if reasonable alternative exists. The Building Official in the case of minor subdivisions and the Planning Commission in the case of other subdivisions shall have due cause to deny any plat that proposes any flag lot, when a reasonable alternative to such lot pattern is available. 
                  (c)  Panhandle (flag pole) length restriction. If permitted, no flag lot shall be allowed to be platted that has a "panhandle" portion (i.e., portion that does not meet the required lot width) that is more than four hundred (400) feet in length. 
                  (d)  Prohibition of abutting flag lots. If permitted, no flag lot shall abut another flag lot in any subdivision. 
                  10.  Side Lot Lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
                  11.  Corner Lots. Corner lots shall have adequate width to meet the front building setback requirements, if applicable, from all rights-of-way. 
                  12.  Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage or "through" lots should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from arterials or overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation. Double frontage lots with frontage on a major arterial street shall have additional depth in order to allow space for screen planting along the lot line abutting a major arterial street. 
                  13.  Mortgage Lot. This provision addresses situations where a bank or other lending institution requires the creation of a small (e.g., 1-acre to 5-acre) tract of property from a larger existing parcel (usually farmland or timber land) in order to provide a mortgage or loan on a home or other principal building, rather than referring to the entire existing lot of record. 
                  (a)  In cases where a person can show the Building Official in writing that an application for loan or mortgage involving real property has been filed with a bank or lending institution, and said bank or lending institution requires, for purposes of the loan or mortgage, a description of property that encompasses less land area than the lot of record, one (1) or two (2) mortgage lots (see definition) may be lawfully created from the parcel of record without constituting a subdivision. Minimum lot sizes established by any land use district or other ordinance requirement of the City shall not be construed to prevent the creation of mortgage lots pursuant to this subsection, even if the resulting mortgage lot created is less than the minimum lot size required by said land use district or other ordinance requirement. The applicant shall be required in the case of a mortgage lot to file with the Building Official a copy of the survey plat creating the mortgage lot, and may be recorded in the records of the Walker County Superior Court Clerk as a mortgage lot plat of record. 
                  (b)  If created, a mortgage lot shall be no less than one (1) acre and no larger than five (5) acres in size. This provision shall not allow for the creation of a mortgage lot from any lot of record that is five (5) acres or less in area. 
                  (c)  No mortgage lot shall be created unless it meets the requirements within this ordinance for creating a lot. 
                  (12)  Easements. Where a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream traverses a subdivision, these conveyances must be maintained by the property owners of property on which they exist unless the City of LaFayette agrees to maintain them and the drainage conveyance has a City approved easement connecting to a public right-of-way giving access to the conveyance. Easements shall be provided for all drainage facilities that are approved and accepted by the City of LaFayette. Where easements are needed for utility locations, the subdivider shall provide them as Utility Easements to the City at a width designated by the City. All easements required pursuant to this section shall be shown on the preliminary plat and recorded on the final plat. All easement areas as designated for a subdivision must be accepted by the City or the area will be maintained by the owner of the property on which the easement exists. 
                  (13)  Survey Monuments for All Lots Required. For all subdivisions, a Georgia registered land surveyor shall install permanent survey monuments at all property corners and land lot lines, prior to final plat approval. Lot corners shall be marked with metal rods not less than one-half (½) inch in diameter and eighteen (18) inches in length and driven so as to be stabilized in the ground. Permanent survey monuments shall also be installed in accordance with the most recent edition of Section 180-7-.05 Monument, of the Rules of State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors and the Georgia Plat Act (O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67). At least four (4) permanent monuments shall have GPS coordinates given for each subdivision plat. 
                  (14)  Preliminary Plat. 
                  1.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure compliance with the basic design concepts and improvement requirements of subdivisions and land developments through the submittal of a preliminary plat of all major and minor subdivisions for review and approval by the Building Official and the City's Planning Commission (major subdivision only unless desired by the Building Official to review minor subdivisions). 
                  2.  Required. All major and minor subdivisions, as defined, shall require the submission of a preliminary plat to the Building Official for review and approval. Review and approval by the Planning Commission (for major subdivisions only). Prior to the issuance of any permit for land disturbance or development, or the installation of any improvements, the Planning Commission must approve the preliminary plat, if required. 
                  3.  Preliminary Plat Application and Specifications. Preliminary plat applications shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 4-1, and preliminary plats shall meet the minimum plat specifications shown in Table 4-2. 
                  4.  Procedures. Upon receipt of a completed preliminary plat application, the Building Official shall schedule the application for the next public meeting before the Planning Commission and forward all pertinent materials in the application to the Planning Commission for review. An application for preliminary plat approval must be submitted as least seven (7) days before the regular meeting date of the Planning Commission to be considered on that agenda. The Planning Commission shall have up to thirty-two (32) days from the date the public meeting is held to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the preliminary plat application. The basis of the Planning Commission's review of and action on a preliminary plat shall be whether the preliminary plat meets the purposes and requirements of this ordinance, and all other ordinances that relate to the proposed development. The Planning Commission will set their next meeting date if necessary to approve the preliminary plat. 
                  5.  Disposition. Approval of a preliminary plat shall be valid for a period of one (1) year, in which time a completed construction plans application must be submitted. If a completed application for construction plans is not submitted during that time, preliminary plat approval shall expire and be null and void. 
                  6.  Amendments to Approved Preliminary Plats. The Building Official is authorized to approve minor amendments to preliminary plats. Any proposed amendment to a preliminary plat that is determined by the Building Official to constitute a public interest shall be deemed a major amendment. For all amendments to preliminary plats determined to be major amendments, Planning Commission approval shall be required. The Planning Commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed major amendment to a preliminary plat. Procedures for considering a major amendment to a preliminary plat shall be the same as required for an initial application for preliminary plat approval. 
                  (15)  Construction Plans and Development Permit. 
                  1.  Application. Upon approval of a preliminary plat and proof of mailing is given to the City that notification has been made to Georgia EPD of land disturbing activity (NOI) and providing the City a copy of the E. and S. Plan (if required), the subdivider or land developer may request a construction plan approval and approval of a development from the City. The construction plan approval and development permitting process is administrative. Applications for construction plan approval and development permit shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2. No application for construction plans shall be accepted for processing nor development permit approved by the Building Official until a preliminary plat has been approved by the Planning Commission (for major subdivisions only) and the proposed construction plans are found by the Building Official to be in substantial conformity with said approval and any conditions of such approval. 
                  2.  Decision Criteria. The only basis upon which the Building Official may deny a construction plan or development permit is the failure of the application to meet the requirements of this ordinance or any other applicable local regulations or the failure of the construction plans and application to meet the requirements of preliminary plat approval specified by the Planning Commission. 
                  3.  Certificate of Approval. All copies of the construction plans shall be noted by inscription on the plan noting such approval by the Building Official. Construction plan approval shall expire and be null and void after a period of one year, unless substantial activity toward improvements on the land has been initiated and said substantial activity is ongoing, or unless the Building Official approves an extension of time. 
                  4.  Engineered Drawings. Engineering drawings for public streets, including cross sections and centerline profiles, and public and private water, sewer, drainage, and utility systems, shall be certified by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. Prior to approval and recording of a final plat, or prior to the approval of any certificate of occupancy, a registered engineer or a registered land surveyor for the subdivider/developer shall submit one (1) copy of all finished, as-built plans of improvements in an approved format, demonstrating that said improvements, as installed, meet the requirements of this ordinance and certifying that the plans accurately reflect actual construction and installation. The Office of the Building Official shall maintain all as-built street and utility plans for future use by the City. 
                  5.  Permits for Construction in Public Right-Of-Way. Permits from the Office of the Building Official shall be required for construction in any public right-of-way. Permits will not be issued until such time that plans have been submitted meeting all the local, state and federal regulations and requirements and the plans must also be reviewed and approved by the Building Official. 
                  6.  Improvements to Abutting Land. For subdivisions and land developments that abut and access an abutting City public street, the subdivider or land developer shall install curb and gutter, sidewalk, other road improvements, and, if required, a deceleration lane, according to standards and specifications of this ordinance and of the City of LaFayette, along all abutting City public streets. When a subdivision or land development uses an unpaved public right-of-way for access, the subdivider or land developer shall improve that right-of-way to a pavement width consistent with City road design standards. Said improvements shall be from the subdivision or land development entrance to the paved City road which the Building Official determines will be the primary direction of travel for residents of the subdivision or occupants of the land development. Said right of way shall be improved by the developer/subdivider to meet all criteria established by the City for street design and construction. 
                  (16)  Final Plat. 
                  1.  When Required. All major subdivisions, resubdivisions, minor subdivisions, and dedications shall require final plat approval. The final plat approval process is administrative. 
                  Applications shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 4-1. 
                  All final plats must have a state licensed surveyor's or engineer's stamp and signature thereon. 
                  Table 4-1  Application Requirements 

                   
                  2.  Criteria for Approval. The Building Official may grant final plat approval if the following conditions, as applicable, are met. 
                  (a)  The Planning Commission has previously approved a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision, if required (not required for minor subdivision). 
                  (b)  Where new improvements are involved in the subdivision, construction plans have been approved by the Building Official, all improvements have been installed and inspected by the Building Official, and subdivision improvement guarantees as required by this ordinance have been submitted. 
                  (c)  The final plat meets all applicable requirements of this ordinance. 
                  (d)  A complete final plat application has been submitted, including all supporting materials required by this ordinance for final plats. 
                  The Building Official shall consider final plats and applications that meet the above-referenced conditions a ministerial action of approval. Denial of a final plat shall be permitted only upon specific findings that one or more of the above-referenced criteria have not been met. 
                  Table 4-2  Plat and Plan Requirements 

                   
                  3.  Approval Certificate. Upon approval of the final plat, a certificate, stamped directly on the plat, shall state: 
                  "Pursuant to the Land Subdivision Regulations of City of LaFayette, Georgia, and all requirements of approval having been fulfilled, this final plat was given preliminary approval by the Planning Commission on ___________, 20___, and final approval by the Building Official and it is entitled to recordation in the Clerk's Office, Walker County Superior Court.

                  4.  Additional Plat Certificates. In addition to information required by Table 4-1 to be supplied on a final plat, each final plat shall contain the following certificates. 
                  Surveyor's Certificate. A certificate by a Georgia Registered Land Surveyor directly on the final plat as follows: 
                  "It is hereby certified that this plat is true and correct and was prepared from an actual survey of the property by me or persons under my supervision; that all monuments shown hereon actually exist or are marked as "future," and that their location, size, type and material are correctly shown; and that all engineering requirements of the Subdivisions and Land Development Ordinance of City of LaFayette, Georgia, have been fully complied with. 
                  By: _____

                  Owner's Certificate. A certificate by the owner directly on the final plat, signed in an appropriate manner as follows: 
                  "The owner of the land shown on this plat and whose name is subscribed hereto, in person or through a duly authorized agent, certifies that this plat was made from an actual survey, and that all State, City and County taxes or other assessments now due on this land have been paid. Said owner donates and dedicates to the public for use forever the public street right-of-ways as shown on this plat. 
                  _____      Owner 
                  Signed, sealed and delivered  in the presence of:  _____ Witness 
                  _____      Notary Public" 
                  Health Department Approval Certificate. 
                  "This final plat has been approved by the Walker County Health Department as being consistent with applicable state and local environmental health requirements. 
                  _____      Director of Walker County Health Department" 
                  [5.]  Distribution of Recorded Final Plat. The final plat is a source of essential information to tax officials, public safety officials, and utility officials, among others. The Owner or Developer shall be responsible for ensuring that each agency listed in this subsection receives a copy of the final recorded plat with assigned addresses: 
                  1.  The County Tax Commissioner 
                  2.  The County Tax Assessor 
                  3.  The County Health Department

                  At the discretion of the Building Official, additional agencies or persons may be added to the above list. 
                  (17)  Dedications of Streets and Public Lands. Public improvements shall be inspected by a City official according to local and state regulations as they are constructed. The Building Official shall inspect all public improvements and shall notify the subdivider or land developer in writing of nonacceptance or preliminary acceptance. If the public improvements are not acceptable, the reason for non-acceptance shall be stated and corrective measures shall be outlined in a letter of notification. Upon notification, the subdivider or land developer shall correct all deficiencies identified in the non-acceptance letter within the time limit established by the Building Official. Once deficiencies are corrected, the subdivider or land developer shall again request inspection in writing. Acceptance of public improvements as required by this ordinance shall be made by the local governing body. As-built drawings of the improvements in acceptable format shall be submitted to the Engineering Department following approval. 
                  Subdivision streets and right-of-ways and other lands to be dedicated to the public shall be accepted or rejected by the City upon formal dedication by the Owner. Upon acceptance a general warranty deed conveying fee simple title of such right-of-ways and lands must be provided by the owner/developer to the City. The warranty deed shall be accompanied by an attorney's certificate of title and a tax transfer form addressed to the Mayor and City Council certifying that the grantor in such deed is vested with marketable fee simple title to the property conveyed thereby, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, and further that the individual executing such deed has full authority to do so. Acceptance of such dedication shall be accomplished by Resolution of the Mayor and City Council. 
                  (18)  Subdivision Improvement Guarantees. In order to protect the City and prospective purchasers of and residents in a subdivision, the subdivider/developer shall provide to the City financial security to guarantee the installation of public improvements including all phases of the project up to and including completion for both Minor and Major Subdivisions having a land size of three (3) acres or more. The subdivider's or developer's financial guarantee may be any of the following: 
                  (a)  An escrow of funds with the City; 
                  (b)  An escrow with a bank or other financial institution upon which the City can draw; 
                  (c)  An irrevocable letter of commitment or credit upon which the City can draw; 
                  (d)  A performance bond for the benefit of the City upon which the City can collect, or a certificate of deposit with assignment letter; and 
                  (e)  Any other form of guarantee approved by the Mayor and City Council that will satisfy the objectives of this section. The guarantee shall be in an amount to secure the full costs, as determined solely by the City, of constructing or installing the improvements and utilities required. 
                  (19)  Limitations on Minor Subdivisions. 
                  1.  Purpose. Minor subdivisions provide certain advantages, such as a shorter application process and less public scrutiny, that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications. Given these advantages, the prospect exists that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via consecutive and/or contiguous minor subdivisions instead of filing for a major subdivision. It is the intent of the Mayor and City Council to prohibit the practice of "chain" subdivisions where the same land owner subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on common contiguous parcels, which collectively total more than four (4) lots. It is also the intent of the Mayor and City Council to prohibit minor subdivisions adjacent to each other within a three-year time period, in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by another person or entity and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the major subdivision process. 
                  2.  Common Contiquous Parcels Shown on Minor Subdivision Plats. Contiguous common parcels, as defined by this ordinance, shall be referenced on all applications for minor subdivisions, and contiguous common parcels shall be considered part of any application for minor subdivision, for purposes of determining whether or not the division of land proposed is a major subdivision or a minor subdivision. Common contiguous parcels shall not be counted as lots in the case of a minor subdivision. 
                  3.  Limitations. Land within a minor subdivision, including all contiguous parcels owned by the subdivider, shall not be further divided for a period of three (3) years unless a preliminary plat application is filed and approved as a major subdivision pursuant to the requirements of this ordinance. If property proposed to be subdivided was part of an original tract, and if the property proposed to be subdivided abuts land that has been divided as a minor subdivision in the last three (3) years, then minor subdivision of said property shall be prohibited. This provision shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two (2) contiguous minor subdivisions under separate ownership; however, this provision is intended to be construed so that one property owner does not develop a minor subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or sell another part of the original tract for the purposes of minor subdivision within a three-year period. It is the intent that land abutting a minor subdivision that was owned by the subdivider of the abutting minor subdivision shall not be subdivided as a minor subdivision for a period of three (3) years, regardless of ownership. 
                  (20)  Standards for Configuring New Streets. 
                  1.  Purpose and Intent. The entire community enjoys the benefits of an interconnected network of streets and roads. It is the intention of the City that new street alignments in new developments reflect the traditional style exhibited throughout older, established neighborhoods. Interconnected streets afford easier, safer access for emergency vehicles, school buses, and sanitation trucks while distributing traffic more evenly and avoiding excess traffic on certain central residential streets. Street patterns that result in isolated pockets of development with relatively little interconnectivity are strongly discouraged. Wherever cul-de-sacs or hammerhead turnarounds are unavoidable (typically for topographic reasons) they must always be provided with bicycle or pedestrian linkages to other nearby streets or to a neighborhood trail system. Wherever possible, cul-de-sacs should be designed to include a central island preserving existing greenery or, alternatively, planted with approved trees, shrubs, and plants. 
                  2.  Street Alignment, Intersections and Jogs. Streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles (ninety (90) degrees), but in no case shall such a street intersection be less than seventy-five (75) degrees. Where street offsets or jogs cannot be avoided, offset "T" intersections shall be separated by a minimum centerline offset of one hundred fifty (150) feet in urban areas and three hundred (300) feet in rural areas. (See Figure). 

                  3.  Continuation of Existing Streets and Connections. Existing streets, and their rights-of-way, shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width. The Planning Commission may require that a major subdivision provide one or more future connections to adjoining subdivisions or unsubdivided tracts. 
                  4.  Street Plans for Future Phases of the Tract. Where the plat or site plan proposed to be subdivided or developed includes only part of the tract owned or intended for subdivision or development by the subdivider or land developer, a tentative plan of a future street system for the portion not slated for immediate subdivision consideration shall be required by the Building Official and shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider or land developer. 
                  5.  Dead-End Streets and Cul-De-Sacs. Streets that dead-end shall terminate in a cul-de-sac. The maximum length of such streets shall be six hundred (600) feet in urban areas and twelve hundred (1,200) feet in rural areas. Streets that are planned to continue at some future date shall provide a temporary cul-de-sac as required by the Building Official. 
                  6.  Marginal Access Streets. Whenever a major subdivision is proposed abutting the right-of-way of a U.S. or State highway, a marginal access street approximately parallel and adjacent to such right-of-way may be required by the Planning Commission at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between such marginal access street and highway right-of-way. The Planning Commission may also require a twenty-foot no-access easement and planting strip along the major arterial street to ensure that lots fronting on said street do not have access thereto. (See Figure). 

                  7.  Alleys and Service Access. Alleys may be provided. If they are provided, they must at least be graveled. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible; but if unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities. Service access shall be provided to commercial and industrial developments for off-street loading, unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. 
                  (21)  Requirements for Streets. 
                  1.  Bridges. Bridges on public rights-of-way shall meet current American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials standards. 
                  2.  Grading and Stabilization of street Rights-of-Ways. When a new public street is proposed, all trees, brush, stumps, rocks, or other debris shall be cleared from the street right-of-way, except in cases where trees are required to be preserved by the Building Official. All streets shall be graded to lines, grades and cross sections approved on plans. All unsurfaced, disturbed portions of street rights-of-way shall be stabilized by seeding, fertilizing, and mulching or by another equally effective method. 
                  3.  Radius at Street Intersections. The right-of-way radius at street intersections shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet, with larger radii for streets serving nonresidential development, as approved by the Building Official. The minimum pavement (curb) radius at street intersections shall be twenty-five (25) feet. 
                  4.  Street Grades. No street grade shall be less than one percent. No street grade for an arterial or collector street shall exceed eight (8) percent. No other local street grade shall exceed twelve (12) percent, unless the Building Official finds that due to topographic conditions, a steeper grade is necessary, in which case the street grade shall not exceed fifteen (15) percent. Grades between twelve (12) percent and fifteen (15) percent shall not exceed a length of one hundred fifty (150) feet. 
                  5.  Minimum Street Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths. Street right-of-way and pavement widths shall at minimum meet the following: 

                   

                  Residential Street with Curb and Gutter  (Cross Section Detail) 

                    

                  Cul-de-Sac Detail 
                  6.  Street Horizontal Alignment and Reverse Curves. Street horizontal alignments and reverse curves shall at minimum meet the following: 

                   
                  (22)  Curb Cuts and Access Specifications. 
                  1.  Entrance Improvement Specifications. Roadway entrances and improvements, including necessary acceleration and/or deceleration lane(s) and right/left turn lanes, shall be designed, installed, and maintained as approved by the State Department of Transportation, as applicable, or the Building Official, in accordance with applicable State or City specifications. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any state highway shall be approved by the State Department of Transportation and the Building Official prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any land use permit or building permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any City street shall be approved by the Building Official prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any land use permit or building permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits. 
                  2.  Curb Cut Specifications. No curb cut or access driveway shall be permitted to be located closer than fifty (50) feet to the nearest existing or proposed right-of-way of an intersecting roadway. Curb cuts or access driveways shall be no narrower than twenty (20) feet from back of curb to back of curb. Strict adherence to these requirements may not be practical in all instances as determined by the Building Official. The Building Official may limit the maximum width of a curb cut and/or the number of curb cuts to a parcel as necessary when it is deemed to be of benefit to the safety and welfare of the public. 
                  The following factors may be considered during the review and approval of a specific location of an entrance: the location of existing or planned median breaks; separation requirements between the entrance and major intersections; separation requirements between other entrances; the need to provide shared access with other sites; the need to align with previously approved or constructed access points on the opposite side of the street; and the minimum number of entrances needed to move traffic onto and off the site safely and efficiently. 
                  3.  Access Along and Near Divided Highways. Where a divided highway exists or is planned, the following access standards shall be met: Minimum separation of intersecting roads and driveways shall be determined during the review of the proposed plan. Part of the determining factor will be the traffic congestion that is being created. 
                  4.  Interparcel Connections. New development that contains or is intended to contain more than one (1) building or use on site shall provide connections so that automobile trips between and among such buildings or uses can be accomplished without using the highway or major street. Where possible and practical, new developments and substantial improvements to existing developments shall provide for pedestrian and automobile access connections between adjacent properties under different ownership when the uses of the properties are of such compatibility that patrons may frequent both buildings or uses in the same vehicle trip. 
                  (23)  Street Lighting. Street lights may be provided in accordance with City specifications by the developers of a subdivision prior to the approval of a final plat. Fixtures and standards/poles installed or used shall be approved by the City and by the utility company that will be responsible for the maintenance of the facilities. The fixtures shall be mounted no more than thirty (30) feet above the ground and shall have appropriate arm length or power to place light over the street. Post top luminaries may be permitted when approved by the Public Works Director. Fixtures shall be located no more than five hundred (500) feet apart, unless approved by the Public Works Director, and, when provided, at least one (1) light shall be located at each public or private street intersection within the subdivision or land development. 
                  The developer shall pay all costs for poles, fixtures and any other related items or materials necessary for the installation of street lights. All electric utilities will be installed and approved by the Electrical Department and will be accepted as part of the City's electrical system upon completion. Maintenance and operation costs of street lights will be assumed by the City no earlier than one year after lights have been installed. 
                  (24)  Street Signs. Signs for street names, directions of travel, traffic control, and hazards shall be provided as directed by the Public Works Department. Street signs on exterior/boundary streets shall be installed by the City with the developer paying a proportionate share determined by the City. Street signs for interior streets of a subdivision or land development shall be installed at the subdivider or developer's expense by the subdivider or developer, subject to the approval of the Public Works Department. 
                  Unless otherwise provided in standards and specifications adopted by the City, street signs shall meet the following specifications as hereinafter set forth. Signs shall be constructed of aluminum sheets with reflective backgrounds. Information on the street name signs shall be readable from both sides of the sign. Signs shall be installed on a steel post. The vertical distance from the road elevation to the bottom of the sign face shall be seven (7) feet with a minimum burial depth of three (3) feet. 
                  (25)  Curbs and Gutters. Curbs and gutters shall be installed if required by the Public Works Department in accordance with standards and specifications of the City. All residential, commercial and industrial subdivisions and land developments must have curbs and gutters, regardless of the size of the lots. When property fronting on an existing City street is subdivided or developed, and the subdivision or land development uses said existing street for access, then curb and gutter shall be required along said street along the entire property frontage of said street. Extruded concrete and asphalt curbs may be allowed if approved during the review process. 
                  Curbs shall be concrete which shall be class A 3000 psi strength at twenty-eight (28) days. The typical curb minimum section shall be six (6) inches by twenty-four (24) inches by twelve (12) inches (see Figure). 

                  Vertical Curb Detail 
                  All streets and roads not required to include curbs and gutters shall be graded, paved, and drained to meet all construction and drainage standards for ditches, slopes, and grassing according to specifications established by the City. 
                  (26)  Sidewalks. 
                  1.  When Required. Sidewalks shall be provided in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan, unless the Building Official determines that no public need exists for sidewalks in a certain location. Sidewalks shall be required when land developments and subdivisions are located within one-mile of a public school. Sidewalks are required to be installed along one side of the street internal to a major subdivision and in minor subdivisions when adjacent areas have sidewalks, except in cases where the median lot size of the major subdivision is two (2) acres or more. 
                  2.  Location. Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated nonpayment right-of-way of roads and shall parallel the street pavement as much as possible; provided, however, the Building Official may permit sidewalks to be designed and constructed so that they meander around permanent obstructions or deviate from a linear pattern for design purposes. 
                  3.  Specifications. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four (4) feet wide. A median strip of grassed or landscaped areas at least two (2) feet wide (could vary as per building official) shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs in residential areas. 
                  (27)  Private Streets. 
                  1.  Private Streets are NOT Permitted. 
                  2.  Construction Plans Required. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to construct a new private street or alter an existing private street or to cause the same to be done without first obtaining approval of construction plans from the Building Official and a development permit issued in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  (28)  Drainage and Stormwater Management. 
                  1.  General Requirements. An adequate drainage system, separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system and including any necessary ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water for all subdivisions and land developments. Sizing and location of all drainage structures shall be the responsibility of a registered professional engineer or land surveyor. The City shall require the use of on-site control methods such as retention or detention to mitigate the stormwater and drainage impacts of the proposed subdivisions and land developments. The Planning Commission shall not approve any preliminary plat of subdivision that does not make adequate provision for storm and flood water runoff channels or basins as determined by the Building Official. No building permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or development permit issued for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate system of drainage and storm water management that meets all federal, state and local requirements. 
                  2.  Method of Design and Capacity. Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed by the Rational Method, or other methods as approved by the City, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with required plans. Drainage improvements shall accommodate potential runoff from the entire upstream drainage area within the site and shall be designed to prevent increases in downstream flooding. Capacity for a ten-year storm or rain shall be provided for all street drainage structures such as catch basin, inlets cross drains, etc. Capacity for a one hundred-year frequency storm event shall be provided for all main drainage structures such as retention basins, principal storm sewers, and all types of flood protection works. 
                  3.  Location. Drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, and shall be constructed in accordance with standards and specifications of the City. Catch basins shall be located at low points of streets. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual, unobstructed easements at least fifteen (15) feet in width for drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road right-of-way and with satisfactory access to the road. 
                  4.  Discharge. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot or land development site to adjacent lots, land development sites, or vacant properties. Storm water shall not be discharged directly to perennial streams. It shall be directed toward natural drainages. If water must be discharged to a stream, the water quality flowing into the stream must meet or exceed the water quality in the receiving waters. The water quantity flowing into the stream must be evaluated to ensure the stream channel can accommodate the increased flows and not disrupt or degrade the ecology of the water body. 
                  5.  Grading and Site Drainage. Lots or land development sites shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and drainage for individual lots or land development sites shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Buildings and parking lots shall be appropriately drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties or public streets. All disturbed or graded ground areas of a building site not used for buildings or open storage areas shall be appropriately stabilized and grassed or covered with plants or landscaping materials. 
                  6.  Cross-Drainpipes. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure, the design of which shall be approved by the City. Cross-drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural waterflow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit full-width roadways and the required slopes. Cross drainpipes shall have head walls of an approved type on inlet and outlet ends of the pipe. Pipe installed within the right-of-way shall be reinforced concrete pipe. All storm drainpipes shall be minimum eighteen (18) inches in diameter. Storm sewer slopes shall be equal to or greater than one (1) percent. 
                  7.  Drop Inlets. Drop inlets shall be generally three-foot by three-foot boxes with two-foot by three-foot grates unless otherwise specified by the City. 
                  8.  Easements. Where an irrigation ditch or channel, natural creek, stream or other drainage way crosses a subdivision or land development, the subdivider or developer shall provide an easement sufficient for drainage and maintenance. Easements shall be provided for all drainage facilities as approved by the City. When a subdivision or land development is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or intermittent stream, a stormwater or drainage easement of at least twenty (20) feet shall be provided. 
                  (29)  Water. 
                  1.  Generally. All habitable buildings and buildable lots shall be connected to a water system capable of providing water for health and emergency purposes, including adequate fire protection. The determination of whether the City's existing water system is adequate to serve any new construction shall be made by the City's Water Department and their Engineering Consultant. Providing water for any development must be done while continuing to meet state requirements for the rest of the water system that is affected. No permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate water supply. 
                  2.  Water Main Requirements. When a public water main is accessible, the developer shall install adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, according to City specifications and as approved by the City and the State of Georgia. All water mains shall normally be at least six (6) inches in diameter except that pipe of lesser size may be used if properly looped and adequate water pressure is maintained in accordance with standards established by the Southeastern Fire Underwriters Association. Pipe of less than four (4) inches shall not be used except in unusual cases. Water lines shall be installed at least thirty (30) inches below grade where practical. Water mains within subdivisions and land developments must be provided with connections to each lot in the subdivision or land development, except as otherwise specifically provided. 
                  3.  Wells. Private wells are not allowed as a potable water source within the City of LaFayette. 
                  4.  Community Water System. Community water systems are not allowed within the City of LaFayette. 
                  5.  Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all nonresidential land developments and all subdivisions within the city limits of LaFayette. Fire hydrants with appropriate water pressure at appropriate intervals throughout the subdivision or land development shall be provided by the subdivider or land developer as required by the City Fire Department. Fire hydrants shall be located no more than one thousand (1,000) feet apart and within five hundred (500) feet of any principal dwelling. Hydrants, fittings, valves and fire department connections shall be approved by the LaFayette Fire Department. Fire department connections shall be not less than eighteen (18) inches or more than thirty-six (36) inches above the level of the adjoining ground or paving. The thread of such connections shall be uniform with that used by the Fire Department. To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves, and all other supply improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a street within the right-of-way shared by such underground utilities. 
                  (30)  Sewer. 
                  1.  Generally. All habitable buildings and buildable lots shall be served by an approved means of wastewater collection and treatment. Each subdivision and land development shall be served by adequate sewage disposal facilities. No permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate system of wastewater collection and treatment. 
                  2.  Connection to Public Sewerage System. All developments within the City limits must connect to the City sewerage system. Any development outside the City limits wanting to connect to our sewer system must at their request be annexed into the City. The subdivider or land developer shall extend the City sewers within his development and provide sewers accessible to each lot in the subdivision or to each land development. With the accessability of public sanitary sewer, it shall be unlawful for any person to maintain upon any such property an individual sewage disposal system. Sanitary sewers shall be located within street or alley rights-of-way unless topography dictates otherwise. No public sewer shall be less than eight inches in diameter. Manholes shall be installed in sanitary sewers with a maximum distance between two (2) manholes of four hundred (400) feet, unless otherwise specified by standards of the City. Sanitary sewer slopes shall be equal to or greater than 0.7 percent for eight-inch lines. All sewer lines shall be designed with slopes to obtain a minimum velocity of two (2) feet per second. Minimum twenty-foot wide easements shall be provided for all sanitary sewer lines. 
                  (31)  Utilities. All utility facilities, including but not limited to gas, electric power, telephone, and cable television, shall be located underground throughout the subdivision or land development. Whenever existing utility facilities (other than major distribution lines) are located above ground, except when existing with public roads rights-of-ways, they shall be removed and placed underground. All utilities shall be placed within street right of ways if possible. Utilities may be installed along lot lines if necessary, but must be within designated "Utility" easements being at least fifteen (15) feet in width. These easements must be recorded as part of the final plat. 
                  (32)  Oversizing of Improvements and Utilities. The subdivider or land developer shall construct such oversized improvements and utilities that the City determines are necessary, provided that the subdivider or land developer shall not be obligated for the additional cost of improvements and utilities that are not uniquely required for that development, and provided the subdivider agrees to a proposal by the City to share in the cost arrangements for over-sizing improvements and utilities. A formula may be developed by the City to provide for a sharing of the cost of other improvements needed to serve the subdivision or land development when certain of the improvements are necessary to serve future subdivisions or developments in the vicinity. 
                  (33)  Administration. 
                  1.  Fees. The fees for various applications required by this Ordinance are listed below. These Fees are established at a level that fully or at least partially offset the costs of administration. 

                   
                  2.  Additional Specifications. The Building Official is hereby authorized to prepare and recommend standard drawings and constructions specifications for private and public improvements not specified in this ordinance. Upon their adoption by the local governing body, they shall become mandatory. 
                  3.  Variances. Upon application, a variance to the terms of this ordinance may be granted, subject to the requirements of Zoning Article VIII. 
                  4.  Inspections. The Building Official shall be authorized to inspect premises proposed for subdivision or land development, including any improvements within such subdivision or land development, to determine compliance with the requirements of this ordinance and other laws and regulations of City. No person shall refuse entry or access to any person authorized to conduct inspections who presents appropriate credentials for same, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such person while in the process of carrying out his official duties. The Building Official is authorized to establish procedures for inspection of land development activity at various intervals in the development process, including without limitation inspection procedures for erosion control, the initiating of grading or land-disturbing activity, installation of on-site sewage disposal systems or sanitary sewer, installation of storm drainage pipe, detention, or other storm water facilities, and installation of street curbing and gutter, road sub-grade, base, or paving. 
                  5.  Enforcement, Violations, Remedies, and Penalties. Enforcement, violations, remedies and penalties shall be as specified in Zoning Article VII. 
                  6.  Amendment. The Mayor and City Council may amend this ordinance in a manner consistent with Georgia law. Before enacting such amendment to this ordinance, the Planning Commission shall provide a recommendation on the proposed amendment. The Mayor and City Council shall hold a public hearing thereon, notice of which shall be published at least fifteen (15) days prior to such hearing in the city's legal organ or a newspaper of general circulation in the county. 
                  (34)  Repealer. All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict with this section are hereby repealed.

                  ARTICLE IV. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Section 29-40. - Nonconforming uses. 
                  The lawful use of any building or structure or land existing at the time of the enactment of or subsequent amendment to this Chapter may be continued subject to the restrictions contained in this Chapter even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this Chapter except that the nonconforming structure or use shall not be: 
                  (1)  Changed to another nonconforming use; 
                  (2)  Torn down and rebuilt as a nonconforming use; 
                  (3)  Extended or enlarged except in conformity with this Chapter; 
                  (4)  Reestablished after vacancy or discontinuance of use continually for one year, whether or not such vacancy or discontinuance commenced prior to the enactment of this Chapter; 
                  (5)  Rebuilt, altered, or repaired, except in conformity with this Chapter, after damage exceeding 50 percent of the fair market value of the improvement as determined from the tax records of the City of LaFayette; provided, however, this provision (5) shall not apply to owner-occupied dwellings. 
                  Section 29-41. - Discontinuance of nonconforming uses. 
                  All nonconforming uses of land shall be discontinued or made to conform with the use provisions of this Chapter within the following periods of time from the date of adoption of this Chapter or subsequent amendments effecting the nonconforming use: 
                  (1)  Nonconforming outdoor advertising signs and automobile junkyards—two years; 
                  (2)  A nonconforming use of land involving no buildings other than accessory buildings—two years. 
                  Section 29-42. - Offstreet parking and storage. 
                  (1)  Offstreet parking required. Offstreet vehicular parking spaces shall be provided on every lot on which any building, structure, or use is hereafter established in all use districts, except as otherwise specifically exempted by this chapter. Required parking spaces shall be available for the parking of operable passenger vehicles for residents, customers, patrons, and employees, as appropriate given the subject use. 
                  (2)  Location of offstreet parking areas. All parking spaces required by this article shall be provided on the same lot with the main building or use that it serves. Upon demonstration that the parking spaces required are not available and cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot as the building, structure or use it serves, the building official may permit the required parking spaces to be provided on any lot, of which a substantial portion is within five hundred (500) feet of such building, structure, or use. This provision shall require submittal of evidence of ownership or valid agreement to lease the parking area offsite that is intended to be used to comply with this section. 
                  (3)  Parking plan required. Before any building or land use permit is issued, the proposed parking lot layout and area must be found by the building official to be in compliance with all requirements of this chapter. A parking plan, for all but detached single-family uses, shall be submitted for approval by the building official. Occupancy of the land or use of a building shall not occur until the building official determines that parking facilities are available in accordance with the approved plan. 
                  (4)  Minimum number of parking spaces required. On each lot where a building, structure, or use exists, offstreet parking shall be provided according to Table 3. No existing facility used for offstreet parking shall be reduced in capacity to less than the minimum required number of spaces, or altered in design or function to less than the minimum standards. 
                  Table 3  Minimum Number of Offstreet Parking Spaces Required 

                   
                  (5)  Interpretations of parking requirements. Where a fractional space results during the calculation of required parking, the required number of parking spaces shall be construed to be the next highest whole number. Where the parking requirement for a particular use is not described in this article, and where no similar use is listed, the building official shall determine the number of spaces to be provided based on requirements for similar uses, location of the proposed use, the number of employees on the largest shift, the total square footage, potential customer use, and other expected demand and traffic generated by the proposed use. 
                  (6)  Reduction of required parking for mixed or joint use of parking spaces. When more than one (1) use is provided on a lot, and such uses operate more or less simultaneously, the total requirements for offstreet parking spaces shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately. The building official may authorize a reduction in the total number of required offstreet parking spaces for two (2) or more uses jointly providing parking facilities when their respective hours of need of maximum parking do not normally overlap, provided that the developer submits sufficient data to demonstrate that the hours of maximum demand for parking at the respective uses do not normally overlap. The required spaces assigned to one (1) use may not be assigned to another use at the same time, except that one-half (½) of the parking spaces required for churches, theaters or assembly halls whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which will be closed at night or on Sundays. 
                  (Ord. No. 03-12, § 1, 10-13-2003; Ord. No. 08-12, § 1, 10-13-2008) 
                  Section 29-43. - Loading. 
                  (1)  Offstreet loading areas required for specified uses. On the same lot with every building, structure or part thereof, erected or occupied for manufacturing, storage, warehouse, truck freight terminal, department store, wholesale store, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary, dry cleaning plant, retail business, or other uses similarly involving the receipt or distribution of vehicles, materials or merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained adequate space for the standing, loading and unloading of such materials to avoid undue interference with public use of streets, alleys, and parking areas. 
                  (2)  Loading area specifications. Unless otherwise approved by the building official, loading and unloading spaces shall be a minimum of fourteen (14) feet wide, forty (40) feet long, with fourteen (14) feet of height clearance. Said loading area shall be located to the rear of the building unless site design precludes a rear location, in which case loading will be to the side of a building. 
                  (3)  Minimum number of offstreet loading/unloading spaces required. One (1) offstreet loading/unloading space shall be provided for the first ten thousand (10,000) square feet of gross floor area or fractional part thereof for light industrial use and one (1) offstreet loading/unloading space for the first five thousand (5,000) square feet of gross floor area or fractional part thereof for retail or other nonindustrial use for which a loading/unloading space is required. One (1) additional space shall be required for each additional twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet of gross floor area or fractional part hereof for light industrial use and for each additional ten thousand (10,000) square feet of gross floor area or fractional part thereof for retail or other nonindustrial use. 
                  (Ord. No. 08-12, § 1, 10-13-2008) 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 08-12, adopted Oct. 13, 2008 changed the title of § 29-43 from offstreet loading and unloading spaces to loading. 
                  Section 29-44. - Space requirements. 
                  (1)  Retail Business: one space 10 feet by 25 feet for each 3,000 square feet of floor area, or part thereof. 
                  (2)  Wholesale and Industrial: one space 10 feet by 50 feet for each 10,000 square feet of floor area, or part thereof. 
                  Section 29-45. - Required buffers. 
                  An adequate buffer strip consisting of a durable masonry wall, fence or hedge, or other natural planting of comparable opacity shall be required between commercial, industrial, R-3 residential uses, and R-2 or R-1 residential uses. Such buffers shall be constructed and maintained by the owner of the industrial, commercial or R-3 residential property. The buffers shall be designed to be compatible with the residential character of adjoining properties, and shall be provided along the side and/or rear lines of any lot zoned or used for commercial, industrial, and R-3 residential purposes. If a durable masonry wall or fence is used, it shall be 6 feet in height along the side and/or rear yards of the adjoining lot zones or used for residential 1 or 2 [R-1 or R-2] purposes. A masonry wall, ventilated redwood or rough sewn cedar fence would be appropriate screen materials. 
                  If a hedge or other natural planting of comparable opacity is used, it shall consist of [a] planted strip at least 10 feet in width and containing a mixture of deciduous and evergreen trees spaced in a staggered triangular pattern not more than 10 feet apart and containing not less than 2 rows of dense plant materials. The same shall be planted at an initial height of at least 4 feet and shall be of such variety that an average height of 8 feet can be expected by normal growth within 4 years from the time of initial planting. All plant materials shall be planted at least 3 feet from the side or rear lot line of the adjoining lot in a residential 1 or 2 [R-1 or R-2] zone. 
                  It is the further intent of this section to promote an overall homogeneity within the buffer strip. Therefore, where a type of buffer is agreed upon whether it be fence, wall or planting this type shall be continued by adjacent property owners along the block or property between two parallel streets. A cross street will be deemed an adequate point for change of materials in a buffer strip. 
                  Section 29-46. - Inspection and maintenance of required buffers. 
                  The durable masonry wall or fence and/or the plant materials required by this Chapter will be subject to periodic inspections by the building inspector who shall determine that the property owner and/or occupant of the premises has maintained the buffer strip in neat order. The plant material shall be periodically trimmed or pruned at a height not less than 6 feet and diseased or dead plant materials shall be removed and replaced. Failure to maintain the buffer zone in an acceptable standard shall be deemed a violation of this Chapter. 
                  Section 29-47. - Fences and walls.

                  1.  Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the Director. 
                  2.  Regulatory compliance. 
                  a.  All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 
                  b.  Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  3.  Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. 
                  4.  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the Director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  5.  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunication facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this ordinance are met. 
                  6.  Visual impact. 
                  a.  Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background. 
                  c.  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. 
                  d.  Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the Governing Body or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  e.  Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
                  7.  Landscaping. 
                  a.  Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property. 
                  b.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  c.  The Board of Appeals may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the Board of Appeals. 
                  8.  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street. 
                  9.  Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
                  a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicles storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility. 
                  b.  Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 
                  10.  Lot size and setbacks. 
                  a.  The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities, provided however, that the Board of Appeals may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby. 
                  i.  Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure. 
                  ii.  Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
                  iii.  Telecommunications facilities must be setback from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in Section V. 
                  b.  For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten foot (10') high antenna and supporting structure requires ten foot (10') setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact. 
                  B.  Additional requirements for towers: 
                  1.  Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. 
                  2.  Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 
                  3.  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment.

                  4.  [ Additional information: ] The applicant must provide any other information which may be requested by the Planning Commission or the Board of Appeals to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact a proposed telecommunications facility. 
                  B.  Conditional use permits. In granting a conditional use permit, the Board of Appeals may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties. 
                  VI.  Future co-location. Applicant and owner shall allow other future personal wireless service companies, including public and quasi-public agencies, using functionally equivalent personal wireless technology to co-locate antennae, equipment and facilities on a telecommunications facility unless specific technical constraints prohibit said co-location. Applicant and other personal wireless carriers shall provide a mechanism for the construction and maintenance of shared facilities and infrastructure and shall provide for equitable sharing cost in accordance with industry standards. 
                  VII.  Nuisances. Telecommunications facilities, including, without limitation, power source, ventilation and cooling, shall be operated at all times within the limits of the City of LaFayette Noises Ordinance, shall not be operated so as to cause the generation of heat that adversely affects a building occupant and shall not be maintained or operated in such a manner as to be nuisance. 
                  VIII.  Removal of antennae and towers. All telecommunications facilities shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such facilities. If upon inspection by the Director any such telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owners shall have thirty (30) days to bring such facility into compliance. In the event such telecommunications facility is not brought into compliance within (30) days the City may provide notice to the owners requiring the telecommunications facility to be removed. In the event such telecommunications facility is not removed within (30) days of receipt of such notice, the City may remove such facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the City in taking action shall not in any way waive the City's right to take action. The City may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The City may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.

If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice from the City notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the City may remove such tower and/or antennae and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The City may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the City in taking action shall not in any way waive the City's right to take action. The City may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The City may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  B.  If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this ordinance as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna. 
                  X.  Preexisting towers/nonconforming uses. 
                  A.  All telecommunications facilities operative on February 8, 1999, shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a nonconforming use and shall be treated as a nonconforming use in accordance with Section 18-20.1 of the Municipal Code. Routine maintenance, including replacement with a new tower or antenna of like construction and height, shall be permitted on such existing telecommunications facilities. New construction other than routine maintenance shall comply with requirements of this ordinance. 
                  B.  A telecommunications facility that has received City approval as of February 8, 1999, in form of either a building permit or conditional use exception, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation shall be considered an existing telecommunications facility so long as such approval is current and not expired. 
                  C.  Placement of an antenna on a nonconforming structure shall not be considered an expansion of the nonconforming structure. 
                  XI.  Penalty for violation of ordinance. 
                  A.  Any person who attempts to erect or erects a telecommunications facility covered by this ordinance without having first obtained the necessary building permit, conditional use permit or variance in the manner provided in this ordinance shall be guilty of violating a duly adopted ordinance of the city and shall be punished either by a fine not to exceed $500.00 or by imprisonment not to exceed 60 days or both. The court shall have the power and authority to place any person guilty of violation of this ordinance on probation and to suspend or modify any fine or sentence. As a condition of such suspension, the court may require payment of restitution or impose other punishment allowed by law. 
                  B.  If any structure is erected, constructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained in violation of this ordinance or without obtaining that required permits, or if any building, structure or land is used in violation of this article, the City, in addition to any other remedies, may institute proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use or to correct or abate such violations. Each and every day such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use continues may be deemed a separate offense. 
                  XII.  Coordination with federal law. Whenever the Governing Authority finds that the application of this ordinance would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services or prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, a conditional use permit waiving any or all of the provisions of this ordinance may be granted.

                  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Building Inspector certifies to the Board of Appeals after the notice shall have been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate of stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril of life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Building Inspector and on due cause shown. 
                  Section 29-84. - Powers and duties.

                  Administrative Review. 
                  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirements, decision or determination made by the Building Inspector in the enforcement of this Chapter. 
                  Conditional Uses. 
                  To hear and decide only such conditional uses as the Board of Appeals is specifically authorized to pass on by Article VI of this Chapter; to decide such questions as are involved in determining whether conditional uses should be granted; and to grant conditional uses with such conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this Chapter; or to deny conditional uses when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this Chapter. 
                  A conditional use shall not be granted by the Board of Appeals unless and until: 
                  a.  A written application for a conditional use is submitted indicating the section of this Chapter under which the conditional use is sought and stating the ground on which it is requested. 
                  b.  Appropriate notice is given by mail to the owner of the property for which conditional use is sought or his attorney. 
                  c.  The proposed use has been reviewed by the Planning Commission. 
                  d.  The Board of Appeals shall make a finding that it is empowered under the section of this Chapter described in the application to grant the conditional use and that the granting of the conditional use will not adversely affect the public interest. 
                  When acting upon such application for a conditional use, the Board of Appeals shall give consideration to the following factors, where applicable: 
                  a.  The proposed design and location of the particular development. 
                  b.  The possible traffic-generating characteristics of the proposed development. 
                  c.  The effects the proposed development will have on the present or intended character of the area in which it proposes to locate. 
                  d.  The availability of public utilities, facilities and services. 
                  In granting the conditional use, the Board of Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Chapter and punishable under Article VII of this Chapter. 
                  Variances. 
                  To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this Chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the Chapter will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this Chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. A variance from the terms of this Chapter shall not be granted by the Board of Appeals unless and until: 
                  a.  A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating that: 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; 
                  (2)  The application of the Chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  (3)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular land, building, or structure involved, and not applicable to any other existing situation in the same District; 
                  (4)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this Chapter, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this Chapter; 
                  (5)  A literal interpretation of this Chapter would deprive the applicant of any right that others in the same District are allowed; 
                  (6)  The special circumstances are not a result of the action of the applicant; 
                  (7)  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Chapter to other lands, structures, or buildings in this District; 
                  (8)  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure. 
                  b.  The Board shall make findings that the requirements set forth in this section have been met; that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance; and that the granting of such variance is in harmony with the spirit of this Chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood. 
                  Section 29-85. - Decisions of the board of appeals. 
                  In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board may, in conformity with the provisions of this Chapter, reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the Building Inspector.

                  Section 29-90. - Authority. 
                  The City Council may from time to time on its own motion or on petition, after public notice and hearing as provided by law, amend, supplement, or change, modify, or repeal the boundaries or regulations herein or subsequently established, after submitting the same to the City Planning Commission for its recommendations and report. 
                  The City Council in exercising its zoning power and the City Planning Commission in investigating and making a recommendation to a zoning proposal shall consider the following standards, to wit: 
                  (1)  Whether the zoning proposal will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property; 
                  (2)  Whether the zoning proposal will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property; 
                  (3)  Whether the property to be affected by the zoning proposal has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned; 
                  (4)  Whether the zoning proposal will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities or schools; 
                  (5)  Whether there are existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal; 
                  (6)  Existing uses and zoning of nearby property; 
                  (7)  Extent to which property values are diminished, if any, by the existing zoning; 
                  (8)  The suitability of the property involved in the zoning proposal for the currently zoned purposes; 
                  (9)  If vacant, the length of time the property has been vacant as currently zoned, considered in the context of land development of adjacent and nearby property; and 
                  (10)  Any special characteristics of the property involved in the zoning proposal. 
                  In addition to the above standards, the City Council may consider other criteria and factors which it finds relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality or general welfare against the right of the unrestricted use of property.

                  ARTICLE XI. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS[4] 

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (4) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 00-10, § 1, adopted July 10, 2000, set out provisions for use as § 18-22,7 of the zoning ordinance. To preserve the numbering of the zoning ordinance of this Code, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as Art. XI, §§ 29-121—29-153. 

                  Section 29-121. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult entertainment establishments, these provisions represent a balancing of competing interests; reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
                  (b)  Findings. Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, City of Carrollton, City of LaGrange, City of Dalton, City of Rome, Whitfield County, Richmond County, DeKalb County, Fulton County, and City of Augusta, which experience, we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the City of LaFayette, Georgia, the mayor and council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our state. Moreover, it is the findings of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity is disorderly conduct, assault, batteries, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity is depression of the surrounding property and the absence of new businesses coming into the area surrounding the establishments, and a deterioration in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which allow and/or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, these provisions are adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted. These provisions are designed to combat undesirable secondary effects, to combat a decline in surrounding property, and to combat an increase in crime.
