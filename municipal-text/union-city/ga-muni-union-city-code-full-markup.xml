PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Union City of a general and permanent nature. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through January 1977, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the third section of Chapter 6 is 6-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-2 and 3-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-2.1, 3-2.2 and 3-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 11 and 12, it will be designated as Chapter 11.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Sonya Carter, City Administrator/Clerk and Mr. William McNally, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided shall apply to the amendment of any Code section whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance.

Section 5. Any and all additions and amendments to the Code, when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the mayor and council to make the same a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code shall be understood and intended to include the additions and amendments.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
  
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omitted."

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-15. - Altering Code.

The case shall be docketed and tried as in other cases, and if the defendant corporation fails to appear at the trial, or appearing, fails to plead, the presiding officer of the court shall cause to be entered a plea of not guilty and the trial shall proceed as though the defendant had appeared and pleaded. Upon conviction, the corporation shall be fined as provided for by the ordinance or by the section of the Code violated, and execution shall issue for the same as provided in Charter section 6-103; provided, however, that to such an execution, such corporation shall have the right to file its illegality as provided in cases of executions for paving assessments.

                  Sec. 2-94. - Employee drug policy. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The mayor and council finds that the manufacture, distribution, sale, use, or possession of controlled substances, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs in an unlawful manner is a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare. The mayor and council further finds that the use of alcohol during or prior to working hours is prohibited where alcohol can be measured at the level of .02 grams during working hours, said level being presumptively adverse to the safety of the workplace. It is declared to be a primary purpose and goal of this city, and of all of its public officials and employees to take all reasonable steps possible to eradicate the unlawful manufacture, distribution, sale, use, and possession of controlled substances, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs; and further to take all reasonable steps to eradicate the use of alcohol where a level of .02 grams exists, such level adversely affecting the safety of the workplace. With this purpose in mind, the mayor and council declares that its work force must be absolutely free of any person who would knowingly manufacture, distribute, sell, use, or possess a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug in an unlawful manner; and from any person whose use of alcohol results in a level of .02 grams during working hours. For this reason, and pursuant to Chapter 23 of Title 45 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, the mayor and council enacts this section. 
                  (b)  Definitions. As used in this section the term: 
                  City means Union City, Georgia. 
                  City employee means any person employed by the city. 
                  Controlled substance means any drug, substance, or immediate precursor included in Schedules I through V of O.C.G.A. sections 16-13-25 through 16-13-29 and Schedules I through V of 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1308. 
                  Convicted or conviction refers to a final conviction in a court of competent jurisdiction or the acceptance of a plea of guilty. 
                  Criminal drug statute means any criminal statute involving the manufacture, sale, distribution, dispensation, use, or possession of any controlled substance or marijuana. 
                  Dangerous drug means any drug or substance defined as such under O.C.G.A. section 16-13-71. 
                  Marijuana means all parts of the plant of the genus Cannabis, whether growing or not, the seeds thereof, the resin extracted from any part of such plant, and shall include the completely defoliated mature stalks of such plant, or fiber produced from such stalks. 
                  Safety sensitive employees means all employees of Union City with the exception of the following positions: Cashier clerk; accounts technician; permit/tax/license technician; accounts payable technician; receptionist; part-time court clerk assistant; and part-time records clerk. 
                  Under the influence of drugs/alcohol means testing positive for the presence of illegal drugs or a blood alcohol test result of .02 grams or more. 
                  (c)  Violation. It shall be a violation of this policy for any city employee to be under the influence of a controlled substance or alcohol while on the work premises or elsewhere as a result of job requirements during working hours while the employee is at work. Any city employee in possession of, selling, distributing, trafficking or manufacturing any controlled substance shall be in violation of this policy. 
                  (d)  Prescription drugs. Any city employee under his/her doctor's orders to take prescription medication, and who is requested to undergo drug testing, shall notify his/her immediate supervisor, prior to the testing, if that employee is currently taking the prescribed medication. Any person who has been offered employment with the city in a position that has been designated as high risk, and is under his/her doctor's orders to take prescription medication, and is currently taking the prescribed medication, shall notify the human resources director, prior to the mandatory preemployment testing. 
                  (e)  Random drug testing. Due to the potential serious consequences of a city employee attempting to perform his/her job functions while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, all safety sensitive city employees are subject to random drug/alcohol testing. Nonsensitive city employees, as listed in (a) above, under the definition for "safety sensitive employees", may also volunteer to participate in the random drug testing. Volunteer participation in the random drug testing may be accomplished by the nonsensitive employee submitting a signed and notarized certificate to their department head, who will approve the voluntary participation in writing and forward the completed certificate to the human resources director for enclosure in the employee's personnel folder. All persons who have been offered employment with the city must undergo drug/alcohol testing as a precondition to employment. All employees are subject to the same disciplinary measures contained in this article for their refusal to undergo the testing.

Any city employee who demonstrates an unexplained inability to perform his/her normal job functions safely or productively, and/or exhibits characteristics consistent with the use of a controlled substance or alcohol (e.g., slurred speech, unsteady gait, etc.) will be required to undergo a drug/alcohol test to determine whether or not a violation of this policy has occurred. Whenever any supervisor detects any evidence of alcohol, drugs or controlled substances in the work place, such evidence shall constitute reasonable suspicion that an employee is in violation of this policy. 
                  (g)  Procedures for reasonable suspicion drug/alcohol testing. Any supervisor who has reason to believe an employee is under the influence of drugs/alcohol, in a nonemergency situation, shall contact the city administrator, or his/her designee, to obtain approval prior to requesting the employee to undergo the testing. In a nonemergency situation, one (1) or more additional supervisors shall observe the employee to corroborate that reasonable suspicion exists warranting a drug/alcohol test. 
                  The employee shall be requested by the supervisor to undergo a drug/alcohol test. If the employee should refuse to submit to the testing, disciplinary measures shall be taken against the employee, ranging from a minimum five-day suspension from work without pay up to and including termination, for refusing to submit to the testing and for insubordination. The next time a supervisor requests the employee to undergo a drug/alcohol test based upon the supervisor's suspicion that the employee is under the influence of drugs/alcohol, if the employee should refuse to submit to the testing the employee will be terminated. 
                  The employee, after consenting to the testing, shall be transported by the city to the testing facility. Following the test, the employee shall be suspended with pay pending an investigation and the test results. If the test results are positive, the employee will be afforded an opportunity to explain. If no justifiable explanation exists, disciplinary action will be taken up to and including termination. If the test is negative, the supervisor will explain this to the employee and the employee will be assured that this matter has been concluded and nothing will be placed in the employee's personnel file. The employee will then immediately assume his/her job responsibilities. 
                  (h)  Confidential information. Information concerning suspected controlled substance use and testing results shall be placed in locked files separate from the routine personnel files. Such information shall be communicated only to those individuals who need to know the information in order to perform their job functions. 
                  (i)  Suspension or termination of city employee convicted of drug offense. 
                  (1)  Any city employee who is convicted for the first time, under the laws of this state, the United States, or any other state, of any criminal offense involving the manufacture, distribution, sale, or possession of a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug shall be subject to disciplinary action, ranging from a minimum five-day suspension from work without pay up to and including termination. Any such employee not terminated shall be required to complete a drug abuse treatment and education program licensed under O.C.G.A. Chapter 5 of Title 26. 
                  (2)  Any city employee who is convicted for a second or subsequent time, under the laws of this state, the United States, or any other state, of any criminal offense involving the manufacture, distribution, sale, or possession of a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug shall be terminated from his/her employment. 
                  (j)  Ineligibility for city employment of person convicted of drug offense. 
                  (1)  Any person who has been convicted for the first time, under the laws of this state, the United States, or any other state, of any criminal offense involving the manufacture, distribution, sale, use or possession of a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug shall be ineligible for any city employment for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of conviction. 
                  (2)  Any person who has been convicted two (2) or more times, under the laws of this state, the United States, or any other state, of any criminal offense involving the manufacture, distribution, sale, or possession of a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug shall be ineligible for any city employment for a period of five (5) years from the most recent date of conviction. 
                  (k)  Last chance policy. If, prior to an arrest for an offense involving a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug, a city employee notifies the city that the employee illegally uses a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug and is receiving or agrees to receive treatment under a drug abuse treatment and education program licensed under O.C.G.A. Chapter 5 of Title 26 and approved by the city, the employee shall be entitled to maintain city employment for up to one (1) year as long as the employee follows the treatment plan. During this period, the city employee shall not be separated from city employment solely on the basis of the employee's drug dependence, but the employee's work activities may be restructured if practicable to protect persons or property. 
                  No statement made by an employee to a supervisor of the city employee or other person in order to comply with this section shall be admissible in any civil, administrative, or criminal proceeding as evidence against the city employee. The rights granted by this code section shall be available to a city employee only once during a five-year period and shall not apply to any city employee who has refused to be tested or who has tested positive for a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug.

                  Sec. 3-297. - Nudity restricted. 
                  (a)  Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Dekalb County, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; and Richmond County, Georgia; which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by Union City, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among general comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of this council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars," or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section is hereby adopted. 
                  (b)  The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve, or dispense alcoholic beverages for consumption on such premises within the city limits of Union City: 
                  (1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume, or clothing, as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or of any portion of the male or female pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva and genitals. 
                  (2)  Live entertainment where any person appears in the manner described in paragraph (1) of this section or where such persons (or person) perform(s) acts of, or acts which simulate any of the following: 
                  a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, or any sexual act which is prohibited by law; 
                  b.  The caressing or fondling of the breasts, buttocks, anus or genitals; 
                  c.  The displaying of the male or female pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals. 
                  (3)  The holding, promotion, sponsoring or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night, event or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the conduct described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above; provided, however, that nothing contained in this section (b) shall apply to the premises of any mainstream performance house, museum or theater which derives less than twenty (20) percent of its gross annual income from the sale of alcoholic beverages. 
                  (c)  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the mayor and council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this enactment are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section hereof shall be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any Court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this enactment, since the same would have been enacted by the mayor and council without the incorporation herein of any such unconstitutional phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section. 
                  (d)  All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2018-12 , § 6, adopted Dec. 18, 2018, changed the title of § 3-380 from "Temporary or flashing signs to identify licensed premises prohibited; extinguishing lighted signs on Sundays" to read as herein set out. 
                  Sec. 3-381. - Nudity restricted. 
                  (a)  Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Dekalb County, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; and Richmond County, Georgia; which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by Union City, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among general comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of this council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars," or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section is hereby adopted. 
                  (b)  The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve, or dispense alcoholic beverages for consumption on such premises within the city limits of Union City: 
                  (1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume, or clothing, as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or of any portion of the male or female pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva and genitals. 
                  (2)  Live entertainment where any person appears in the manner described in paragraph (1) of this section or where such persons (or person) perform(s) acts of, or acts which simulate any of the following:

In any instance of failure or refusal to abate a nuisance after ordered to do so by the city court, and the abatement thereof by the police department, the cost thereof shall be collected by execution, levy and sale as in cases of taxes due the city. 
                  (e)  Issuance of execution.

                  ARTICLE IX. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 

                  Sec. 9-220. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  It is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Union City, hereinafter, the "city", and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor the effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor the effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
                  (b)  Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the Mayor and Council, and on studies in other communities including but not limited to the Analysis of the Relationships Between Adult Entertainment Establishments, Crime, and Housing Values performed by the Minnesota Crime Prevention Center, Inc., October, 1980; the experience of the Cities of College Park, Forest Park, Marietta, and Smyrna, the mayor and council finds: 
                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary, unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. The commercial exploitation of human sexuality, in all forms in which such exploitation may be manifested has a deleterious effect on the community where it takes place as heretofore mentioned and that such effects are intensified and exacerbated when such is provided in conjunction with the service or consumption of alcohol. Sexually oriented businesses cause an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including but not limited to disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. 
                  (2)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
                  (3)  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. Further, such establishments escalate undesirable community conditions, including blight, diminished property values, and cause increases in the need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, and increases in the burden on the judicial system as a result of the criminal behavior which the mayor and council finds such business establishments bring to a community. The negative effects such businesses cause are not limited to such facilities that offer live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts but that other forms of sexually oriented businesses also have deleterious effect on nearby neighborhoods, commercial districts and on urban life in general. These other types of such businesses include but are not limited to adult bookstores, peep shows, massage parlors, bathhouses, adult gift and novelty shops, and lingerie or nude modeling studios. 
                  (4)  Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses. AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components. 
                  (5)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities there are unhealthy, and in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
                  (6)  The findings noted in paragraphs (1) through (5) raise substantial governmental concerns. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
                  (7)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
                  (8)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult entertainment establishments. 
                  (9)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
                  (10)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
                  (11)  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article.

                  Sec. 10-25. - Loitering for purpose of procuring others to engage in sexual acts for hire. 
                  (a)  Legislative findings and intent. 
                  (1)  The mayor and council finds that sex acts for hire are inherently exploitative, endanger the health, safety and welfare of the participants and citizens in general, affect property values, and are an affront to the dignity of our citizens. These exploitative acts adversely affect a property or area in which they occur and lead to the avoidance of such places by law-abiding citizens, increased opportunity for unlawful criminal activities, and further decay of neighborhoods. 
                  (2)  The City has a strong interest: (i) in ensuring that citizens feel safe in their neighborhoods; (ii) in protecting the health of its citizens; (iii) in safeguarding the economic vitality of its business districts; and (iv) in preserving peace and order in public places to enable them to be used for their intended purpose. 
                  (3)  The mayor and council find that loitering for the purpose of procuring others to engage in sex acts for hire usually includes a power imbalance between those seeking to purchase the sexual services and those being exploited to perform the sex acts, with the persons procuring the sexual services tending to be more economically and socially advantaged than the people who would provide the sex acts. A person seeking to purchase the sexual services bears a greater responsibility for the transaction than does the person being prostituted. Furthermore, it is widely acknowledged by criminal justice experts that holding purchasers, or "johns," principally accountable for these sex acts for hire is the most effective method available to reduce the incidence of prostitution in an area. 
                  (4)  This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising the right to assemble or engage in any constitutionally protected activity. This section applies to all persons with the requisite intent to induce another to engage in sex acts for hire. 
                  (b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, as defined in section 10-64, in or near any thoroughfare or place open to the public in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose of inducing, enticing, soliciting, pandering or procuring another to commit a sexual act for hire. 
                  (c)  A law enforcement officer who observes a person loitering under circumstances that provide the officer with an articulable suspicion to believe a sexual act for hire has occurred or is occurring may detain the individual for the purpose of investigating whether the person is in violation of this section. 
                  (d)  A law enforcement officer may detain an individual under this section if an element from subsection (1) and an element from subsection (2) or both elements from subsection (3) below are satisfied: 
                  (1)  The person engages in one (1) or more of the following behaviors: 
                  a.  Repeatedly circling the block in a motor vehicle; 
                  b.  Stopping a motor vehicle in a public roadway to beckon to, stop, or engage with persons on the side of the road; 
                  c.  Repeatedly stopping or attempting to stop motor vehicle operators by hailing, waiving of arms or any bodily gesture; or 
                  d.  Driving around or sitting in a parked car in a parking lot or vacant lot. 
                  (2)  One (1) of the following factors applies: 
                  a.  The officer has knowledge of a specific reliable tip concerning unlawful prostitution-related activity at a specific location, and the person who is found loitering is doing so at a time, in a place or in a manner that is otherwise consistent with the details provided in the tip; 
                  b.  The person is loitering in an area that is known to be a common location for prostitution-related activity; 
                  c.  The person is on the premises of a hotel or other business that is associated with an advertisement for prostitution-related activity; 
                  d.  The person is a non-resident of the area and is present in the area outside of normal business hours and without legitimate business in the area; 
                  e.  The officer knows that the person has been previously convicted of loitering with the intention of procuring others to engage in sexual acts for hire under this section; or 
                  f.  Any vehicle the person has approached or communicated through is registered to an individual who has been convicted of an unlawful prostitution-related activity in the previous three (3) years, and the officer is aware of that fact. 
                  (3)  a.  The person enters or is present in a hotel room that is not registered to said person; and 
                  b.  The person is on the premises of a hotel that is associated with an advertisement for prostitution-related activity. 
                  (e)  For purposes of this section "sexual act for hire" means conduct which constitutes an offense defined in O.C.G.A. Tit. 16, Ch. 6, as amended; conduct which constitutes complicity to commit such an offense; or conduct which constitutes conspiracy to commit such an offense. 
                  (f)  Any person in violation of this section shall be guilty of the offense of loitering for the purpose of committing a sexual act for hire.

                  Sec. 10-27. - Loitering with the purpose of using, possessing, or selling any controlled substance.

                  Sec. 10-54. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to regulate the installation and use of police and fire alarm systems and to establish standards for, controls of, and maintenance of the various alarm systems that are intended to bring about police and/or fire department response. 
                  (Ord. No. 90-8, 4-17-90) 
                  Sec. 10-55. - Definitions. 
                  (a)  Alarm system shall mean an assembly of equipment and devices designated and arranged to detect and signal an unauthorized intrusion into a premise, to signal an attempted robbery at protected premises, a fire on premises, a medical emergency needing medical attention, and/or an ambulance, or like occurrences. 
                  (b)  False alarms shall mean the activation of an alarm system where none of the emergencies for which the alarm system has been installed have, in fact, occurred. 
                  (c)  Response shall mean the dispatch of police, fire equipment, ambulance, or other appropriate equipment for the emergency signal, to the premises where the alarm system has been activated indicating such emergency is present. 
                  (d)  Licensing authority means the City of Union City, Georgia, through the police and fire chief of said city. 
                  (e)  Police and fire chief means the chief of police of the Union City Police Department, and the fire chief of the Union City Fire Department, and/or their authorized representatives.

                  Sec. 10-56. - Alarm system permits; false alarms. 
                  (a)  Application for permits. Any property owner or lessee of property in the City of Union City having or installing on his or her premises an alarm system which is designed to directly contact the Union City Department of Public Safety (Police or Fire) shall apply to the licensing authority for a permit to have such a device on his or her premises. Application for permits for alarm systems which are designed to directly contact the Union City Department of Public Safety (Police or Fire) existing on premises on the effective date of this section must be made to the licensing authority within thirty (30) days. Application for renewal permits must be submitted annually thereafter. No such alarm system may be installed on the premises of the owner or lessee after the effective date of this section prior to the licensing authority having issued a permit to such owner or lessee. No presently existing alarm system designed to directly contact the Union City Department of Public Safety (Police or Fire) shall be modified after the effective date of this ordinance prior to the issuance of a permit to such owner or lessee by the licensing authority. 
                  (b)  Permit fees. The annual permit fee for an alarm system designed to directly contact the Union City Department of Public Safety (Police or Fire) shall be fifty dollars ($50.00). 
                  (c)  False alarm. This subsection is intended to cover the activation of a signal from an alarm system which elicits a response from the police or fire and rescue department when there is in fact no emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity necessitating such a response. This definition includes, without being limited to, any alarm system signal activated as a result of weather, negligence, accident, mechanical failure, electrical failure, electrical surge, signals activated intentionally in non-emergency situations and signals activated where the actual cause of such activation is unknown. There is a rebuttable presumption that an activated alarm system signal is a false alarm if the responding personnel, after following normal procedures in their response and investigation, find no evidence of unauthorized entry, criminal activity or other emergency. An activated alarm system signal shall not be considered a false alarm if: 
                  (1)  The police or fire and rescue department is notified to cancel its response by the alarm user or the alarm user's monitoring agent prior to the time emergency personnel arrive at the premises; 
                  (2)  The alarm system signal was intentionally activated by an individual based upon a reasonable belief that an emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity requiring immediate response existed; or 
                  (3)  The alarm system signal was activated by lightning or other acts of nature resulting in an electrical surge which causes physical damage to the alarm system evidenced by the written report of a licensed alarm system contractor who conducted an inspection of the system at the premises and personally observed such physical damage. 
                  (d)  [Residential false alarm response.] For each police or fire response to a false alarm at a residence, a responding officer shall issue the following: 
                  (1)  For the first three (3) false alarms within a calendar year, no citation shall be issued, but the resident or property owner shall be issued a warning notice; 
                  (2)  For the fourth and fifth false alarm within a calendar year, the resident or property owner shall be issued a municipal court citation and the minimum fine shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) per citation; 
                  (3)  For the sixth false alarm within a calendar year, the resident or property owner shall be issued a municipal court citation and the minimum fine shall be one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per citation; and 
                  (4)  For the seventh and subsequent false alarms within a calendar year, the resident or property owner shall be issued a municipal court citation and the fine shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per citation. 
                  (e)  [Commercial false alarm response.] For each police or fire response to a false alarm at a commercial establishment, a responding officer shall issue the following: 
                  (1)  For the first three (3) false alarms within a calendar year, no citation shall be issued, but the business owner or his/her agent shall be issued a warning notice; 
                  (2)  For the fourth and fifth false alarm within a calendar year, the business owner or his/her agent shall be issued a municipal court citation and the minimum fine shall be five hundred dollars ($500.00) per citation; and 
                  (3)  For the sixth and subsequent false alarms within a calendar year, the business owner or his/her agent shall be issued a municipal court citation and the fine shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per citation. 
                  Should any municipal court fine go unpaid, the city shall withhold the issuance of an occupation tax certificate until all fines are paid to the municipal court. 
                  (f)  Renewal. All holders of alarm system permits must tender an annual permit fee to the licensing authority on or before January 1 of each year. 
                  (g)  Connection. No one may connect an alarm system to directly notify the Union City Department of Public Safety (police or fire) without first obtaining an alarm system permit. All costs incurred in such hookup shall be borne by the permittee. No one may place, install, or otherwise locate, or cause to be placed, installed, or otherwise located, any central station equipment for direct connection of alarm systems within the Union City Department of Public Safety (police or fire) without the prior consent of the Union City Department of Public Safety (police or fire). Upon suspension, revocation, or termination of such permit, the owner or lessee, as the case may be, shall immediately disconnect, or immediately cause to be disconnected, the alarm system. 
                  (h)  Alarm system description. The permittee must possess a written description of the function and operation of the alarm system installed on the premises, along with the procedure and means for activating or deactivating the same. 
                  (i)  Individual requirement. Every permittee shall furnish to the Union City Department of Public Safety (police or fire) the name and telephone number of the primary individual responsible for the alarm system and at least one (1) alternate name and telephone number of an individual who can deactivate the alarm system or systems. The permittee will be responsible for deactivating the alarm system within a reasonable time following notification by the Union City Department of Public Safety (police or fire).

                  (b)  After the effective date of this article, any person who intentionally activates any alarm system for any reason other than to warn of an actual burglary, holdup, robbery, or fire or during controlled testing of equipment shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or up to thirty (30) days in jail, or both. 
                  (c)  No person shall operate any audible alarm system that does not have an automatic thirty (30) minute shut off after activation.

                  (Ord. No. 2004-18, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 2011-16, §§ 2—5, 10-18-11; Ord. No. 2014-02, § 1, 3-18-14) 
                  Sec. 11-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sediment control measures. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sediment control plans. Soil erosion and sediment control measures and practices shall conform to the requirements of subsections 11-34(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installation drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sediment pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 11-34(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with section 11-34(b)(2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f). As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia; specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the Division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land-disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential. 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable. 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures must be installed as soon as practicable. 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills. 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners. 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are not feasible and provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum. 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments onsite or preclude sedimentation of adjacent streams beyond the levels specified in section 11-34(b)(2) of this article. 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsections (16) and (17) of this section, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all stale waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implement; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events, that has a channel located above the groundwater table year-round, for which groundwater is not a source of water, and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be construed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; causing a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented as: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (17)  There is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph, maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time alter damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a twenty-five-foot buffer would consume at least eighteen (18) percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than five hundred (500) square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r) of the Rules of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than five thousand (5,000) square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 11-34(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for a project for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2004-18, § 1, 9-21-04; Ord. No. 2010-11B, § 7, 6-15-10; Ord. No. 2011-16, § 6, 10-18-11; Ord. No. 2018-10 , §§ 2, 3, 11-20-18) 
                  Sec. 11-35. - Application process. 
                  (a)  General. 
                  (1)  The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, this article, and other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdiction boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (2)  Wetlands as defined in 33 CFR Part 328.3(b) are an important resource, which are protected through the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended. This Act regulates all dredge and fill activities in waters of the U.S. and is aadministered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Land disturbing activities may require a Section 404 permit administered by the Army Corps of Engineers. The United States Department of Interior has prepared a national wetlands inventory map covering the City of Union City. The map is known as the Fairburn, Georgia National Wetlands Inventory Map (2-ATL-E5) and is incorporated in this article by reference. To assist applicants for land disturbance permits, the city has available for public inspection a copy of the Fairburn National Wetlands inventory map. It is encouraged that permit applicants for land disturbance use this map as a resource to identify wetlands. Permit applicants are cautioned, however, that all wetlands may not be identified by this map and the responsibility for defining wetlands and securing any necessary state or federal permits rests solely with the applicant. Applicants for land disturbance permits are advised that only the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for certifying whether or not wetlands are present on the site, the city is not involved with Section 404 permitting. As a part of the process of obtaining a land disturbance permit, all applicants must complete and submit an "acknowledgment and certification" form provided by the city which acknowledges the applicant has investigated Section 404 permitting criteria and has determined whether or not the permit is required for the project for which a land disturbance permit has been requested. Should the applicant certify a Section 404 permit is not required, the city make a determination from the map as to whether or not the presence of wetlands is likely within the area in which the permit is requested. Should the city determine that the presence of wetlands is likely in the area the city may not issue the land disturbance permit. A determination by the city that the presence of wetlands is likely in the area requires the applicant obtain a determination made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If wetlands are present, the applicant must obtain a Section 404 permit prior to being issued a land disturbance permit. Should the applicant certify a Section 404 permit is required, the city may not issue a land disturbance permit until the applicant provides a copy of the Section 404 permit to the city. Any action by the city under this article does not relieve the property owner, developer, or petitioner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Union City without first obtaining a land disturbance permit from the issuing authority to perform such activity and providing a copy of the notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the issuing authority and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, at a minimum, the data specified in subsection 11-35(c) of this article. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of subsections 11-34(b) and (c) of this article. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five (5) copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
                  (3)  A fee shall be charged for each application as determined by the mayor and council for the City of Union City. The fee shall be based on each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  (4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority. 
                  (5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. no permit shall be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 11-34(c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per subsection 11-35(b)(7) have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (6)  If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to cash, cashier's check or money order up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with the ordinance or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained subsections 11-34(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved by the district and the issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 11-34(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 11-35(b)(7) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his or her successor in title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his or her successor in title is in violation of this article.

                  (a)  The City of Union City will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he or she shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The city manager or his/her designee shall have the power to conduct such investigations as he or she may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (c)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for purpose of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his or her official duties.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his occupation tax certificate, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director of the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he or she shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his or her performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 11-35(b)(7). The issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provision in any City Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred ($2,500.00) for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation. 
                  (e)  Incomplete landscape work. If landscaping is not established, the city manager or his/her designee may approve issuance of a certificate of occupancy conditioned on provision of cash, cashier's check or money order to be deposited in an escrow account in the amount of one hundred ten (110) percent of the city engineer's estimate of the cost of completing all required work. The cash deposit shall be held for a period of eighteen (18) months. In the event that the landscaping work is not complete prior to the date on which said eighteen (18) months expires, the city shall be entitled to use said cash deposit to complete the landscape work on behalf of the property owner. At the time of the acceptance of the cash deposit, the permittee, builder or owner shall sign a document informing him or her of the provisions necessary to complete the landscape work. The document referred to herein shall be signed by the permittee, builder or owner prior to the time a certificate of occupancy is issued.

                  (b)  For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one (1) person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission present on site whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbing site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 
                  (c)  Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this article. 
                  (d)  If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph.

                  (a)  Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the mayor and council of the City of Union City within sixty (60) days after receipt by the issuing authority of written notice of appeal. 
                  (b)  Judicial review. Any person, aggrieved by a decision or order of the local issuing authority, after exhausting his or her administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal de novo to the Superior Court of Fulton County.

                  (b)  Liability. 
                  (1)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (2)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  ARTICLE IV. - UNION CITY CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVER TRIBUTARY PROTECTION ORDINANCE 

                  Sec. 11-50. - Short title. 
                  This ordinance will be known as the "Union City Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. No. 99-10, 4-20-99) 
                  Sec. 11-51. - Statutory authorization. 
                  This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the requirements of section 12-5-453 of O.C.G.A. 
                  (Ord. No. 99-10, 4-20-99) 
                  Sec. 11-52. - Finding and purposes. 
                  (a)  Findings. The mayor and council of the City of Union City finds that: 
                  (1)  The Chattahoochee River provides multiple public benefits, which include use of the river as the primary water supply for metropolitan Atlanta. 
                  (2)  The water quality of the Chattahoochee River depends upon the water quality of the flowing streams tributary to the river. 
                  (3)  Sediment and other polluting materials and conditions, including but not limited to pesticides, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, toxic materials, and elevations in water temperature are harmful to the water quality of the river and its tributaries. 
                  (4)  The riparian vegetation along these watercourses helps preserve water quality. Dense tree and understory growth helps to prevent stream bank erosion, and stream-side vegetation reduces the amount of sediment and other polluting materials that would otherwise wash into streams. Riparian trees, by shading, help maintain cooler water temperatures and thus enhance water quality. 
                  (b)  Purposes. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion, siltation and water pollution; and to maintain stream water quality in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Create vegetative buffer areas adjacent to tributary streams in the drainage area. 
                  (2)  Minimize land-disturbing activities within such buffer areas by requiring issuance of a permit for such activities. 
                  (Ord. No. 99-10, 4-20-99) 
                  Sec. 11-53. - Definitions. 
                  Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection Area or protection area means the stream channel and the land area extending outward thirty-five (35) horizontal feet from the banks on either side of all flowing streams in the drainage basin of all tributaries of the Chattahoochee River which enters the Chattahoochee River downstream from Buford Dam and upstream of the southern limits of Douglas County on the west side of the river and the southern limits of Fulton County on the east side of the river, except for such land within the Chattahoochee River Corridor, as defined in section 12-5-441 of O.C.G.A. 
                  Flowing stream means any stream which is designated and shown as a permanent stream on the 7.5 minutes quadrangle maps of the U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, plus any stream which the mayor and council of the City of Union City may determine to be, and designate as, a flowing stream. 
                  Land-disturbing activity means scraping, plowing, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting, or filling of land or placement of any structure or impervious surface, dam, obstruction or deposit.

                  (b)  Application for a permit. A separate application for a permit shall be made to the permits clerk, on a form approved by the permits clerk, for each land-disturbing activity, except that only one application need be made for two (2) or more such acts which are to be done on the same parcel. The application shall include a map of the site and such information concerning the proposed action as the permits clerk deems necessary to describe the nature and extent of the proposed action and to determine the effect of the proposed action on the protection area. 
                  (c)  Issuance of permit. No application for a permit shall be approved and no permit shall be issued for any land-disturbing activity within the protection area unless: 
                  (1)  The land-disturbing activity is for the purpose of constructing one (1) of the following: a stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or public utility; a dam and/or impoundment; or 
                  (2)  The land-disturbing activity is within a right-of-way of any public agency pursuant to a permit issued by such public agency; or

                  (1)  Limit erosion, sedimentation and water pollution within the protection zone to amounts and rates no greater than those occurring before the land-disturbing activity; and 
                  (2)  Preserve, protect or replace the maximum feasible amount of natural vegetation. 
                  (e)  Variance.

The mayor and council shall give public notice of each such public hearing at least two (2) weeks prior to the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Union City. 
                  (f)  Responsibility. Neither the issuance of a permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this ordinance shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon the City of Union City, its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property. A permit issued pursuant to this ordinance does not relieve the permittee of the responsibility of securing and complying with any other permit required by any other city ordinance or state law. 
                  (g)  Term of permit; extension; renewal. The permittee shall complete the work authorized by the permit within the time limits specified in the permit, which in no case shall extend more than twelve (12) months from the date of issuance. The permittee shall notify the permits clerk at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the commencement of work. Should the work not be commenced and completed within the time limits, then the permit shall become void; provided, however, that if prior to the date established for commencement of work, the permittee makes written request to the permits clerk for an extension of time to commence the work, setting forth the reasons for the required extension, the permits clerk may grant such extension. A permit which has become void may be renewed at the discretion of the permits clerk. 
                  (h)  Inspection. The permits clerk may cause inspections of the work to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work. The permittee shall assist the permits clerk in making such inspections. The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land-disturbing activities within a protection area. No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (i)  Cash deposit. Prior to the issuance of any permit for land-disturbing activities within the protection area, the applicant shall submit cash, cashier's check or money order to be deposited in an escrow account which shall ensure that all terms and conditions of the permit are complied with. The cash deposit shall pertain to and recite therein an exact description of the property in question. The length of time for which the cash deposit shall be held shall be determined by the city engineer, and shall be specified in writing. The cash deposit shall be in an amount equal to twice the estimated cost for carrying out the land-disturbing activity in compliance with all terms and conditions of the permit. The sum of the cash deposit shall be made payable to the City of Union City.

                  (b)  Stop-work orders. Upon notice from the permits clerk, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this ordinance shall be immediately stopped. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed or the site restored to its original condition or its equivalent. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required. 
                  (c)  Performance bond forfeiture.

The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the permit and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance and, in addition to other penalties, his performance bond shall be subject to forfeiture. 
                  (d)  Suspension, revocation or modification of permit. The permit may be suspended, revoked or modified by the permits clerk upon finding that the holder is in violation of the terms of the permit or any portion of this ordinance.

                  Land development project means a discrete land development undertaking. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one (1) or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term includes any structure commonly referred to as a "mobile home" regardless of the date of manufacture. The term also includes parked trailers, travel trailers and similar transportable structures placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced after the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by Union City as a basis for city participation in NFIP, and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure.

                  Regulatory flood means the flood standard equal to or higher than the base flood. The regulatory flood is defined as the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year assuming the drainage basin is fully developed as shown on the current land use plan. Only structural stormwater control facilities that can be shown will remain (i.e. owned by the City of Union City) and are large enough to be included in the hydrograph routings shall be considered when determining the flood peak. 
                  Regulatory flood elevation means the flood standard equal to or higher than the base flood elevation. The regulatory flood elevation is defined as the highest water surface anticipated at any given point during the regulatory flood.

                  Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article that permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.

                  b.  Reducing the regulatory flood storage capacity. All compensation for storage capacity shall occur either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed, or within a permanent, recorded flood control easement, and shall be within a reasonable proximity to the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include: lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain; or, lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain; or raising of the regulatory flood elevation within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed. All cut areas are to be graded to a slope of no less than 1.0 percent. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (predevelopment) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel. A step-backwater analysis will be required to determine the volume of flood storage created by raising the regulatory flood elevation; 
                  c.  Changing the flow characteristics of the waters of the regulatory flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the property. Verification shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis; or 
                  d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. In all cases effective transitions must be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased. 
                  (2)  All proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
                  (3)  Any significant changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the City of Union City using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six (6) months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as built surveys which demonstrate general conformance to the approved designs as submitted in the CLOMR application. A letter of map revision (LOMR) or letter of map amendment (LOMA) must be issued before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. Significant changes or revisions shall be defined as any change to the FIRM easily observed when plotted at a scale of 1" = 1,000'. The changes or revisions may be due to, but are not limited to, more current and/or superior topographic information or compensatory cut and fill grading done as a part of the development. 
                  (d)  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb the regulatory floodplain. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Union City prior to the approval of any permit that would authorize the disturbance of land located within the floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  (1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  (2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a method approved by the City of Union City. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood and regulatory flood profiles; 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one (1) every one hundred (100) feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that regulatory floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
                  (4)  If changes to the regulatory flood elevation are proposed, profiles of the channel showing the existing and proposed regulatory flood elevations must be provided; and 
                  (5)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all floodplain encroachments. 
                  (e)  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except when required for the construction of bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the preproject base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the regulatory or base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  (2)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the business license, tax, and permit department until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable, is issued by FEMA. 
                  (f)  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The City of Union City may direct the property owner at no cost to the City of Union City to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with Union City. This shall be done at property owner's expense.

                  (b)  Building standards for structures and buildings within the floodplain. 
                  (1)  Residential buildings. 
                  a.  New construction. New construction of principal buildings, including manufactured homes shall not be allowed within the limits of the floodplain. 
                  b.  Substantial improvements. Substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than three (3) feet above the base flood elevation adjacent to the building or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation, whichever is highest. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 11-87(a)(5), elevated buildings. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential buildings. 
                  a.  New construction. New construction of principal buildings, including manufactured homes shall not be allowed within the limits of the floodplain. 
                  b.  Substantial improvements. Substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be authorized by the city administrator to be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation, whichever is highest, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the city administrator. 
                  (3)  Accessory structures and facilities. Accessory structures and facilities (i.e., barns, sheds, gazebos, detached garages, parking lots, recreational facilities and other similar structures and facilities) which are permitted to be located within the limits of the floodplain shall be designed and constructed to pass all floodwater in a manner consistent with this article. 
                  (4)  Standards for recreational vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  a.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  b.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "Residential Buildings—Substantial Improvements", including the anchoring and elevation requirements above. 
                  (5)  Building standards for structures and buildings authorized adjacent to the floodplain. 
                  a.  Residential buildings. For new construction or substantial improvement of any principal residential building or manufactured home, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement and access to the building, shall be at least three (3) feet above the level of the highest base flood (100-year) elevation adjacent to the building or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation whichever is highest. 
                  b.  Nonresidential buildings. For new construction or substantial improvement of any principal non-residential building, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement and access to the building, shall be at least one (1) foot above the level of the highest base flood (100-year) elevation adjacent to the building or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation whichever is highest. 
                  (6)  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones) or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the city administrator shall review and reasonably utilize any available scientific or historic base flood elevation or regulatory flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions and standards of this section. If sufficient data are not available from these sources, then the city administrator may accept a hydrologic assessment performed by a registered professional engineer to determine the regulatory flood and floodway elevations. 
                  (7)  Building standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO-zones). Areas of special flood hazard may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. In these areas the following provisions apply: 
                  a.  All substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards for "Elevated Buildings." The applicant's or owner's engineer shall certify to the City Administrator that the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file; 
                  b.  Substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one (1) foot above the highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice; and 
                  c.  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  (8)  Standards for subdivisions. 
                  a.  All subdivision proposals shall identify the special flood hazard area and provide base flood and regulatory flood elevation data; 
                  b.  All subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed structure(s) and pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood or regulatory flood elevation, the lowest flood and pad elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the city administrator; 
                  c.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  d.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; and

                  Sec. 11-88. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The mayor and council as established for the City of Union City shall hear and decided requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The mayor and council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the mayor and council, any taxpayer or any officer, department, board or bureau of Union City may within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the mayor and council, but not thereafter, seek review of such decision by a court as provided by law. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the mayor and council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is a: 
                  a.  Finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, or cause fraud on or victimization of the public. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The city administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the mayor and council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  a.  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  1.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
                  2.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship. 
                  b.  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  (3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
                  a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
                  b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
                  d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
                  e.  At least one (1) alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
                  f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
                  g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
                  h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
                  (4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
                  a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
                  c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and 
                  d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
                  e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
                  f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment as denial of the variance.

                  Sec. 11-153. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the city's greenspace plans; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
                  (b)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (c) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one (1) or more of the following criteria: 
                  (1)  New development that involves the creation of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one (1) acre or more; 
                  (2)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one (1) acre or more; 
                  (3)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the city to be a hotspot land use; or 
                  (4)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items (1) and (2) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  (c)  [Exempt activities.] The following activities are exempt from this article: 
                  (1)  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
                  (2)  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
                  (3)  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
                  (4)  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the city. 
                  (d)  Designation of ordinance administrator. The city administrator or designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
                  (e)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (f)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
                  (g)  Stormwater design manual. Union City will utilize the policy, criteria and information including technical specifications and standards in the latest edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and any relevant local addenda (or equivalent local stormwater management design manual), for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article. The manual may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring and local maintenance experience.

                  (3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (b)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three (3) approaches: 
                  (1)  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  (2)  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  (3)  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (c)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm under section 11-156(b) is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the twenty-five-year return frequency storm event must be provided. This requirementshall not apply if a post-development downstream analysis of the site is both acceptable to the city and shows that uncontrolled post development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or the analysis, being acceptable to the city, shows that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
                  (d)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. This requirement shall not apply if a post-development downstream analysis of the site is both acceptable to the city and shows that uncontrolled post development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or the analysis, being acceptable to the city, shows that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
                  (e)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (f)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one (1) or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 11-156(a). The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (g)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, flared end sections, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one (1) parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements. 
                  (1)  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
                  (2)  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and 
                  (3)  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual. 
                  (h)  Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.

The city manager's decision of whether to grant or deny the modification request shall be determined as set forth in sections 12-105(4) through 12-105(11). Submission of a change request will not impact the validity of the permit already issued, except upon written request of the producer.

                  (1)  Where the substantial risk is identified prior to the commencement of the filming, the city manager and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s). Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the city manager shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the city manager's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the department of purview. 
                  (2)  Where the substantial risk is not imminent and is identified after the commencement of the filming, the city manager and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s). Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the city manager shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the city manager's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the department of purview.

The stop work order may be issued without advance notice where the department of purview deems that a delay of the order will jeopardize public health and safety, and shall be lifted as quickly as possible after the risk is eliminated. The department of purview shall notify the city manager of the stop work order within two (2) hours of its issuance. The city manager and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, that will minimize the length and impact of the stop work order as decided by the producer, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s) as determined by the department of purview. 
                  (4)  Changes made to the permit pursuant to this subsection (c) shall not require payment of a change fee. 
                  (d)  Where the city manager, or a department of purview in consultation with the city manager, determines that the producer is violating material term(s) of the permit, the city manager shall decide the appropriate remedial actions after consulting with the department of purview and the producer. If the city manager and/or department of purview finds that a substantial public health or safety risk is arising from or caused by the material violation, the department of purview in consultation with the city manager may place an immediate stop work order on the filming without prior notice to the producer, and consultation with the producer shall occur after the work stoppage. The consultation between the city manager, department of purview and producer shall evaluate the nature and severity of the violation, whether the violation was intentional, whether permit modifications should be made, whether the stop work order should be lifted (where applicable), and what other actions should be taken (if any). Where the violation creates a substantial public health and/or safety risk, the remedial actions decided by the city manager will not be deemed final until the department of purview reviews the remedial actions and confirms that they will eliminate the health and safety risks.

                  (h)  Permits must prohibit a producer from acting as a representative or agent of the city, and from indicating city endorsement of the filming, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the city manager. This provision shall not prohibit the producer's use of the city logo in the filming credits. 
                  (i)  The city manager shall require that notification be given to residents and businesses within a three-block radius of a location for which a filming permit has been issued.

The notification must state that a filming permit has been issued, and must include the date(s), time(s), location(s) and activities that are authorized by the permit. Additionally, the city manager shall require that notification be given to the mayor and council for the city. The city manager shall determine the most effective means and timing of notification based upon factors such as the type of impact that the filming will have on the neighborhood, the time between receipt of the application and commencement of the filming, the producer's budget and previous communications from a neighborhood regarding notification preferences.

                  Section 1.

                  It is recognized by the City of Union City that Atlanta Gas Light Company will not be in position to construct a distribution system and provide gas service in the City of Union City for at least a year, and this franchise is granted with full recognition that there may be such delay. 
                  If at any time under any zoning regulations or similar regulations it becomes necessary for the Grantee to have the property rezoned or permits granted in order to construct, maintain or enlarge its distribution system, the City of Union City agrees to procure and grant such zoning, rezoning or permits as may be necessary. 
                  Section 2. The Grantee shall be entitled to charge for gas furnished by it such rates as are prescribed by the Georgia Public Service Commission or other lawful regulatory body of the State of Georgia.

The city council of said city, through its authorized representative or representatives, shall after the development period have the right to inspect and audit the books and records of the Grantee for the purpose of determining the amount of its revenue received from the sale of gas to residential and commercial, but not industrial customers, within said territorial limits. 
                  Section 4. All rights herein granted and authorized shall be subject to and governed only by this ordinance; provided, however, the city council expressly reserves unto itself all of its police power to adopt general ordinances necessary to protect the safety and welfare of the general public in relation to the rights hereby granted not inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  Section 5.

                  Section 7. This ordinance, after its passage according to law, and its acceptance by the Grantee, in writing duly filed with the city clerk, within sixty (60) days from the date of approval hereof by the mayor, shall become effective and in full force.

                  (5)  A failure on the part of the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company to pay the license fee herein provided for by the specified time herein stated shall cause the city clerk to issue execution thereon which shall be levied and collected by the city marshal as other tax executions are levied and collected. 
                  (6)  This ordinance, after its passage according to law, and thirty (30) days' notice of its passage being given by certified mail to the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company, shall become effective and in full force.

                  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this article, the city clerk (ex-officio treasurer, tax receiver, tax collector) shall be charged with the duty to administer the imposition, collection and enforcement of all taxes and special assessments levied or imposed by the city in accordance with the administrative procedures hereinafter set forth. To the extent this article fails to provide a designated procedure, said officer shall act in a manner established, if any, for county tax collectors under applicable state law. 
                  (b)  In determining the fair market value of property within its taxing jurisdiction, the city shall use the fair market value as finally determined for the property for county ad valorem tax purposes. 
                  (c)  Following adoption of its current fiscal year budget, the mayor and council shall, by resolution, adopt a millage rate upon which property subject to ad valorem tax shall be billed. Prior to adoption of said millage rate, the governing body shall publish the notice of proposed ad valorem tax rate as required by O.C.G.A. section 48-5-32. Millage rates shall be calculated using forty (40) percent of the assessed fair market value of the property upon which the tax is levied. 
                  (d)  The city clerk shall cause a bill to be sent to all taxpayers at the address last shown on the County Tax Digest by regular U.S. mail, with adequate postage affixed thereon; provided, however, failure by the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for nonpayment or late payment of the tax. The bill shall state the location or description of the property taxed, the fair market value of the property and its taxable value, and the amount of tax due thereon. The bill shall also state the due date after which taxes shall be in default. The bill may also contain such additional information as allowed by law or authorized by the Mayor and Council.

                  (a)  All ad valorem taxes shall be due and payable in full within sixty (60) days after notice, unless the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which case it shall be postponed until the first day following which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Supplemental ad valorem taxes and special assessments shall be due and payable on the date set forth in the ordinance imposing the tax or assessment. 
                  (b)  All taxes and assessments imposed by the city shall be paid in full in legal tender of the United States; except where specially authorized by law or ordinance of the mayor and council, no partial payment shall be accepted. 
                  (c)  Taxes and special assessments shall bear interest at the rate of one (1) percent per month from the date the tax or assessment is due until the date the tax or assessment is paid. For purposes of this section, any period of less than one (1) month shall be considered to be one (1) full month. The city clerk may waive the collection of any interest, in whole or in part, due the city on unpaid taxes or assessments whenever or to the extent that he or she reasonably determines that the delay in payment was attributable to the action or inaction of his or her department. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-11, § 3, 7-21-98; Ord. No. 2010-02, § 1, 3-8-10) 
                  Sec. 13-6. - Penalties. 
                  (a)  All penalties imposed by this article are part of the tax or assessment and are to be collected as such. The proceedings to collect the original tax, the tax constituted from penalties imposed, and the interest shall all be conducted in the same manner. Any provision of law for criminal prosecution shall not operate to relieve the taxpayer of any tax, penalty, or interest imposed by this article. 
                  (b)  In any instance in which any taxpayer fails to pay a tax or assessment within ninety (90) days of the due date, he shall pay a penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the tax due, together with interest as specified herein. 
                  (c)  The mayor and council may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of any amount due as a penalty under this article to the extent said body finds and determines the default giving rise to the penalty was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect or disregard of this article.

                  (a)  As soon as the last day for the payment of taxes and assessments has arrived, the city clerk shall notify in writing the taxpayer of the fact that the taxes have not been paid and that, unless paid within thirty (30) days, an execution shall be issued. 
                  (b)  The city clerk shall issue executions for the nonpayment of taxes and assessments at any time after thirty (30) days have elapsed since giving notice as provided in subsection (a) above. The execution shall identify the defendant in fi fa (taxpayer), the year(s) for which delinquent taxes are being executed, and the amount thereof. Execution shall be directed to "all and singular sheriffs and constables of the state." 
                  (c)  The city clerk shall cause all executions issued to be recorded on the General Execution Docket of the county where the property is located, in the case of real property, and, in the case of personal property, in the county of the taxpayer's residence if a resident of the state, otherwise in the county where any real or personal property of the taxpayer may be found. If the taxpayer is not a resident of the state and has no known real or personal property within the state, the execution shall be recorded in the county in which the act or activity giving rise to tax liability took place. 
                  (d)  All executions issued shall continue to bear interest in penalties at the rates established in this article for past due taxes and assessments. 
                  (e)  The city clerk shall cause all executions issued to be placed in the hands of the city marshal for collection or levy and sale of property. The marshal shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi fa. In the event he is unable to do so, the Marshal shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi fa's property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-7, § 5, 5-19-98) 
                  Sec. 13-8. - Levy of executions; sale of property. 
                  (a)  The director of the department of public safety is hereby designated as the Marshal of the City of Union City and delegated the duties set forth in this article. The marshal shall account for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. After first paying the city clerk the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi fa. 
                  (b)  In all cases of levying on real property, five (5) days written notice of the levy prior to the levy must be given personally or delivered by certified mail to the defendant in fi fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi fa therein. 
                  (c)  Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give twenty (20) days written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The twenty-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner of the land, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city clerk. 
                  (d)  When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi fa shall be given at least ten (10) days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or a lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than thirty (30) days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his delegate not less than twenty-five (25) days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. 
                  (e)  The marshal shall publish weekly for four (4) weeks in the official legal organ of the city an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property as being sold for collection of taxes due to the City of Union City and the year(s) for which taxes have been executed. 
                  (f)  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal before the City Hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided, however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sale shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the City of Union City, makes any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied. 
                  (g)  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or a bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or a bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this article shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi fa or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy and sale. Recitals in the deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired. 
                  (h)  Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered a reasonable time, the marshal may either readvertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-7, § 6, 5-19-98) 
                  Sec. 13-9. - Bidding by city at tax sale; disposition of property acquired. 
                  (a)  If, during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county, and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city administrator, or his or her designee, may purchase the property for the City of Union City. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city administrator. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
                  (b)  Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder; however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in section 13-12 of this article. 
                  (c)  The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in a manner set forth in section 13-12 of this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-7, § 7, 5-19-98) 
                  Sec. 13-10. - Accounting by marshal; final return or settlement. 
                  (a)  The marshal shall make a prompt accounting to the city clerk for all executions placed in his hands for collection or levying for sale. He shall pay over to the clerk all amounts due the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties, and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with the disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs, and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess. 
                  (b)  In any event, within ninety (90) days from the date executions are placed in his hands, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he shall so notify the city clerk in writing. It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause cancellation of executions on the General Execution Docket of the county upon their final payment or collection. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-7, § 8, 5-19-98) 
                  Sec. 13-11. - Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment. 
                  (a)  Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi fa on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city clerk, in the name of the City of Union City, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he or she believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi fa or who has property, money, or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi fa. The clerk shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed.

                  (d)  General provisions. 
                  (1)  Severability.

In order for the municipality to properly impose such excise tax the municipality must follow all of the provisions of O.C.G.A. Title 48, Ch. 13, Art. 6, one (1) provision of which is the enactment of this article.

                  (e)  Removal of vehicle. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove any such illegally parked vehicle from the place where the same was illegally parked, except to report to the office of the station sergeant in compliance with such notice.

All of the signs shall be erected in accordance with the laws and regulations of the state governing stop signs, and according to the ordinances of the city in the absence of such state laws and regulations. 
                  (d)  When a stop sign is imbedded in the street or posted alongside such street it shall not be located more than ten (10) feet nor less than five (5) feet from such intersection nor more than eight (8) feet nor less than one (1) foot from the street alongside which such sign is located.

If the meter is located on a private right-of-way, the developer or owner of the property to which water service is provided by Union City must cause a master water meter to be installed on a public right-of-way. Upon installation of said master water meter, the City of Union City will read the master water meter and transmit a bill to the appropriate party, based on the reading of the master water meter. 
                  (Code 1976, § 12-104; Ord. No. 81-1, § 2, 2-17-81; Ord. No. 2003-03, § 2, 3-18-03; Ord. No. 2009-06, § 1, 4-21-09) 
                  Sec. 15-20. - Water bills. 
                  (a)  Due. All water service bills shall be paid each month on or before the due date printed on the customer's bill for water service. 
                  (b)  Notice of overdue payment. When bills for water service are not paid when due, water service will be scheduled for disconnection five (5) days subsequent to the due date printed on the customer's bill for water service. 
                  (c)  Water bill disputes. A customer may dispute the amount of any water bill by filing an application in person at city hall for review by the city administrator. Upon filing of said application, the city administrator shall make a determination as to the merit of the dispute and shall inform the customer of the determination within five (5) days of receiving the application. A customer may appeal the city administrator's determination to the mayor and city council by filing an application for appeal in person at city hall within five (5) days of the receipt by the customer of said determination. The appeal will be heard by the mayor and council at its next regularly scheduled meeting or work session, whichever is next to occur. The mayor and council will consider the appeal and rule accordingly. The decision of the mayor and council will be the final decision. 
                  (d)  Discontinuing service. 
                  (1)  Individual meters. Where a customer is provided service through an individual water meter as opposed to a master meter or shared meter, the city shall cause the water service of any customer not paying his or her bill five (5) days subsequent to the due date printed on the customer's bill for water service, to be discontinued. Service shall not be resumed until all delinquent bills and additional charges accrued, as provided hereinafter, have been paid in full. 
                  (2)  Master meters or shared meters. In those situations in which two (2) or more residences or tenants are served by a master meter or a shared meter and where the entity responsible for making payment to the city has not paid the bill within five (5) days of the due date printed on the bill for water services, the city shall notify said entity of its intention to discontinue water service, the city shall notify said entity of its intention to discontinue water service to the meter if payment is not made within five (5) days of receipt of the notification. If payment is not made within five (5) days of the entity's receipt of the notification, the city will notify all residences or tenants served by the master meter or shared meter of its intention to discontinue water service. If payment is not made within five (5) days of notification to the residences or tenants, the city shall cause the water service to be discontinued. Service shall not be resumed until all delinquent bills and additional charges accrued, as provided hereinafter, have been paid in full. 
                  (3)  Combination of individual/master or meters. Where water service is provided through a combination of individual and master or shared meters, the procedures used for discontinuing service for nonpayment of the bill for water service shall be determined on a case by case basis. 
                  (4)  Discontinuance of service where bill is in dispute. Regardless of the type of meter used, if the customer has filed an application to dispute his or her water bill with the city administrator, there shall be no disconnection of service pending the city administrator's determination as to the merit of the dispute. If the city administrator determines that the dispute is without merit, the customer's service shall be disconnected if the customer does not appeal the city administrator's determination to the mayor and city council within the time specified in subsection (c) above. If the customer appeals the decision within the specified time, there shall be no disconnection of service pending a hearing before the mayor and city council. However, if such delinquent customer fails to attend a scheduled hearing before the mayor and city council, the utility service shall be terminated as scheduled. 
                  (5)  Service sharges. Every bill not paid by the due date printed on the customer's bill for water service shall be assessed a thirty dollar-service charge. 
                  (e)  Reconnecting service. Water service will be reconnected upon payment of an amount equal to the amount of the bill for which the service was cut off plus ten (10) percent of that amount. 
                  (f)  Timing. For the purpose of this section, if the final day of any time period falls on a weekend or holiday, the time period will be extended to the next business day.

                  Each commercial applicant shall make a minimum deposit of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) at the time service is applied for. After the first three (3) full months of service, that deposit shall be adjusted to the average monthly bill in order that the adjusted deposit should be equivalent to the charge for two (2) months' service, but in no event shall the deposit be less than the one hundred twenty-five dollar ($125.00) minimum. Adjustments will be billed to the commercial customer. 
                  (b)  Water meter installation charges. The following fees shall be charged for the installation of water meters. All water meters are the property of the city:

                  (2)  Testing. Furnish and use appropriate test equipment and methods. Include gage, meter, pump and connections. Bleed all air from system prior to testing, providing any necessary corporation stops and piping installations. Pressure test all elements of the piping system. Where piping is buried or otherwise concealed, maintain the pressure test for not less than six (6) hours. Visible piping may be tested for a lesser time period, if approved by the city. Conduct pressure testing at two hundred (200) psig unless a lower pressure is recommended by a manufacturer of an element of the system. When a manufacturer does recommend a lower test pressure, furnish the engineer with a detailed written explanation before commencing test work. In no event may the lower test pressure be less than one hundred ten (110) percent of the nominal working pressure of the pipe comprising the system. Measure pressure for testing referred to the elevational datum of the lowest pipe of the line section being tested. Where possible, use methods and perform construction work in such sequence as necessary to accomplish pressure testing as work progresses. Do not pressure test more than a one (1) mile length of pipe at one (1) time. Provide temporary piping and accessories if required to isolate test sections. Makeup water, required to maintain test pressure in gallons per hour per one thousand (1,000) feet of pipe under test, over the test period may not exceed the quantities shown in the following table: 

                   
                  Repair all breaks, detectable leaks or other defects and retest as many times as necessary to obtain passing test. 
                  (m)  Disinfecting. Chlorinate all potable waterlines on completion of construction, after flushing and prior to placing in service. Use precaution to prevent backflow to supply system. Fill lines with potable water containing sufficient chlorine to show a twenty-five (25) ppm minimum residual at the end of the twenty-four-hour retention period, (fifty-ppm minimum applied). Locate application point at beginning of pipeline extension and apply chlorine by means of a solution feed device. Operate all valves and hydrants while filling the pipeline with chlorinating agent. Draw off at taps and hydrants along the line until an ortho-tolidine test shows a strong indication of residual chlorine. Retain chlorinated water in the system for a period of twenty-four (24) hours. Test for twenty-five-ppm residual. If residual is twenty-five (25) ppm or greater flush the system with potable water, otherwise repeat entire procedure until satisfactory results are obtained. Demonstrate lines to be free of contamination by drawing samples therefrom on two (2) successive days in the presence of the engineer. Deliver samples to the city for forwarding to a qualified laboratory for examination. On receipt of satisfactory test report from the foregoing laboratory, and with the approval of the city, the lines so tested are to be considered free of contamination and placed in service. In the event contamination persists, resterilize as necessary until receipt of satisfactory test report. 
                  (n)  Final acceptance by the city. The owner/developer shall before final acceptance present to the city the following:

                  2.  In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the city water system, the city system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system that have been subject to deterioration in quality. 
                  3.  In the case of premises having (1) internal cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impractical or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the city water system shall be protected against backflow from the premise by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line. 
                  d.  The type of protective assembly required under subsections C.2.c.(1), C.2.c.(2), and C.2.c.(3) shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows: 
                  1.  In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection C.2.c.(1) of this section and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the city water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly. 
                  2.  In case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the city water system, the city water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly. 
                  3.  In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the city water system, the city water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants. 
                  4.  In the case of any premises where there are "uncontrolled" cross connections, either actual or potential, the city water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly at the service connection. 
                  5.  In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the city water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly on each service to the premises. 
                  6.  In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the city administrator, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances, the city administrator may require an air-gap at the service connection to protect the city water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the city administrator and is dependent on the degree of hazard. 
                  e.  Any backflow-prevention assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the city engineer. The term approved backflow-prevention assembly shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) titled: 
                  AWWA C510, latest edition—Standard for Double Check Valve Backflow-Prevention Assembly, and 
                  AWWA C511, latest edition—Standard for Reduced-Pressure Principle Backflow-Prevention Assembly, and have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research (FCCHR) of the University of Southern California established by 
                  "Specification of Backflow-Prevention Assemblies"—Sec. 10 of the most current issue of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control. 
                  Said AWWA and FCCHR standards and specifications have been adopted by the city engineer. Final approval shall be evidenced by a "Certificate of Approval" issued by an approved testing laboratory certifying full compliance with said AWWA standards and FCCHR specifications. 
                  Backflow preventers that may be subjected to backpressure or backsiphonage that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by a qualified laboratory and are listed on the laboratory's current list of approved backflow-prevention assemblies may be used without further testing or qualification. 
                  f.  It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow-prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the city administrator deems the hazard to be great enough, certified inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by the assembly manufacturer's representative, public works department personnel, or by a certified tester approved by the city administrator. It shall be the duty of the city administrator to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The customer-user shall notify the city administrator in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that the city administrator may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept and made available to the city administrator. 
                  g.  All presently installed backflow-prevention assemblies that do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection D.2.f, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the city administrator is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location, requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the city administrator finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow-prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.

                  (g)  Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. 
                  (h)  When required by the superintendent, the owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the waters. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located, and it shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the superintendent. The manhole shall be installed and maintained by the owner at his expense, and he shall maintain the same so that the manhole shall be safe and accessible at all times. 
                  (i)  All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in subsections (f) and (h) above shall be determined in accordance with Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage, at the control manhole provided in subsection (h) above, or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
                  (j)  No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern.

                  (c)  While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in subsection (a) above the building inspector or duly authorized employees of the city shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to the city employees and the city shall indemnify the company against the loss or damage to its property by city employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the company and growing out of the gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions as required by this article. 
                  (d)  The building inspector and other duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which the city holds a duly negotiated easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying within said easement.

                  Sec. 15-207. - Executions on delinquent fees. 
                  (a)  As soon as the due date for the payment of fees has arrived, the city clerk shall notify the customer and/or property owner, in writing, of the fact that the fees have not been paid and that an execution shall be issued, unless payment is received within thirty (30) days. 
                  (b)  If payment for past due fees has not been received within thirty (30) days of the written notification to the customer and/or the property owner, the mayor and council shall by resolution, declare the fees delinquent and authorize the city utilities clerk to issue an execution against the property of the customer and/or property owner. 
                  (c)  The city utilities clerk shall issue an execution for the nonpayment of fees after the resolution of the mayor and council authorizing said execution as provided in subsection (b) above.

Execution shall be directed to "all and singular sheriffs and constables of the state." 
                  (d)  The city utilities clerk shall cause all executions issued to be recorded on the general execution docket of the county where the property is located, in the case of real property, and, in the case of personal property, in any county of the customer and/or property owner's residence if a resident of Georgia, otherwise in the county where real or personal property of the customer and/or property owner may be found. If the customer and/or the property owner is not a resident of Georgia and has no known real or personal property within Georgia, the execution shall be recorded in the county in which the act or activity giving rise to the fee liability occurred. 
                  (e)  All executions issued shall bear interest and penalties at the rates established in this ordinance for past due fees. 
                  (f)  The city utilities clerk shall cause all executions issued to be placed in the hands of the city marshal for collection or levy and sale of property. The marshal shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of fees due, together with all interest, penalties, and costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi, fa. In the event he is unable to do so, the marshal shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of property belonging to the defendant in fi. fa., whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due upon a sale of said property to be held and conducted in accordance with this ordinance. 
                  (Ord. No. 2003-01, § 4, 2-18-03) 
                  Sec. 15-208. - Levy of executions; sale of property. 
                  (a)  The director of the department of public safety is hereby designated as the marshal of the City of Union City and delegated the duties set forth in this ordinance. The marshal shall account for all money in his possession where the source of said money is the public sale of property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. The marshal shall first pay the city clerk the amount due on the process under which the sale was made. Any surplus shall be paid by the marshal to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for fees. If no such claimant comes forth, the surplus shall be paid to the defendant in fi. fa. 
                  (b)  Prior to any levy on real property, five (5) days written notice of the levy must be given personally or delivered by certified mail to the defendant in fi. fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall be conspicuously posted on the land in addition to the notice given directly to the defendant in fi. fa. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest held by the defendant in fi. fa. therein. 
                  (c)  Whenever any real property is levied upon for fees or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty to give twenty (20) days written notice of the levy to the customer and/or record owner(s) of the property and the holder of each security deed of record, before proceeding to advertise the property for sale. The twenty-day period shall begin to run from the time that the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the customer and/or owner of the land, the period for which the fees were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the fees due, including costs accrued thereon. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date and manner of notice delivery or mailing, and the place and party to which the notice was delivered or mailed. The marshal shall file the copy with the city clerk. 
                  (d)  When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner provided as that for executions and judicial sales; however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi. fa. shall be given at least ten (10) days written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the customer and/or property owner at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or a lien on the property subject to the property's sale and such claim or lien was filed or recorded more than thirty (30) days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his delegate not less than twenty-five (25) days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service, or by registered mail or by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
                  (e)  For four (4) weeks, in the official legal organ of the city, the marshal shall publish a weekly advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted. This advertisement shall also include a full and complete description of the property to be sold, and the known names of the customers and/or owners of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state that the property is being sold for collection of fees due to the City of Union City and the period of time for which said fees accrued which gave rise to the execution for satisfaction. 
                  (f)  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal, before the county courthouse, on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash. However, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sale shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. As to the title and soundness of all property sold under fee executions, the purchaser bears all risks. Neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the City of Union City, makes any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, express or implied. 
                  (g)  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sale price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who purchases any property sold at said sale shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money regardless of purchaser failure or refusal to comply with the terms of sale upon request by the marshal. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. Upon a sale for fees conducted pursuant to this ordinance, the deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered by the marshal shall convey title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of property shall be final. Recitals in the deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property sold pursuant to this ordinance. 
                  (h)  If, after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no bids are forthcoming on property sold for fees, the marshal may either readvertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and held out for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids.

                  Sec. 15-209. - Bidding by city at sale, disposition of property acquired. 
                  (a)  If, after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale of property for fees makes a bid for the property being sold that is high enough to equal or exceed the total of fees due plus the marshal's cost of the sale, then the city administrator, or his or her designee, may purchase the property for the City of Union City. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city administrator. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
                  (b)  Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for fees may be divested or alienated by the city only pursuant to a public sale of the property to the highest bidder.

                  Sec. 15-210. - Accounting by marshal; final return or settlement. 
                  (a)  The Marshal shall make a prompt accounting of all property placed in his possession due to an execution for collection or levying for sale to the city clerk. He shall pay over to the clerk all amounts due the city for fees, interest, penalties, and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid and the final disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying fees, costs, and expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized by this ordinance to receive the excess. 
                  (b)  If, within ninety (90) days from the date an execution is placed in his possession, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he shall so notify the city utilities clerk in writing. It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause cancellation of the execution on the general execution docket of the county at the time of final payment or collection upon said execution.

                  Sec. 15-211. - Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment. 
                  (a)  Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi. fa. on which to levy any fee execution in his possession, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city utilities clerk, in the name of the City of Union City, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he or she believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi. fa. or who has property, money, or effects in his possession belonging to the defendant in fi. fa. The clerk shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued. 
                  (b)  When an execution for fees remains unsatisfied and an entry of "nulla bona" has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately proceeding thirty (30) day period and the city utilities clerk has reason to believe the defendant in fi. fa. may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state of Georgia, the city utilities clerk, in the name of the City of Union City, may petition the Superior Court of the county in Georgia in which the defendant in fi. fa. maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi. fa. does not maintain a known residence in Georgia, the action may be brought in the county where the fee obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.

                  Sec. 15-212. - Costs. 
                  (a)  For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the clerk of Superior Court for recording plus the cancellation fee of the fi. fa. 
                  (b)  In addition to the levy administration fee, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property. 
                  (c)  The costs provided in this section shall be cumulative and in addition to any other statutory premiums allowed.

                  ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

                  Sec. 15-300. - Short title. 
                  This article will be known as the "Union City Stormwater Utility Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. No. 2012-10, § 1, 6-19-12) 
                  Sec. 15-301. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the establishment of a stormwater utility in the City of Union City. The objectives of this article are stated as follows: 
                  (1)  The professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the mayor and council properly assess and define the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the city. 
                  (2)  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city, it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of a separate accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city. 
                  (3)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city. Intense urban development in the city has radically altered the natural hydrology of the area and the hydraulics of stormwater systems, with many natural elements having been replaced or augmented by man-made facilities. As a result, the specific service, system and facility demands in the city now exceed the service capability of many of the systems. An advanced level of service is needed in the city due to its urbanization, therefore a stormwater utility service area subject to stormwater service charges should encompass the entirety of the city to enable the city to successfully manage, operate and improve stormwater systems at an advanced level. 
                  (4)  It is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater service level continue to be funded from the city's general tax revenues, and therefore that the mayor and council may allocate general fund support to stormwater management in the future in the form of a combination of service charge payments for city-owned properties and a supplemental allocation of general fund funding. 
                  (5)  The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Funding of stormwater services and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the city in protecting the public health, safety and welfare. 
                  (6)  Provision of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses, and the service and benefits differ among the individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems. 
                  (7)  The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater programs, systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is not practical to allocate the cost of the city's stormwater management programs, systems and facilities in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time, but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the long-term demands they impose on the city's stormwater programs, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits. 
                  (8)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater systems and facilities in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
                  (9)  The mayor and council find, conclude and determine that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and benefits throughout the city, and the most equitable means to fund an advanced level of stormwater services in the city through stormwater service charges and other mechanisms as described in the professional engineering and financial analyses prepared for the city. 
                  (b)  Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the corporate area of Union City. 
                  (c)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (d)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
                  (e)  Responsibility for administration. The city manager shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 15-302. - Establishment of a utility and an enterprise fund. 
                  (a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility which shall be responsible for stormwater management programs throughout the city, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. The stormwater utility management unit shall be composed of such personnel, employees and agents of the city as the mayor and council may from time to time determine and their compensation shall be fixed and determined by the city manager as approved by the mayor and council. 
                  (b)  A stormwater enterprise fund shall be established in the city budget and accounting system for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees and licenses as may be established by the mayor and council and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the stormwater utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater enterprise fund and all expenses of the utility shall be paid from the stormwater enterprise fund, except that other revenues receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management programs, facilities, operations and capital investments as deemed appropriate by the mayor and council, upon recommendation by the city manager. 
                  (c)  The mayor and council hereby confer upon the stormwater utility operational control over the existing stormwater management programs, systems and facilities performed, provided or owned and heretofore operated by the city and other related assets, including but not limited to properties other than roadways upon which such systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management.

                  [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
                  Customers of the stormwater utility. Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties and entities served by and/or benefitting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, regulation and improvement of the stormwater management programs, systems and facilities and regulation of public and private stormwater systems, facilities and activities related thereto, and persons, properties and entities which will ultimately be served or benefitted as a result of the stormwater management program. 
                  Hydrologic response. The hydrologic response of a property is the manner whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including but not limited to the presence of impervious area, the size, shape, topographic, vegetative and geologic conditions of a property, antecedent moisture conditions and groundwater conditions on a property. 
                  Impervious surfaces. Impervious surfaces are those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, paved areas and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development or other imposition of impervious surfaces. 
                  Stormwater management systems and facilities. Stormwater management systems and facilities are those natural and man-made channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, area drains, drop inlets, junction boxes, pipes, head walls, flared end sections, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
                  Undeveloped land. Land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state.

                  (a)  The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvement of those stormwater systems and facilities which: 
                  (1)  Are located within public streets, rights-of-way and easements; 
                  (2)  Are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or 
                  (3)  Are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of systems and facilities. 
                  (b)  Operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the city and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. 
                  (c)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of all properties and persons in general by regulation of the stormwater system and facilities, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. 
                  (d)  To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation, or rule of the city or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees or agents.

                  Sec. 15-305. - Requirements for on-site stormwater systems: Enforcement methods and inspections. 
                  (a)  All property owners and developers of real property to be developed within the city shall provide, manage, maintain and operate on-site stormwater systems and facilities sufficient to collect, convey, detain, control and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all city development regulations and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the city in the municipal court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof charged to the owner in the same manner as a stormwater service charge. 
                  (b)  In the event that the city shall file an action pursuant to subsection (a), from the date of filing such action the city shall have lien rights in relation to any service charge assessed against the property in the same manner as a tax levied against the property, which rights may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. In addition, the city shall have the right to pursue collection of the service charge through other legal action or judgment. 
                  (c)  The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private property and public property owned by other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with any order or judgment entered pursuant to this section.

                  Sec. 15-306. - General funding policy. 
                  (a)  It shall be the policy of the city that funding for the stormwater utility program, systems and facilities shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater program, systems and facilities by individual properties or persons and/or the level of service rendered by or resulting from the provision of stormwater programs, systems and facilities. Stormwater service charge rates shall be structured so as to be fair and reasonable, and the resultant service charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rentals, rates, charges, fees or licenses. Service charge rates shall be structured to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management within the city, including but not limited to, general tax revenues allocated to stormwater management, plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in-lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges and special assessments. 
                  (b)  The cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities may include operating, capital investment and reserve expenses, and may consider stormwater quality as well as stormwater quantity management problems, needs and requirements. 
                  (c)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service charges and/or other methods of funding stormwater management shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater systems or facilities or to private stormwater facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater systems or facilities. 
                  (d)  Stormwater utility service charge rates, fees and other similar charges shall be established by the mayor and council.

                  ARTICLE VII. - STORMWATER UTILITY RATES 

                  Sec. 15-326. - Short title. 
                  This article will be known as the "Union City Stormwater Utility Rates Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. No. 2012-11, § 1, 6-19-12) 
                  Sec. 15-327. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the establishment of stormwater utility rates in the City of Union City. The objectives of this article are stated as follows: 
                  (1)  The professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and considered to the mayor and council properly assess, define and project the cost of stormwater management systems and facilities of the city. 
                  (2)  Given the projected cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city, it is appropriate to adopt a stormwater service fee rate methodology and to charge service fees to properties and persons within the city in a manner that recovers the cost of programs, systems and facilities and other costs associated therewith, including but not limited to allocations of the cost of services provided to the stormwater management utility by other funds of the city and other government entities and agencies, interest on bonds, operational and emergency reserves, allowances for delinquencies and bad debt, and such other costs as may be deemed reasonable and appropriate by the mayor and council of the city to ensure the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater programs, systems and facilities in the city. 
                  (3)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city and the stormwater service fee rate methodology and service fees should be applicable throughout the city to enable the city to successfully manage, operate and improve stormwater programs, systems and facilities at an advanced level. 
                  (4)  It is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater service level continue to be funded from the city's general tax revenues, and therefore that the mayor and council may allocate general fund support to stormwater management in the future in the form of a combination of service charge payments for city-owned properties and a supplemental allocation of general fund funding. 
                  (5)  The stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Funding of stormwater services and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the city in protecting the public health, safety and welfare. 
                  (6)  Provision of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses, and the service and benefits differ among the individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems. 
                  (7)  The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater programs, systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is not practical to allocate the cost of the city's stormwater management programs, systems and facilities in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time, but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the long-term demands they impose on the city's stormwater programs, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits. 
                  (8)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater systems and facilities in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
                  (b)  Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the corporate area of Union City. 
                  (c)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (d)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
                  (e)  Responsibility for administration. The city manager shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 15-328. - Definitions. 
                  [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
                  Credits. Credit shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service fee or other fees, rates, rentals, charges, fines and penalties to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility, or continuing provision of a service or activity that reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities. 
                  Developed land. Developed land shall mean property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than two hundred (200) square feet of impervious surfaces as defined in this chapter. 
                  Duplexes and triplexes. Duplexes and triplexes shall mean developed land containing two (2) (duplex) or three (3) (triplex) residential dwelling units located within the same building on one (1) or more parcels of land. 
                  Equivalent residential unit. For the purposes of this article, an equivalent residential unit shall mean 2.80 thousand (2,800) square feet of impervious surfaces for other than special developed lands. For special developed lands, the equivalent residential unit shall mean 6.50 thousand (6,500) square feet of impervious surfaces. The equivalent residential unit shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater service fees to single-family dwelling unit properties or classes of single-family dwelling unit properties, other developed lands, and special developed lands. 
                  Multiple-family dwelling unit residential properties. Multiple-family dwelling unit residential properties shall mean developed land whereon more than one (1) residential dwelling unit is located, and shall include, but not be limited to, apartment houses, structures containing multiple residential condominiums located on a single parcel of property, boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, personal care homes, homes for the elderly, retirement and nursing homes, and other structures in which more than one (1) family group commonly and normally reside or could reside. For the application of stormwater service fees, multiple-family dwelling unit residential properties shall be treated in the same manner as are other developed lands as defined in this article. 
                  Other developed lands. Other developed lands shall mean, but not be limited to, multiple-family dwelling unit residential unit properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial, retail and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, railroad stations and other transportation facilities covered by impervious surfaces, parking lots and decks, parks and other recreational properties, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, and water and wastewater treatment plants and all other types of developed land except single-family dwelling units. 
                  Single-family dwelling unit. Single-family dwelling unit shall mean developed land upon which is located one (1) principal structure that contains one (1) dwelling unit designed for occupancy by one (1) family, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities. Single-family dwelling units may include houses, duplexes, triplexes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located on one (1) or more individual lots or parcels of land, and fee-simple ownership or condominium townhomes and attached single-family residential structures located on individual lots or parcels of land and such single units located on more than one (1) individual lot or parcel of land. For the purposes of this article, developed land may be classified as a single-family dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental and/or accessory structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports or small storage buildings, accessory dwellings or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional areas of impervious surfaces such as parking spaces, playgrounds or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship or similar nonresidential uses. Single-family dwelling units shall not include developed land containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple-family residential units that are individually owned but are located on a single parcel of developed land, such as condominiums and cooperatively-owned apartments. 
                  Special developed lands . Special developed lands shall mean all single-parcel developments which contain in excess of four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet of impervious surfaces. 
                  Stormwater service fees. Stormwater service fees shall mean the periodic service fee imposed pursuant to this article by the city for the purpose of recovering and/or funding costs related to stormwater management systems and facilities. The use of the area of impervious surface on each property as a measure to determine the stormwater service fee rate shall not preclude the use of other measures, or of grouping of properties having similar characteristics into classes or categories, grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one (1) or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the city's cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service fees may also include certain special charges to individual properties or persons for stormwater management systems and facilities or services related to stormwater management, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced levels of stormwater service above and beyond the service levels normally provided by city. 
                  (Ord. No. 2012-11, § 1, 6-19-12; Ord. No. 2016-05, §§ 1, 2, 9-20-16) 
                  Sec. 15-329. - Stormwater service fee rates. 
                  Stormwater service fee rates may be determined and modified from time to time by the mayor and council of the city so that the total revenue generated by said fees and any other sources of revenues or other resources allocated to stormwater management by the mayor and council shall be sufficient to meet the cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities, including but not limited to the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, operating expense, capital outlays, non-operating expense, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the mayor and council of the city. 
                  Stormwater service fee revenues in any given year may exceed or be less than the cost of service in that year, provided, however, that the stormwater service fee rate shall be based on meeting the long-term projected cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities. All unencumbered stormwater management funds derived from service fees and other sources of revenue not expended at the end of a fiscal year shall remain in the stormwater management utility enterprise fund account and balances shall be forwarded to the next fiscal year. The stormwater service fee rates are as follows: 
                  (1)  Single-family dwelling units . Single-family dwelling units, as defined by this article, shall be billed for one equivalent residential unit, as defined in this article. 
                  (2)  Other developed lands . All developed lands not classified as single-family dwelling units or special developed lands, as defined by this article, shall be billed for one (1) equivalent residential unit, as defined by this article, for each 2.80 thousand (2,800) square feet of impervious surfaces or partial increment thereof located on the property. 
                  (3)  Special developed lands . All special developed lands, as defined in this article, shall be billed for one (1) equivalent residential unit, as defined in this article, for each 6.50 thousand (6,500) square feet of impervious surfaces or partial increment thereof located on the property. 
                  The stormwater service charge rate per equivalent residential unit, as defined in this article, shall be four dollars ($4.00) per month. 
                  (Ord. No. 2012-11, § 1, 6-19-12; Ord. No. 2016-05, § 3, 9-20-16) 
                  Sec. 15-330. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service fees. 
                  Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater utility service fees or receive a credit or offset against such service fees. No exemption, credit, offset or other reduction in stormwater service fees shall be granted based on the age, tax, or economic status, race or religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities. A stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions shall be prepared by the city engineer and approved by the mayor and council specifying the design and performance standards of on-site stormwater systems, facilities and activities that qualify for application of a service fee credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. 
                  (1)  Properties that are not defined in this article as being developed land shall be exempt from stormwater service fees. 
                  (2)  Railroad tracks; gravel and stone areas underneath and immediately adjacent to the tracks; and undeveloped portions of the railroad right of way shall be exempt from stormwater service fees. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, paved or unpaved service roads and drives, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service fees. 
                  (3)  Developed land than other single-family dwelling units, including, but not limited to, multiple-family dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial, retail and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks and other recreational properties, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, and water and wastewater treatment plants and all other types of developed land except single-family dwelling units may receive a credit against the stormwater service fee applicable to the property. The stormwater utility service fee credit for on-site stormwater control systems or facilities that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces on the subject property shall be proportional to the extent that the on-site stormwater control systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner meets or exceeds the city's development and performance standards contained in the stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions and other requirements and conditions. The amount of the stormwater utility service fee credit shall not be related to the cost incurred by the property owner for performing, constructing, providing and/or maintaining such programs, systems, facilities, services and activities. 
                  (4)  Groups of single-family dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association that owns, operates and maintains on-site stormwater control systems or facilities, or that provides services or activities that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces located on the subject properties may receive a credit against the stormwater service fee applicable to the properties represented by the homeowner's association. Such service fee credit shall be based on attaining and continuing compliance with the technical requirements and performance standards contained in the stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions and other requirements and conditions. The stormwater utility service fee credit for on-site stormwater control systems or facilities, or for services or activities provided by groups of single-family dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association shall be proportional to the extent that the on-site stormwater control systems or facilities provided, operated and maintained by the homeowner's association meets or exceeds the city's development and performance standards contained in the stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions and other requirements and conditions. Such credits shall be proportionately allocated among all properties presented by the incorporated homeowner's association. The stormwater utility service fee credit for services and activities that reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management systems and facilities shall not be related to the cost of such services and activities to the homeowner's association or any person or entity providing same. 
                  (5)  Individual single-family dwelling units required by the city to install on-site detention or that provide services or activities that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces located on the subject properties may receive a credit against the stormwater service fee applicable to the subject property. Such service fee credit shall be based on attaining and continuing compliance with the technical requirements and performance standards contained in the stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions and other requirements and conditions. The stormwater utility service fee credit for on-site stormwater control systems or facilities, or for services or activities provided by individual single-family dwelling units shall be a fixed amount and shall be subject to the requirement that the on-site stormwater control systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner meet the city's development standards and performance standards contained in the stormwater utility service fee credit application and instructions and other requirements and conditions. The stormwater utility service fee credit for services, facilities and activities shall not be related to the cost of such services and activities to the homeowner or any person or entity providing same. 
                  (Ord. No. 2012-11, § 1, 6-19-12) 
                  Sec. 15-331. - Stormwater service fee billing, delinquencies, and collections. 
                  A stormwater service fee bill may be sent though the United States mail or by alternative means, notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. The stormwater service fee bill may be billed and collected along with other fees and charges, including but not limited to, other utility bills, assessments or property taxes, as deemed most effective and efficient by the city manager. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fees and other charges and any associated fines or penalties, including but not limited to, interest on delinquent service fees. If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may back bill for a period of up to one (1) year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency during that back billed period. A late charge of five (5) percent of the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility service fee bill shall be charged when a bill becomes delinquent. Thereafter, an additional charge of one (1) percent based on the unpaid bill and any applicable delinquency charge shall be charged for each month the bill remains delinquent. 
                  (1)  Stormwater service fee bills for commercial or multiple residential condominium properties may be delivered to the individual condominium owners apportioning the stormwater service fee for the entire property equally among all properties.

                  Sec. 15-332. - Appeals. 
                  Any customer who believes the provisions of this article have been applied in error may appeal in the following manner and sequence. 
                  (1)  An appeal must be filed in writing with the city manager or her/his designated representative. In the case of stormwater service fee appeals, the appeal shall include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer containing information on the total property area, the impervious surface area, and any other features or conditions that influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events. 
                  (2)  Using information provided by the appellant, the city manager shall conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond to the appeal in writing within sixty (60) days. In response to an appeal, the city manager may adjust the stormwater service fee applicable to any property in conformance with the general purposes and intent of this article. 
                  (3)  All decisions by the city manager shall be served on the appellant personally or by registered or certified mail, sent to the billing address of the appellant. All decisions of the city manager shall be final. 
                  (4)  Any person aggrieved by a decision or order of the city, after exhausting his/her administrative remedies, shall have a right to appeal de novo to the Superior Court of Fulton County.
