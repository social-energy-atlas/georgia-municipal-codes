PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Alto, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Index 
                  The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments

                  Secs. 23-1—23-20. - Reserved. 
                  ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 

                  Sec. 23-21. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
                  (a)  Authorization. Article IX, section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and town council of Alto, Georgia, does ordain as set out in the following subsections. 
                  (b)  Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of Alto, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (d)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
                  (4)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  Insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
                  (Ord. of 6-13-2006, art. 1) 
                  Sec. 23-22. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Alto, Georgia. 
                  (b)  Basis for area of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated June 13, 2006, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. 
                  For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS for Habersham County dated April 2, 1991, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto are hereby adopted by reference. 
                  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. See also town street map of floodprone areas. 
                  The repository for public inspection of the Flood Insurance Study (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting data is located in the Alto City Hall. 
                  (c)  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
                  (d)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
                  (e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
                  (f)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be: 
                  (1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
                  (2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
                  (3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
                  (g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of Town of Alto or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
                  (h)  Penalties for violation. Failure to comply with the provisions of this article or with any of its requirements, including conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a violation. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1000.00 or imprisoned for not more than 90 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Town of Alto from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

                  Sec. 23-24. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
                  (a)  General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area. 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 23-24(a)(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 23-23(c)(6) of this article. 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved: (i) on individual lots or parcels; (ii) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection (a)(6) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a. through c. above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 23-22(b) of this article, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. 
                  Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section. 
                  (c)  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 23-22(b) of this article, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), OR where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with subsection 23-22(b) of this article, then the Town of Alto building inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this section. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) [below] shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (a)(4) of this section, "Elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The Town of Alto building inspector shall review and record the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (d)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO-zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 23-22(b) of this article, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (a)(4) of this section, "Elevated buildings". 
                  The Town of Alto building inspector shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 23-23(b)(1) and (2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  (e)  Standards for subdivisions. 
                  (1)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (2)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  (3)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
                  (4)  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or Conditional Letter of Map Amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR. 
                  (f)  Standards for critical facilities. 
                  (1)  Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain. 
                  (2)  All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation. 
                  (Ord. of 6-13-2006, art. 4) 
                  Sec. 23-25. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The board of zoning and appeals as established by mayor and town council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Town of Alto building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of zoning and appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Banks or Habersham County, Georgia, as provided in the O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of zoning and appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The Town of Alto building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of zoning and appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
                  (Ord. of 6-13-2006, art. 5) 
                  Sec. 23-26. - Definitions. 
                  Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application.

                  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and permanent storage of materials or equipment. 
                  Elevated building means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before June 13, 2006 [i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management code or ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for that community's participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)]. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before June 13, 2006 [i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
                  (2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Flood insurance study (FIS) is the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
                  (1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

                  a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after June 13, 2006, and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure [i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for community participation in the (NFIP)]. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after June 13, 2006. [i.e. the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) as corrected in 1988 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis;

                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals, or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or other improvements to a structure, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. (Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.) This term includes structures, which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
                  (1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
                  (2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (i)  Any retailer or retail consumption dealer, or any person acting on behalf of such retailer or retail consumption dealer, who upon requesting proper identification from a person attempting to purchase alcoholic beverages from such retailer or retail consumption dealer pursuant to subsection (h) of this Code section is tendered a driver's license which indicates that such driver's license is falsified, is not the driver's license of the person presenting it, or that such person is under the age of 21 years, the person to whom said license is tendered shall be authorized to either write down the name, address, and license number or to seize and retain such driver's license and in either event shall immediately thereafter summon a law enforcement officer who shall be authorized to seize the license either at the scene or at such time as the license can be located.

                  (d)  Material not otherwise obscene may be obscene under this article section if the distribution thereof, the offer to do so, or the possession with the intent to do so is a commercial exploitation of erotica solely for the sake of their prurient appeal.

                  ARTICLE II. - LANDFILL AND WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT 

                  Sec. 42-21. - Monthly assessment; restrictions. 
                  (a)  A monthly assessment in the amount as set by the town's fee schedule shall be applied to each residential water customer residing within the municipal limits of the town. The purpose of this assessment shall be to reimburse the town for the costs of waste and garbage pickup service and landfill fees incurred in the disposal of residential waste and garbage. Said surcharge shall be attached and assessed to each water bill on a monthly basis. In addition, if a residential water customer maintains more than one household or more than one residence for which water service is provided under one bill a charge as set by the town's fee schedule per household shall attach. 
                  (b)  The town shall provide waste and garbage pickup service for residents within the town limits. The following restrictions to waste and garbage pickups shall apply: 
                  (1)  Only normal household waste and garbage will be collected. 
                  (2)  All refuse must be properly bagged and contained. 
                  (3)  Residents will not include any yard materials, construction debris, asbestos, fuel, combustibles, or hazardous materials in the garbage or refuse to be collected by the town. 
                  (4)  Oversized objects, such as furniture, bedding, and oversized boxes will not be collected by the town and disposal of such items will be the sole responsibility of the individual who has accumulated such objects. 
                  (5)  The garbage and refuse to be collected shall be limited to such garbage and refuse as is generated by the household for whom the monthly assessment is paid. 
                  (6)  No resident will include garbage or refuse from households outside the municipal limits of the town. The penalties for violating this provision shall be as set forth in section 1-9.

                  Sec. 42-22. - Penalty for nonpayment. 
                  (a)  A charge as set by the town's fee schedule shall be added to each account that is over 30 days old. Said charge shall be added on monthly. If a resident fails and refuses to pay the charge outlined herein, garbage service will be discontinued to said resident until all amounts owed are paid in full. 
                  (b)  A security deposit paid by consumers when application for water service is made through the town shall serve as a security deposit for the landfill assessment fee. The town water ordinance was amended on the same date as the ordinance from which this section is derived to provide that said security deposit shall also secure the payment of landfill use fee. Upon discontinuation of water service, the security deposit shall be refunded to the consumer by the town provided that all amounts due for water service and landfill services are paid in full. In the event that any balances remaining under either bill, the security deposit shall be applied towards settlement of the account. If any balance remains after the security deposit is credited to the bill, the town may proceed to collect the balance and may use any means available by law to ensure collection, including the filing of suit.

                  Sec. 58-31. - Franchise to operate required. 
                  It shall be unlawful to operate a cable television system within the town unless a valid franchise has first been obtained from the franchising authority pursuant to the terms of this chapter. A franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall authorize the grantee to provide cable television services within the town and to charge subscribers for such services. It shall also authorize and permit the grantee to traverse any portion of the town in order to provide service outside the town. Unless otherwise specified, the franchise area shall be the legal boundaries of the town. 
                  (Ord. of 7-13-1993, § 3(3.1)) 
                  Sec. 58-32. - Application procedures and criteria. 
                  (a)  An application for a new cable television franchise shall be submitted to the franchising authority in a form specified by or acceptable to the town, and in accordance with procedures and schedules established by the franchising authority. The franchising authority may request such facts and information as it deems appropriate. 
                  (b)  Any applicant shall furnish to the franchising authority a map of suitable scale, showing all roads and public buildings, which indicates the areas to be served and the proposed dates of commencement of service for each area. The proposed service area shall be subject to approval by the franchising authority. If approved, the service area shall be incorporated into any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter. If no service area is specifically delineated in a franchise, it shall be considered to be coterminous with the boundaries of the town. 
                  (c)  After receiving an application for a franchise, the franchising authority shall examine the legal, financial, technical and character qualifications of the applicant. The franchising authority may grant one or more nonexclusive franchises creating a right to construct and operate a cable television system within the public ways of the town, subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (d)  In the event an application is filed proposing to serve a franchise area which overlaps, in whole or in part, an existing grantee's franchise area, a copy of such application shall be served by the applicant, by registered or certified mail, upon the existing grantee. Such notice shall be considered a condition precedent to consideration of the application by the franchising authority. 
                  (Ord. of 7-13-1993, § 3(3.2)) 
                  Sec. 58-33. - Competing or overlapping franchises. 
                  (a)  Any franchise granted by the franchising authority shall be nonexclusive. However, while the franchising authority may grant more than one franchise, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require it to grant more than one franchise if the franchising authority determines pursuant to the procedures established in this section that granting additional franchises would be detrimental to the public interest. 
                  (b)  If one or more competing or overlapping franchises are granted, the franchising authority shall not grant such a franchise on terms or conditions which are either more favorable or less burdensome than those granted under any existing franchise or ordinance. Any franchise which may be granted shall require the new grantee to provide cable service to the entire franchise area then served by the existing grantee. Moreover, an existing grantee may, at its discretion, comply with the most favorable terms contained in any subsequent franchise granted by the franchising authority. 
                  (c)  Since competing or overlapping franchises may have an adverse impact on the public rights-of-way, on the quality and availability of communications services to the public and may adversely affect the existing operator's ability to continue to provide the services and facilities it is presently providing under this chapter, the franchising authority may issue a franchise in an area where another grantee is operating only following a public hearing to consider the potential impact which the grant of an additional franchise may have on the community. In considering whether to grant one or more additional franchises, the franchising authority shall specifically consider, and address in a written report, the following issues: 
                  (1)  The positive and/or negative impact of an additional franchise on the community. 
                  (2)  The ability and willingness of an applicant to provide cable television service to the entire franchise area which is served by the existing cable operator. The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that any competition which may occur among grantees will be on equal terms and conditions so as not to give a competitive advantage to one grantee over another. 
                  (3)  The amount of time it will take the applicant to complete construction of the proposed system and activate service in the entire franchise area; and, whether the applicant can complete construction and activation of its system in a timely manner. 
                  (4)  The financial capabilities of the applicant and its guaranteed commitment to make the necessary investment to erect, maintain and operate the proposed cable TV system for the duration of the franchise term. In order to ensure that any prospective grantee does have the requisite current financial capabilities, the franchising authority may request equity and debt financing commitment letters, current financial statements, bonds, letters of credit or other documentation to demonstrate to the franchising authority's satisfaction that the requisite funds to construct and operate the proposed system are available. 
                  (5)  The quality and technical reliability of the proposed system, based upon the applicant's plan of construction and the method of distribution of signals, and the applicant's technical qualifications to construct and operate such system. 
                  (6)  The experience of the applicant in the erection, maintenance and operation of a cable television system. 
                  (7)  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate one or more additional cable systems and the potential disruption of those public rights-of-way and private property that may occur if one or more additional franchises are granted. 
                  (8)  The disruption of existing cable television service and the potential that the proposed franchise would adversely affect the residents of the town. 
                  (9)  The likelihood and ability of an applicant to continue to provide competing cable television service to subscribers within the entire franchise area for the duration of the franchise. 
                  (10)  Such other information as the franchising authority may deem appropriate to be considered prior to granting any competing or overlapping franchise.

                  Sec. 58-34. - Permits for nonfranchised entities. 
                  The franchising authority may issue a license, easement or other permit to a person other than the grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of the grantee's franchise area within the town in order to provide service outside, but not within the town. Such license or easement, absent a grant of a franchise in accordance with this chapter, shall not authorize nor permit said person to provide cable television service of any type to any home or place of business within the town nor render any other service within the town.

The grantee shall provide the franchising authority with notice of its intent to renew the franchise at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the then current term.

                  The grantee shall pay a franchise fee for the use of the town's rights-of-way and to compensate the town for all costs associated with administering and regulating the cable system. The amount of the franchise fee shall be five percent of the grantee's annual gross subscriber receipts, and such fee shall be paid on an annual basis. The grantee shall be entitled to list the franchise fee as a separate line item on monthly bills.

                  At the franchising authority's request, the grantee shall file a report showing grantee's gross subscriber receipts for the calendar year and the amount of franchise fees due to the town. Such reports may be requested once per calendar year. The grantee shall have an obligation to maintain financial records of its gross subscriber receipts and grantee fee payments for audit purposes for a period of three years, and the franchising authority shall have the right to audit the grantee's books at the offices where such books are maintained.

                  (a)  All charges to subscribers shall be consistent with a schedule of fees for services offered and established by the grantee. Rates shall be nondiscriminatory in nature and uniform to persons of like classes, under similar circumstances and conditions, except where necessary to meet competition. 
                  (b)  The grantee may offer different or discounted rates at its discretion in order to meet competition or for promotional purposes. The grantee may establish different rates for different classes of subscribers where appropriate, such as offering discounted rates to low income individuals or groups. 
                  (c)  The grantee shall inform each new subscriber of all applicable fees and charges for providing cable television service. 
                  (d)  The grantee may, at its own discretion and in a nondiscriminatory manner, waive, reduce or suspend connection fees, monthly service fees or other charges on a one time or monthly basis for promotional purposes. 
                  (e)  This section shall not prevent a grantee from refusing service to any person because the grantee's prior accounts with that person remain due and owing. 
                  (f)  A grantee may offer service which requires advance payment of periodic service charges. A customer shall have the right, at any time, to have service disconnected with a refund of any prepaid but unused service charges within 60 days from the date service is disconnected. 
                  (g)  The grantee will provide the town with 30 days' advance written notice of any change in rates and charges whenever possible. However, the grantee is entitled to set its rates and charges as it sees fit without obtaining the prior consent of the franchising authority. 
                  (h)  The grantee shall provide refunds to subscribers in the following cases: 
                  (1)  If the grantee fails within a reasonable time to commence service requested by a subscriber, it will refund all deposits or advance charges that the subscriber has paid in connection with the request for such service at the request of the subscriber. 
                  (2)  If a subscriber terminates any service at any time and has a credit balance, the grantee will, upon notice from the subscriber and upon return of all of grantee's equipment, refund the appropriate credit balance to the subscriber. The subscriber will be responsible for furnishing the grantee a proper address to which to mail the refund. 
                  (3)  If any subscriber's cable service is out of order for more than 48 consecutive hours during the month due to technical failure, damage, or circumstances within the control of the grantee, the grantee will credit the account of that subscriber on a pro rata basis upon the subscriber's written request. The credit will be calculated using the number of 24-hour periods that service is impaired and the number of channels on which service is impaired as a fraction of the total number of days in the month that the service impairment occurs and the total number of channels provided by the system in the absence of an impairment.

                  ARTICLE III. - CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 58-61. - Office location and telephone service. 
                  The grantee shall maintain an office in sufficient proximity to the town to permit grantee's customer service and technical personnel to promptly respond to all customer service requests or technical problems which may arise, as further described below. The grantee shall maintain a telephone answering service or an answering machine to receive service calls 24 hours per day. A listed local telephone number or toll free (800) number shall be made available to subscribers for service calls. Corrective action shall be completed as promptly as practicable.

                  Sec. 58-62. - Customer service response time. 
                  (a)  Calls requesting repair service shall be responded to the same day they are received, whenever it is physically possible to do so. In the event this is not possible, repair calls notifying the grantee of a service outage shall be responded to no later than 48 hours after receipt. If a service call is received after 3:00 p.m. on Friday, every attempt shall be made to respond within 48 hours. 
                  (b)  In establishing response time to service or repair calls, the grantee may differentiate between service problems unique to a single household as compared to problems caused by a service outage which affects a large number of subscribers (area outage). The term "area outage" is defined as an outage of all cable channels in four or more residences in the same neighborhood or area which is caused by a problem with the cable system, rather than being caused by the subscriber or by a cause beyond the grantee's control, such as a loss of power from the local electric company. 
                  (c)  All area outages shall be responded to as soon as possible after notification on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week basis. Designated technicians shall be on call 24 hours a day to respond when notified by phone or paged by grantee or an answering service employee. Technicians are expected to repair the problem found and have the system operational as soon as possible. Except for circumstances beyond the grantee's control such as acts of God, weather, wars, riots and civil disturbances, the grantee shall be capable of locating and correcting system malfunctions promptly.

                  (a)  The grantee shall not, without good cause, fail to make available cable service to prospective subscribers nor shall the grantee terminate service without good cause. Service shall be provided to all interested customers where economically feasible and consistent with the line extension provisions contained in this article. 
                  (b)  Unless a written contract exists between the grantee and a subscriber, service shall be on a month-to-month basis.

                  Sec. 58-64. - Protection of privacy. 
                  (a)  The grantee and the franchising authority will constantly guard against possible abuses of the right of privacy or other rights of any subscriber or person. In particular, the grantee shall comply with the privacy provisions of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47 USC 551. 
                  (b)  The grantee shall not permit the transmission of any signal, aural, visual or digital from any subscriber's premises without first obtaining the informed consent of the subscriber, which shall not have been obtained from the subscriber as a condition of any service for which transmission is not an essential element. The request for such consent shall be contained in a separate document which enumerates and describes the transmissions being authorized and includes a prominent statement that the subscriber is authorizing the permission in full knowledge of its provision, and shall be revocable at any time by the subscriber without penalty of any kind whatsoever. This provision is not intended to prohibit the use or transmission of signals useful only for the control or measurement of system performance or used only for billing subscribers or providing basic or optional services. 
                  (c)  The grantee shall not permit the use of any special terminal equipment in any subscriber's premises that shall permit transmission from the subscriber's premises of two-way services utilizing aural, visual or digital signals without first obtaining written permission of the subscriber as provided in subsection (b) of this section. 
                  (d)  The grantee, or any of its agents or employees, shall not, without the specific written authorization of the subscriber involved, sell or otherwise make available to any party any list which identifies the viewing habits or responses of individual subscribers.

                  Sec. 58-65. - Extension of cable service. 
                  (a)  A grantee which is not already serving the entire franchise area shall provide service to all portions of the franchise area reaching a minimum density of 30 dwelling units per linear street mile as measured from the nearest system trunk line within one year after the grant of a franchise. 
                  (b)  The grantee shall provide aerial or buried drop lines to new subdivisions within the franchise area at the request of the developer provided that the developer contracts and agrees with the grantee to pay the cost of the extension of the service. 
                  (c)  The grantee shall extend and make cable television service available to any resident within the franchise area who requests connection at the standard connection charge if the connection to the resident would require no more than a standard 150-foot aerial or 75-foot buried drop line. With respect to requests for connection requiring an aerial or buried drop line in excess of 150 feet and 75 feet respectively, the grantee shall extend and make available cable television service to such residents at a connection charge not to exceed the actual cost incurred by the grantee for the distance exceeding that distance. 
                  (d)  In areas with less than 30 residential units per proposed cable bearing strand mile, the grantee shall offer a cost-sharing arrangement with residents. A dwelling unit will be counted for this purpose if its lot fronts a street. The cost-sharing arrangement shall consist of the following: 
                  (1)  At the request of a resident desiring service, the grantee shall determine the cost of the plant extension required to provide service to the potential subscriber from the closest point on the cable system where it is technically feasible. The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following formula: 
                  If a request for extension of service into a residential area requires the construction of a cable plant which does not pass at least 30 potential subscribers per proposed cable bearing strand mile, grantee and residents who agree to subscribe to cable service will each bear their proportionate share of construction costs. For example, if there are five dwelling units per proposed cable bearing strand mile, grantee's share will equal 5/30 or one sixth of the construction cost. The remaining cost will be shared equally by each subscriber. 
                  (2)  Should additional residents actually subscribe to cable television service in areas where subscribers have already paid a proportionate share under the extension cost sharing formula, subscribers who have previously paid a proportionate share under the extension formula shall be reimbursed pro rata for their contribution or a proportional share thereof. In such case, the pro rata shares shall be recalculated and each new subscriber shall pay the new pro rata share, and all subscribers who previously paid a proportionate share shall receive pro rata refunds. In the event such subscribers (or prior subscribers) have been disconnected or has moved and owes the grantee money which has not been recovered, grantee shall have the right to first apply the refund to amounts owed the grantee and give the balance, if any, to the subscriber. At such time as there are 30 potential subscribers per cable bearing strand mile, the subscribers shall receive their pro rata share of construction costs. In any event, one year after the completion of a project, subscribers who have paid a share of line extension costs are no longer eligible for refunds, and the amounts paid in construction costs will be credited to the plant account of the grantee.

                  Sec. 58-66. - Free basic cable service to public buildings. 
                  The grantee shall provide, without charge, one service outlet activated for basic subscriber service to each police station, fire station, public school, public library and the town office. If it is necessary to extend grantee's trunk or feeder lines more than 200 feet solely to provide service to any such school or public building, the town or the building owner or occupants shall have the option of either paying grantee's direct costs for line extensions in excess of 200 feet or releasing the grantee from the obligation to provide service to such building. Furthermore, grantee shall be permitted to recover the direct cost of installing cable service, when requested to do so, in order to provide: 
                  (1)  More than one outlet; 
                  (2)  Inside wiring; or 
                  (3)  A service outlet requiring more than 200 feet of drop cable.

                  Within 90 days following the grant of a franchise the grantee shall obtain, pay all premiums for and make available to the franchising authority at its request copies of the following insurance policies: 
                  (1)  A general comprehensive liability policy indemnifying, defending and saving harmless the town, its officers, boards, commissions, agents or employees from any and all claims by any person whatsoever on account of injury to or death of a person or persons occasioned by the operations of the grantee under the franchise herein granted, or alleged to have been so caused or occurred, with a minimum liability of $500,000.00 per personal injury or death of any one person, and $1,000,000.00 for personal injury or death of any two or more persons in any one occurrence. 
                  (2)  Property damage insurance for property damage occasioned by the operation of grantee under the franchise herein granted, or alleged to have been so caused or occurred, with a minimum liability of $500,000.00 for property damage to the property of any one person and $1,000,000.00 for property damage to the property of two or more persons in any one occurrence. 
                  (3)  All insurance policies called for herein shall be in a form satisfactory to the franchising authority and shall require 30 days' written notice of any cancellation to both the franchising authority and the grantee. The grantee shall, in the event of any such cancellation notice, obtain, pay all premiums for, and file with the franchising authority, written evidence of the issuance of replacement policies within 30 days following receipt by the franchising authority or the grantee of any notice of cancellation.

These damages shall include, but not be limited to, penalties arising out of copyright infringements and damages arising out of any failure by grantee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors or licensees of programs to be delivered by the grantee's cable television system whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by the franchise.

                  Sec. 58-91. - Procedures in the event of alleged violations. 
                  A grantee may be penalized by the franchising authority only in the event of a substantial violation or breach of a material provision of this chapter. If the franchising authority believes that such a breach has occurred and that there may be sufficient cause to penalize the grantee, the following procedures shall be followed: 
                  (1)  Notice, response and opportunity to cure alleged violations . 
                  a.  The franchising authority shall notify the grantee in writing of any alleged violation or failure to meet any of the terms or provisions of this article. The grantee shall be given 30 days from the date of receipt of such notice to respond in writing, stating its explanation for the alleged violations and what actions, if any, have been or are being taken to cure such breach. 
                  b.  Upon receipt of the grantee's response, the franchising authority may accept the grantee's explanation and/or remedy proposed. Alternatively, if the franchising authority does not accept the grantee's explanation or believes that the breach will not be properly cured within a 120-day period from the date of the original notice of violation, the franchising authority may send to the grantee a notice of its intent to penalize the grantee. 
                  (2)  Public hearing required . Prior to issuing a notice of intent to penalize the grantee, the franchising authority shall hold a public hearing providing due process at which testimony and evidence shall be taken concerning the alleged violation. Representatives of the town and the grantee shall be permitted to address the subject of the alleged violation and related issues at the public hearing. The grantee may submit evidence to the franchising authority that it is diligently pursuing reasonable actions to cure the alleged violation or that there are circumstances beyond its control (force majeure) which prevent the grantee from curing the alleged breach until some future date. Such showings shall be sufficient to relieve the grantee from an alleged breach of this chapter and/or the grantee's franchise. The franchising authority may require the grantee to provide periodic reports updating the franchising authority on progress being made to cure any unresolved problem. 
                  (3)  Notice and cure of franchise violations . 
                  a.  If, following a public hearing, the franchising authority believes that the grantee is in breach, the franchising authority may issue a notice of intent to penalize the grantee or revoke its franchise. 
                  b.  The grantee shall be given a period of 60 days from the date of the issuance of the notice to cure any alleged violation of this chapter. If the alleged violation is not cured within the specified 60-day period, the franchising authority may take the appropriate steps necessary to penalize the grantee or revoke the franchise. Provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or restrict the grantee's rights to appeal the town's actions in any appropriate state or federal judicial or administrative forum. 
                  (4)  Franchise termination and continuity of service . 
                  a.  In the event that the franchising authority denies renewal or revokes the franchise, which denial or revocation is upheld by a final judicial determination, the grantee shall be afforded a period of one year from the effective date of the final order denying renewal or revoking the franchise, including any appeal, within which to transfer or convey the assets of the cable system. Approval of such a transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
                  b.  In the event the franchise is terminated, whether by revocation, expiration, or otherwise, the grantee may continue to operate the cable system pursuant to the terms and conditions of the terminated franchise, until the happening of one of the following: 
                  1.  A new franchise or an extension of an expired franchise is granted; 
                  2.  In the case of a revocation or a denial of renewal, a final judicial adjudication has been made, including any appeal, which has resulted in a finding or order that grantee is not entitled to a reinstatement, renewal or extension of the franchise and is not otherwise entitled by law to continue operation of the cable system; 
                  3.  The passage of six months with no appeal to an appellate court.

                  A grantee may transfer or assign its franchise to another entity (the "assignee") upon 30 days' notice to the franchising authority. The consent of the franchising authority shall not be required for such an assignment, provided that: 
                  (1)  The franchising authority is provided with a reasonable showing that the proposed assignee possesses the technical and financial qualifications to operate the cable TV system; and 
                  (2)  The assignee agrees to comply with the material terms of this chapter. 
                  In no event shall the franchising authority unreasonably delay or deny the assignment or transfer of a franchise. The reasonableness of the franchising authority's actions shall be subject to judicial review by a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

                  (b)  If, following a review of the information provided to it, the franchising authority determines that the proposed assignee may not be technically and financially qualified to operate the cable system, the procedures below shall be followed: 
                  (1)  Within 30 days following receipt of the notice of proposed assignment from the grantee, the franchising authority shall inform the grantee in writing by certified mail of its intent to hold a hearing, providing due process to the grantee and the assignee, for the purpose of receiving evidence as to the assignee's technical and financial qualifications. Such hearing shall be held by the town within 45 days following receipt of the notice of assignment. 
                  (2)  Within 14 days following the date of the hearing, the franchising authority shall make a formal determination regarding the proposed assignment and if it determines that the proposed assignee is not qualified to operate the cable system or it determines for any other reason not to assign the franchise, it shall send a written explanation of its decision to the grantee by certified mail no later than 14 days after the public hearing has been held.

                  Sec. 58-123. - Pledge for security purposes or assignment to a related entity. 
                  The grantee may secure financing or an indebtedness by trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation of the franchise, in whole or in part, without requiring the consent of the franchising authority. Consent shall not be required to assign a franchise from one business entity to another which is operated or managed by the present grantee or manager of the system. In addition, so long as the manager or/and general partner of the grantee remains the same, consent shall not be required to transfer interests of any limited partners of the grantee, who have no day to day operational control of the grantee or the town system.
