PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Reidsville, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1989 Code, as supplemented through January 7, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1989 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Stephanie Benesh and Paula B. Freeman, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Charles E. Rewis, Mayor; Curtis V. Cheney, Jr., City Attorney; Hector M. Delgado, Assistant to the City Attorney; and Kellie Murray, City Clerk; for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Laws (Act No. 848), p. 3273. Amendments to this 1978 Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision derives unchanged from the 1978 Charter. Affidavits and notices of intent that accompanied the act have been omitted. A uniform system of headings, catchlines, numbering and punctuation has been used. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation and material in brackets [ ] has been added, if necessary, for clarity.

                  (d)	Whenever in opening, extending or widening any street, avenue, alley or public place of the city, a small parcel or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the city, the council may authorize the mayor to execute and deliver in the name of the city a deed conveying said cut-off or separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining property owner or owners in exchange for rights-of-way of said street, avenue, alley or public place or in settlement of any alleged damages sustained by said abutting or adjoining property owner.

                  (b)	The phrase "violation of this Code" does not include the failure of a city officer or city employee to perform an official duty, unless it is provided that failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this section or it is clear from the context of this Code that it is the intent of the city to impose the penalty provided for in this section upon the city officer or employee.

                  (f)	Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief and by such other means as are provided by law. Further, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code or any such ordinance, resolution, rules, regulation or order shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated by the city as provided by law.

                  Sec. 2-156. - Policy. 
                  The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use public office in order to improve his own private standing. The principle policies which form the foundation of this article are: 
                  (1)	The trust of citizens in their government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity. 
                  (2)	The constitutions, laws and regulations of the United States and State of Georgia and ordinances of the city should be upheld as a de minimus standard of conduct. 
                  (3)	The most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act with the highest moral principles and to consistently react appropriately to the ethical decisions of others.

                  (2)	Repeatedly chased or otherwise threatened persons or other domestic animals in a vicious or menacing manner indicating a reasonable likelihood that the animal will cause imminent physical injury; or

                  (d)	Factors to be considered at hearing. The city, after receiving all pertinent testimony and evidence on the matter, shall decide whether the animal shall be destroyed as a public nuisance. In making its decision, the city shall consider whether the animal constitutes such a physical threat to persons or other animals, or of significant destruction or harm to property, by virtue of one or more unprovoked attacks on persons, other domestic animals, or physical property that destruction of the animal is reasonably necessary to protect the health, welfare, or property in the city. 
                  (e)	Determination that animal must be destroyed. If the city decides that said animal should be destroyed, then the owner shall promptly be given written notice thereof, and the animal shall be humanely destroyed any time after five business days after the date of such written notice of the decision of the city in accordance with state law. 
                  (f)	Determination that animal is a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog. If the city decides the animal should not be destroyed, the city shall determine whether such animal shall be classified as a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog. If the city determines that such dog shall be classified as a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog, the owner shall promptly be given written notice thereof, and the dog shall continue to be impounded by city until the owner shall have complied with all the requirements of this article, after which the animal will be returned to the owner. If the owner fails to meet said requirements within ten business days following written notice of the decision of the authorized official classifying of the dog as a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog, or to timely request a hearing appealing such decision, the dog shall be humanely destroyed in accordance with state law; provided, however, that the city may extend said time for up to an additional 15-day period upon payment by the owner of the per diem boarding costs for said dog. 
                  (g)	Fees and costs. The owner of an animal confiscated under the provisions of this section shall pay a fee of $50.00 and reimburse the city for all costs of housing, feeding, and any medical treatment of said animal.

                  (a)	Best management practices as set forth in this section and section 16-46 shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f). As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. 
                  (b)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. 
                  (c)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (d)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.

                  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this section, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this article; 
                  (10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills; 
                  (11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  (12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)	Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 16-45(b). 
                  (15)	Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 25 feet of the banks of any state waters, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; provided, however, that buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to the Metropolitan River Protection Act shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection; and 
                  (16)	Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 100 horizontal feet, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, of the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., unless a variance for such activity is granted by the director, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented.

                  Sec. 16-181. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)	The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 10-12-2010, art. 1, § B)
                  Sec. 16-182. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided that the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. Accessory structures are not exempt from any article requirements. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
                  (1)	Those improvements of a structure required to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  (2)	Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions occur when the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article, is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 16-285. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)	New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)	Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor, formed by the foundation and exterior walls, shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.	Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  3.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions; 
                  b.	So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criterion of this subsection, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for the parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork) and all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure that is not compliant with the provisions of this article shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. of 10-12-2010, art. 4, § A)
                  Sec. 16-286. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and/or substantial improvements. 
                  a.	Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-285(4). 
                  b.	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 16-253(6). 
                  (3)	Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved:
                  1.	On individual lots or parcels;
                  2.	In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
                  3.	In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
                  4.	On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement as set forth in section 16-285(6). 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must:
                  1.	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
                  2.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.	Meet all the requirements of new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of section 16-286(3). 
                  (4)	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-185 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided that it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.	If subsection 4(a) of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division 4.

                  Sec. 16-287. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-185, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)	When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 16-185, then the mayor shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source in order to administer the provisions of division 4 of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  b.	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. The lowest floor is required to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-285(4). 
                  c.	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The mayor shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Sec. 16-288. - Standards for areas of special flood hazard (AE zones) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-185, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated (AE zones), the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)	No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)	New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with section 16-286.

                  Sec. 16-289. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding. 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-185 may include designated shallow flooding areas (AO zones). These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)	All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-285(4). The mayor shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (3)	New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as required in section 16-252. 
                  (4)	Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  (a)	The planning and zoning board as established by the City of Reidsville shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)	The planning and zoning board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning and zoning board may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Tattnall County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)	In reviewing such requests, the planning and zoning board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)	Conditions for variances.
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The zoning board shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the city planning and zoning board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  (b)	For each violation and noncompliance, the violator shall be subject to penalties as provided in section 1-14.

                  (b)	For purposes of this section, it shall be prima facie evidence of an overcrowding condition when either there are more people in the building or portion thereof than has been allowed or posted, or when, in the judgment of the fire chief or his representative, a threat to the safety of life exists due to the number of persons sitting or standing so as to obstruct or impede the use of aisles, passages, corridors or exits. 
                  (c)	It is the responsibility of the owner, manager or person in charge of a building, structure, or portion thereof, to prevent an overcrowding condition to exist and to take prompt action to remedy an overcrowding condition when so advised or ordered by the fire chief or his representative.

                  Sec. 24-71. - Purpose. 
                  (a)	The city has determined that there has been an increase in juvenile violence and crime by persons under the age of 18 in the city resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior by juveniles; that persons under the age of 18 are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful activity and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime; that there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision and guidance normally provided by parents for minors resulting in an increase in the crimes, substance abuse, and school dropout rates, juvenile pregnancy, and other illicit behavior. 
                  (b)	The city has an obligation to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other persons, for the enforcement of parental control over and responsibility for children, for the protection of the general public, and for the reduction of the incidence of juvenile criminal activities which are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances. 
                  (c)	The city has determined a curfew for those under the age of 18 will be in the interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare and will help to attain the foregoing objectives and to diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct on the citizens of the city and will promote the public good, safety and welfare. 
                  (d)	Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm, and legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had demonstrated effectiveness in many cities. The city has determined that curfew regulations will increase parental responsibility for minors within their control and decrease minor delinquency.

                  (Ord. of 12-8-2014(2), § 1)
                  Sec. 24-186. - Complaint in rem in municipal court; procedure; lien; appeal. 
                  (a)	Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the municipality charging that any dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure or property and make a written report of his findings. Such officer shall be guided in his investigation by documenting conditions, which include but are not limited to: 
                  (1)	Defects therein increasing the hazards of fire, accidents, or other calamities;
                  (2)	Lack of adequate ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities;
                  (3)	Dilapidation;
                  (4)	Disrepair by failure to conform to applicable codes and ordinances;

                  (6)	Uncleanliness; or
                  (7)	The presence of graffiti which is visible from adjoining public or private property.
                  (b)	If the public officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall file a complaint in rem in the municipal court of the city against the lot, tract or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties in such dwelling, building or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before the municipal court at a date and time certain and at a place within the county or municipality where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days, nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
                  (c)	If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)	If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)	If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification, as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, chapter 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (d)	If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, the public officer shall cause such dwelling, building or structure to be repaired, altered or improved, or to be vacated and closed, or demolished within 270 days of the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling or structure a placard with the following words: 
                   "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (e)	If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (f)	The amount of the cost of the abatement of any nuisance or demolition by public officers, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (g)	The lien provided for in subsection (f) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court in Tattnall County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under section 24-187. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within 90 days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
                  (h)	It shall be the duty of the city administrator to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The city administrator may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (i)	The city administrator may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the city to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (j)	The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (k)	Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement or demolition of a dwelling, building or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  Sec. 24-187. - Service of complaints or orders upon owners and parties in interest. 
                  (a)	Summons and copies of the complaint shall be served in the following manner:
                  (1)	In all cases, a copy of the complaint and summons shall be conspicuously posted on the subject dwelling, building, structure or property within three business days of filing of the complaint and at least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing; 
                  (2)	At least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing, the public officer shall mail copies of the complaint and summons by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, to all interested parties whose identities and addresses are readily ascertainable. Copies of the complaint and summons shall also be mailed by first class mail to the property address to the attention of the occupants, if any; 
                  (3)	For interested parties whose mailing address is unknown, a notice stating the date, time and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriffs advertisements appear in such county once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the hearing; and 
                  (4)	A notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court in which the dwelling, building, structure or property is located at the time of filing the complaint in municipal court. 
                  (b)	The public officer shall cause an affidavit of service to be filed of record in the municipal court prior to the hearing showing compliance with the service requirements of this section. Such affidavit shall constitute a prima facie showing of minimum procedural due process and shall constitute sufficient proof that service was perfected. 
                  (c)	Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this section on every interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings. 
                  (Ord. of 12-8-2014(2), § 1)
                  Sec. 24-188. - Limitation of liability for code enforcement; no special duty created. 
                  It is the intent of this division to protect the public health, life safety and general welfare of properties and occupiers of buildings and structures within the city in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. Approval of a permit and inspection of a property shall in no manner guarantee or warrant to the owner or occupants thereof that said property has been constructed, maintained, or operated in conformance with applicable codes, laws and regulations. The city reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any federal or state law, regulation or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professional(s), and contractor(s) to satisfy such legal requirements.

                  The owner and occupant of property within the city shall each be independently responsible for keeping the premises, including all buildings thereon and the full yard thereof, clean and free from all garbage, refuse, filth, dirt, ashes, trash, rubbish and other offensive materials.

                  Sec. 24-190. - Disorderly house. 
                  (a)	Any person who keeps and maintains, either by himself or others, a common, ill-governed and disorderly house, to the encouragement of gaming, drinking, illicit drug activity, or other misbehavior, to the common disturbance of the neighborhood or orderly citizens, shall be guilty of an offense against the city; provided, however, before any person is charged under this subsection, written notice shall be given the owner of the property and the person in possession thereof by the chief of police stating the general, customary and common habits of the house, giving fair notice of this subsection and the conduct proscribed thereby. 
                  (b)	Any person who shall allow any boisterous, noisy, drunken or riotous persons to assemble or remain in their house, apartment or upon their property, after receiving oral notice from a police officer that boisterous, noisy, drunken or carousing activities have caused complaint and annoyance to the common disturbance of the neighborhood or orderly citizens, shall be guilty of an offense against the city; provided, however, no person shall be charged under this subsection unless the owner or person in possession of the premises has been afforded an opportunity to disburse the assembly or offending person from the premises. This subsection shall not preclude a police officer from arresting any individual for criminal trespass where such individual knowingly and without authority remains on private property after being notified by the owner or lawful occupant to depart.

In addition to the foregoing fines, upon conviction, the director shall discontinue the public water supply service at any premises upon which there is found to be a cross-connection, auxiliary intake, by-pass, or inter-connection, and service shall not be restored until such cross-connection, auxiliary, by-pass, or inter-connection has been discontinued.

                  Sec. 32-206. - Required improvements. 
                  (a)	Every subdivider shall be required to have installed by the appropriate city agency at the subdivider's expense, or with approval of the agency concerned to install the following street improvements and utilities: 
                  (1)	Street grading, street basing, and street paving, in accordance with city specifications.
                  (2)	Sanitary sewer lines and manholes, surface drainage facilities, permanent reference monuments, street name signs, and road regulatory signs as recommended by the city engineer. 
                  (3)	If a required sewer line cannot be connected to a trunk line sewer at the time of the development of the subdivision, septic tanks or a lift station shall be installed by and at the expense of the subdivider or lot purchaser for interim use, in conformity with the requirements of the city or county health department. 
                  (4)	Water mains within the subdivision which shall comply with city specifications.
                  (5)	All subdivisions with underground electrical lines shall have placed appropriate utility poles for street lighting. All required street improvements, utilities, and monuments shall be built to standards specified by the agency responsible for each. All utilities to be installed in the streets shall be placed and compacted prior to paving. 
                  (b)	In order to encourage residential subdivision development inside the corporate limits, the city may, at its option, provide incentives to developers for property meeting the following criteria: 
                  (1)	The property must either be within the city limits, or pre-annexed into the city prior to any sketch plan or preliminary platting so that the property is developed totally under the city's subdivision ordinance, zoning ordinance, and other land use regulatory ordinances. Property outside the city must meet the requirements for annexation under state statutes, so that the property is clearly within the city limits before any incentives can be contract for or received. 
                  (2)	The property must be zoned R-1, R-1A, R-2 or R-3 by the city. The city may consider extending these incentives to property zoned PUD. The intent of this provision is to allow developers flexibility in developing cluster housing on smaller lots, with a corresponding increase in open space in common ownership maintained by a homeowners' association or similar entity. 
                  (3)	The property must be reasonably close to existing water and sewer lines such that the city can economically extend the main lines to the subdivision. Such determination shall be made at the discretion of the city. Should more than one property owner make application for this incentive program in any fiscal year, the city reserves the right to decide which of the subdivisions is most economical for it to help develop, and to only develop those for which it has adequate funding in any given fiscal year. More than one subdivision per year may be developed if determined by the mayor and city council to be economically and financially feasible. If financial constraints dictate, no subdivision developments, with city participation, may be approved. 
                  (4)	The subdivider must enter into a written agreement with the city, in a form acceptable to the city attorney, delineating the subdivider's and city's respective responsibilities for the various components of development. 
                  (5)	The subdivider must develop the subdivision using underground electric, telephone, and CATV lines, curb and gutter, sidewalks on at least one side of each street, decorative street lights and poles, and covenants and restrictions requiring brick veneer or comparable construction and a minimum of a two-car enclosed garage. The intent is to develop subdivisions with high-end amenities compared to the existing market in the county. 
                  (6)	The subdivision must be developed in reasonably-sized phases so as not to place a financial strain on either the developer of the city. 
                  (c)	The city may, at its option, provide the following incentives for the proposed subdivisions meeting the criteria in subsection (b) of this section: 
                  (1)	The city will pay 50 percent of the entire cost to install the water and sewer system in an approved subdivision, following review and comment on the proposed plans by the city's engineers. 
                  (2)	The city will pay 50 percent of street development costs, including curb, gutter and sidewalk if required. 
                  (3)	The city will install all street signs and traffic signs within the subdivision.

                  Sec. 32-207. - Bond in lieu of completion of improvements. 
                  (a)	The planning commission may allow the subdivider to post a bond as defined below in lieu of completion of all the improvements as required by this article. The bond shall be made payable to the city and shall be of an amount sufficient to ensure completion of all required improvements. The bond shall be approved and held until a specified reasonable length of time for completion has passed, after which the bond may be forfeited and the improvements installed by the city. The bond may be made in any of the following manners: 
                  (1)	Cash bond;
                  (2)	Insurance bond in the nature of a performance bond by an insurance carrier approved by the city planning commission; or 
                  (3)	Bond in the form of a personal guaranty of the developer, properly secured by a first deed to secure debt on real estate located in the state, which is of a value at least double the amount of the estimated cost of the mandatory improvements as identified by these regulations, and the cost estimated shall be made in the sole discretion of the city planning commission. The deed to secure debt is given to ensure the city of full compliance with these regulations, including holding the city harmless as to any court cost or attorney fees incurred to enforce these regulations or enforcement of this performance bond. 
                  (b)	In the event the subdivider posts bond under the provisions of this section, the bonding period shall be a five-year period. If, after five years, the city has not provided trunk line sewerage to the subdivision or has not contracted to provide trunk line sewerage, or has not committed itself to provide trunk line sewerage within 12 months of the expiration of the five-year period, then all obligation of the subdivider to continue the bond shall be terminated. 
                  (c)	The subdivision developer and his performance bond shall continue to be accountable for the above regulations until the regulations are completed on the subdivision to the reasonable satisfaction of the city planning commission.

                  Sec. 38-149. - Findings of fact. 
                  The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities.

                  Sec. 38-150. - Reference map. 
                  The official maps to be used as the determinant for location of wetlands in the city and to be regulated areas under this article will be the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Tattnall County. These maps portray generalized wetlands inventory areas, and these wetlands inventory areas do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland delineation by that agency.

                  Sec. 38-151. - Wetlands development permit requirements. 
                  No activity or use except those identified in section 38-152 shall be allowed within wetlands without a permit under this article. Activities or uses permitted under former section 404 of the federal Water Pollution Control Act, popularly known as the federal Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1251 et seq., may receive a local permit once any required federal permit, or if appropriate, letter of permission and determination, is obtained as described below, and any other applicable provisions of this article have been satisfied: 
                  (1)	If there is a determination in the administration of this article that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein would not be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and would not disturb an identified wetlands inventory area, no further action concerning this particular section is necessary. 
                  (2)	If there is a determination in the administration of this article that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein may be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and might disturb wetlands which appear to be under the jurisdiction of section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination shall be required prior to issuance of a permit under this article. 
                  (3)	If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination is required, no local permit under this article will be issued until the person requesting the permit, at their own expense, obtains either a section 404 permit, if so required, or a letter of permission/determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that no federal permit is required. 
                  (4)	No action in the administration of this article, or no local permit issued pursuant to this article relieves the landowner from any federal or state permitting requirements, including those relating to wetlands or land disturbance.

                  The following uses are permitted without permit within the wetlands of the city to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein: 
                  (1)	Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission. 
                  (2)	Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, or other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require a section 404 permit. 
                  (3)	Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  (4)	Natural water quality treatment or purification.
                  (5)	Normal agriculture activities including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture.

                  Sec. 38-175. - Findings of fact. 
                  Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste, like septic tank effluents, contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  (Ord. of 8-13-2001, § 7(7.1))
                  Sec. 38-176. - Reference map. 
                  The official map for delineation of significant groundwater recharge areas in the city to be regulated areas under this article is the state department of natural resources' "Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 edition)."

                  All uses except those identified in section 38-178 and those subject to further restriction by any underlying zoning district are allowed. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
                  (1)	All new above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks, and shall otherwise meet the requirements of US EPA rules for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112.1. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  (2)	All single-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings, mobile home parks, or other uses located within a groundwater recharge area and not served by both public water and sewer systems shall be required to have 150 percent of the minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of tables MT-1 and MT-2 of the most recent edition of the state department of human resources manual for on-site sewage management systems.The minimums set forth in tables MT-1 and MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A-F) of the DHR manual. The minimum lot size shall not be in any case less than the minimum lot size specified by any underlying zoning district. The regulations specifying the largest minimum lot size shall apply. 
                  (3)	All lots shall have a minimum width of 150 feet, or as specified in any underlying zoning district if stricter (larger), in the area where an approved on-site sewage management system is to be located. 
                  (4)	No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank or other on-site sewage management system unless the county health department first approves the proposed on-site sewage management system installation as meeting the requirements of the state department of human resources manual for on-site sewage management systems and the provisions of this article. 
                  (5)	All new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner except for the construction of mining settling basins. 
                  (6)	All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compact clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 × 10-7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service.

                  Sec. 38-210. - Findings of fact. 
                  Perennial rivers or watercourses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second are of vital importance to the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. These river corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 8-13-2001, § 8(8.1))
                  Sec. 38-211. - District delineation. 
                  The term "protected rivers," as defined under the rules for environmental planning criteria, adopted by the state department of natural resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, includes any perennial river or watercourses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second. The Altamaha River and the Ohoopee River through Tattnall County meet this criteria. A protected river corridor and a protective 100-foot vegetation buffer is hereby established along the entire length of these rivers within Tattnall County. The buffer area is measured horizontally from each river bank, if any, within the city jurisdiction. Under the method prescribed by the rules for environmental planning criteria, no development or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the protected river corridor and within a 100-foot buffer of the river bank except for the permitted uses in section 38-212. 
                  (Ord. of 8-13-2001, § 8(8.2))
                  Sec. 38-212. - Permitted uses. 
                  No development, or construction, or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the 100-foot buffer from the protected river except for the following uses, and the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land disturbing activity or construction permitted within the river corridor for these acceptable uses: 
                  (1)	Single-family dwellings, if any underlying zoning district so permits, provided each dwelling is located on a lot with a minimum size as specified by the county health department or the underlying zoning district regulations, but shall be the greater of these requirements; however, in any case, the lot for each dwelling shall not be less than two acres, not including any area between the river banks; and provided the septic tank drainfield is located outside of the 100-foot buffer area. 
                  (2)	Any residential uses existing or under construction prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, provided the use has an on-site sewage management construction permit issued by the county health department prior to the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
                  (3)	Any industrial or commercial uses existing prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, provided they do not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended, and meet all other federal and state environmental regulations. 
                  (4)	Road and utility crossings, providing the construction of these crossings meets the requirements of the state Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended, or any local requirements, if stricter. 
                  (5)	Timber production and harvesting, providing it is consistent with the best management practices established by the state forestry commission, and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (6)	Agricultural production and management, provided it is consistent with the best management practices established by the state soil and water conservation commission, and all other state and federal laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the state department of agriculture and the state environmental protection division; and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (7)	Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8.

                  (2)	Consider the changes in community characteristics which may take place because of the proposed change, and consider the consistency with and effect of the change on current public growth and development policies and plans. 
                  (3)	Consider the relative effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the present wording or distracting of this chapter, and whether a justification for change exists because of special reasons or a change in conditions. 
                  (4)	Consider the effect upon the public interest of granting or denying the proposed change, and determine that the change will serve the best interests of the city, as compared to any hardship imposed upon the individual property owner.

                  (7)	Consider the unique characteristics of the property involved, and whether the property to be affected by the zoning proposal has some reasonable economic use as currently zoned or whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing zoning. 
                  (8)	Consider the effect of the proposed change upon the logical, efficient, and economical extensions of public services and facilities, or possible overtaxing or burdening of existing public services or facilities, including but not limited to utilities, streets, schools, and public safety services, and also the associated costs to the local government in providing, improving, increasing, or maintaining such facilities and services. 
                  (9)	Consider the impact of the change with respect to probable effects upon highway traffic and safety, and especially access near intersections. 
                  (10)	Consider the impact of the proposed change upon the environment, including but not limited to drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, noise, air quality, and water quality and quantity. 
                  (11)	Determine that the zoning proposal will permit suitable use or uses in view of the subject property/physical characteristics, the use and development of adjacent and nearby properties, existing zoning patterns, existing or proposed public facilities or services, environmental impacts, and current public growth and development policies and plans of the city. 
                  (12)	Consider whether the change is designed to correct an improper situation, or would merely result in the granting of special privileges not available to adjacent or surrounding properties. 
                  (13)	Consider the conformity of the proposed change with the city's adopted comprehensive plan. 
                  (14)	Consider any other factors relevant to balancing the city's interests in promoting and protecting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare against a right to unrestricted use of property.

                  The planning and zoning commission shall hear and decide upon all variances to the city's zoning chapter. All variances will follow the same public notice and procedural requirements as in a rezoning request by a property owner. 
                  (Ord. of 1-12-2009, § 14.00)
                  Sec. 40-178. - Request for a variance. 
                  The planning and zoning commission may authorize in specific cases such variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done; provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this chapter in the district in question. Such variance may be granted in an individual case upon a finding by the planning and zoning commission that the following exists: 
                  (1)	There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography; 
                  (2)	The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; 
                  (3)	Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved;
                  (4)	Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of these regulations, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this chapter; 
                  (5)	A literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the applicant of any rights that others in the same district are allowed; and 
                  (6)	Provided that the planning and zoning commission imposes or requires such additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; and provided, that wherever the planning and zoning commission shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations that any of the terms, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, the planning and zoning commission shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.

                  Sec. 40-262. - Interpretation of district boundaries. 
                  The boundaries between districts are, unless otherwise indicated, either the centerlines of streets, lanes, watercourses, rights-of-way of power lines and other public utilities or such lines extended or lines parallel thereto. Where the boundaries of a single district are indicated as including directly opposite sides of a street, lane, lake, or watercourse, or right-of-way of a power line of other public utility, for any portion of its length, the district so indicated shall be construed to apply to the entire bed of such street, lane, lake or watercourse, or right-of-way of such power line, railroad or other public utility, lying within such portion of its length. Where uncertainty exists as to the location of any the boundaries as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
                  (1)	Where a district boundary is indicated approximately following the centerline of a street, lane, lake or watercourse, or right-of-way of a power line or other public utility, such centerline shall be construed to be such boundary. 
                  (2)	Where a district boundary is indicated as approximately following a lot line or other property line, such lot line or other property line shall be construed to be such boundary. 
                  (3)	Where a district boundary divides a lot or runs through undivided property, the location of such boundary, unless otherwise specified by figures on the zoning map, shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map. 
                  (4)	Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the corporate limits of the city, such corporate limits shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  (5)	Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately parallel to the centerline of streets or highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance or indication is given on the zoning map, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale as shown on the zoning map. 
                  (6)	Where a district boundary line divides a lot which is a single ownership lot at the time of the enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the use classification of the larger portion may be extended to the remainder without recourse to amendment procedure except that such extension shall not include any part of a lot that lies more than 25 feet beyond the district boundary line. 
                  (7)	In case any further uncertainty exists after applying the above rules, the city council shall interpret the intent of the zoning map and determine the location of such. 
                  (8)	Where a public road, street, alley, or other right-of-way is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to the property to which it is reverted shall apply to such vacated or abandoned road, street, alley or right-of-way.

In the event of annexation of new areas to the city, such areas shall be considered to be in the R-40 district until otherwise classified.

                  (2)	Have narrower or smaller front, rear, or side yards, or other open spaces than are herein required, or in any other manner contrary to the provisions and intent of this chapter. 
                  (3)	Occupy a greater percentage of the area of the lot than required.
                  (b)	No part of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading required about or in connection with any building for the purpose of complying with this chapter shall be included as part of a yard, open space, or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other building. 
                  (c)	Right-of-way easements for streets and roads shall not be considered a part of a lot or open space, or front, rear, or side yard for the purpose of meeting yard requirements.

                  Where the owner of a lot at the time of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived does not own sufficient land to enable him to conform to the dimensional requirements of this chapter, such lot may nonetheless be used as a building site, provided that the lot requirements are not reduced below the minimum specified in this chapter by more than 20 percent. If, however, the owner of two or more adjoining lots with insufficient land dimensions, decides to build on or sell off these lots, he must first combine the lots to comply with the dimensional requirements of this chapter. Any lot requiring dimensional waivers below the 20 percent minimum set forth in this section may be approved by the planning and zoning commission and city council upon application and process as a variance, provided that further decreased dimensional requirements shall conform as closely as possible to the required dimensions.

                  (1)	Each principal use shall be located on a lot or parcel which provides frontage on a public street having a right-of-way of not less than 30 feet.

                  (4)	Local streets which will carry less than 600 vehicles per day may have access points as needed to fit the development. Collector streets and arterial streets which are projected to carry more than 600 vehicles per day shall have a minimum distance between access points equal to seven times the speed limit for that street.

                  (l)	Each manufactured home space shall be provided an underground electrical power supply with a properly grounded, waterproofed electrical receptacle with a minimum rated capacity of 150 amperes.
