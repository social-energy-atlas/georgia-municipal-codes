         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Lee County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Randall Dowling, County Administrator, Ms. Terri Lovell, County Clerk, and Mr. James Skipper, Jr., County Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the county may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the county commission to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                  (e)  The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority and the proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds. 
                  (f)  Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
                  (g)  The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds and coupons which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
                  (h)  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required hereunder. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions hereof shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the authority. 
                  (i)  Revenue bonds issued by the authority hereunder shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the State of Georgia or any political subdivision thereof which may contract with said authority. No contracts entered into by the authority with any such political subdivision shall create a debt of such political subdivision of the State of Georgia within the meaning of Ga. Const. art. VII, § VII, ¶ I, but any such political subdivision may obligate itself to pay the payments required under such contracts, as herein set out, from monies received from taxes and from any other source without creating a debt within the meaning of Ga. Const. art. VII, § VII, ¶ I. 
                  (j)  In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies; and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds; and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchasers; and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state or of the United States to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
                  Sec. 7. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as such resolutions or trust indentures may provide. 
                  Sec. 8. - Sinking fund. 
                  The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal of and interest on revenue bonds of the authority, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds, so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of: 
                  (1)  The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due; 
                  (2)  The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; 
                  (3)  The necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest and other investment charges; and 
                  (4)  Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. 
                  The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in the trust indenture, any surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. 
                  Sec. 9. - Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
                  Sec. 10. - Funding and refunding bonds. 
                  The authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of bonds of the authority for the purpose of funding or refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and premium, if any. The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
                  Sec. 11. - Venue and jurisdiction. 
                  Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Dougherty County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to the validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
                  Sec. 12. - Validation. 
                  Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Bond Law of the State of Georgia, as heretofore or hereafter amended. The petition for validation shall also make a party defendant to such action any political subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and any such political subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority issuing the same, and any political subdivision or instrumentality, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said authority. 
                  Sec. 13. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
                  The authority shall have existence for so long as any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, and during such period of time the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds. The authority's existence shall terminate on December 31, 2010, unless at such time there shall be bonds outstanding; in which event the existence shall continue until said bonds are paid in full; provided, however, that in no event shall bonds of any kind be issued after December 31, 2010. 
                  Sec. 14. - Rates, charges and revenues; use. 
                  The authority is hereby authorized to prescribe and fix rates and to revise same from time to time and to collect fees, tolls and charges for the services, facilities and commodities furnished; and in anticipation of the collection of the revenues of such undertaking or project, to issue revenue bonds as herein provided to finance, in whole or in part, the cost of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, betterment or extension of its undertakings or projects; and to pledge to the punctual payment of said bonds, and interest thereon, all or any part of the revenues of such undertaking or project, including the revenues of improvements, betterments or extensions thereto thereafter made. 
                  Sec. 15. - Legal investments. 
                  The bonds herein authorized are hereby made securities in which all public officers and bodies of this state and all political subdivisions, all insurance companies and associations, and other persons carrying on an insurance business, all banks, bankers, trust companies, savings banks, and savings associations, including savings and loan associations, building and loan associations, investment companies, and other persons carrying on a banking business, all administrators, guardians, executors, trustees, and other fiduciaries and all other persons whatsoever who are now or may hereafter be authorized to invest in bonds or other obligations of the state may properly and legally invest funds including capital in their control or belonging to them. The bonds are also hereby made securities which may be deposited with and shall be received by all public officers and bodies of this state and all political subdivisions for any purpose for which the deposit of the bonds or other obligations of this state is now or may hereafter be authorized. 
                  Sec. 16. - Property not subject to levy and sale. 
                  The property of the authority shall not be subject to levy and sale under legal process except such property, revenue, income or funds as may be pledged, assigned, mortgaged or conveyed to secure an obligation of the authority, and any such property, revenue, funds or income may be sold under legal process or under any power granted by the authority to enforce payment of the obligation. 
                  Sec. 17. - Construction. 
                  This act and all provisions, rights, powers and authority granted hereunder, being for the welfare of the state and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of its purposes. 
                  Sec. 18. - Powers declared supplementary. 
                  The provisions of this act shall be regarded as supplementary and additional to powers conferred by other laws and shall not be regarded as being in derogation of any powers now existing. 
                  Sec. 19. - Severability. 
                  The provisions of this act are severable, and if any of its provisions shall be held unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of such court shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions; and, notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative intent, it is hereby declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any provision of this act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remainder of the act and the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby. Insofar as the provisions of this act are inconsistent with the provisions of any other law, the provisions of this act shall be controlling. 
                  Sec. 20. - Effective date. 
                  This act shall be effective immediately upon approval by the governor or upon its becoming law without his approval, without regard to the provisions of 1958 Ga. Laws, page 1364, as amended, codified in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-4.

The board of commissioners of Lee County shall be authorized to remove any member of the authority from office by a two-thirds vote of the board of commissioners of Lee County in the event that such member of the authority is found by the board of commissioners of Lee County to be guilty of misfeasance or malfeasance in office, is found by the board of commissioners of Lee County to have failed to attend three or more successive regular meetings of the authority without a reasonable excuse approved by a resolution of the authority, or who is found by the board of commissioners of Lee County to have engaged in actions or activities which are determined by the board of commissioners of Lee County to have been detrimental to the carrying out of the duties and obligation of the authority.

                  The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which said bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund provided in this act for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. 
                  Sec. 11. - Same; interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
                  Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary bonds with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
                  Sec. 12. - Same; replacement of lost or mutilated bonds. 
                  The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
                  Sec. 13. - Conditions precedent to issuance; object of issuance. 
                  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified or required by this act. In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
                  Sec. 14. - Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Lee County or a pledge of the faith and credit of Lee County, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund provided for in this act and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for the payment thereof, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
                  Sec. 15. - Same; trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
                  Sec. 16. - Same; to whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who or any agency, bank, or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes of this act, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
                  Sec. 17. - Same; sinking fund. 
                  The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued unless otherwise pledged and allocated may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of: 
                  (1)  The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due; 
                  (2)  The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; 
                  (3)  The necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest; and 
                  (4)  Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as provided in this act. 
                  The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued. 
                  Sec. 18. - Same; remedies of bondholders. 
                  Except to the extent of the rights provided in this act, any holder of revenue bonds or any of the coupons appertaining thereto issued under the provisions of this act and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture and may either at law or in equity or by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted by this act or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
                  Sec. 19. - Same; refunding bonds. 
                  The authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issue of revenue refunding bonds of the authority for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon. The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
                  Sec. 20. - Same; venue and jurisdiction. 
                  Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Lee County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
                  Sec. 21. - Same; validation. 
                  Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the "Revenue Bond Law," O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the water system or other utilities for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and such municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds against the authority issuing the same, and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality, contracting with the said Lee County Utilities Authority. 
                  Sec. 22. - Same; interest of bondholders protected. 
                  While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
                  Sec. 23. - Moneys received considered trust funds. 
                  All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, fees, and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this act.

                  Without limiting the generality of any provisions of this act, the general purpose of the authority is declared to be that of acquiring, constructing, operating, and maintaining self-liquidating projects embracing sources of water supply and the distribution and sale of water and related facilities to individuals, private concerns, and municipal corporations; the acquisition, construction, equipping, operation, and maintenance of sewerage facilities useful and necessary for the gathering of waste matter, and the treatment of sewage of any and every type, including, but not limited to, the acquisition and construction of treatment ponds, plants, and lagoons and additions and improvements to and extensions of such facilities within and outside the territorial boundaries of Lee County so as to assure an adequate sewerage system, to operate and maintain the distribution and sale of cable television services and natural gas to individuals, private concerns, and municipal corporations; but such general purpose shall not restrict the authority from selling and delivering such utilities directly to consumers in the unincorporated areas of Lee County. 
                  Sec. 25. - Rates, charges, and revenues; use. 
                  The authority is authorized to prescribe, fix, and collect rates, fees, tolls, or charges and to revise from time to time the same for the services, facilities, or commodities furnished and, in anticipation of the collection of the revenues of such undertaking or project, to issue revenue bonds as provided in this act to finance in whole or in part the cost of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvements, betterment, or extension of the water utility system and other utilities and to pledge to the punctual payment of said bonds and interest thereon all or any part of the revenues of such undertaking or project, including the revenues of improvements, betterments, or extensions thereto thereafter made. 
                  Sec. 26. - Rules and regulations for operation of projects.

                  Sec. 28. - Powers declared supplemental and additional. 
                  The foregoing sections of this act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized by this act and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing. 
                  Sec. 29. - Liberal construction of act. 
                  This act, being for the welfare of various political subdivisions of the state and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes of this act.

                  The provisions of this act are severable and, if any of its provisions shall be held unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decisions of such court shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions. 
                  Sec. 31. - Repeal. 
                  This act does not in any way take from Lee County or any municipality located therein the authority to own, operate, and maintain utility systems or issue revenue certificates as is provided by O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq., the "Revenue Bond Law." All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are repealed.

The percentage needed to be charged against the total ad valorem property taxes collected for Board of Education purposes to reach the dollar amount share of the actual previous fiscal year expenditures of the tax commissioner's office attributable to the collection of ad valorem property taxes for Board of Education purposes shall be the percentage of funds to be retained and then remitted in the current fiscal year as provided in subsection (a) of this section.

                  Sec. 1. - Title.

                  Sec. 2. - Created. 
                  (a)  There is created a body corporate and politic to be known as the Lee County Parks and Recreation Authority, which shall be deemed to be a political subdivision of the state and a public corporation. By that name, style, and title, said body may contract and be contracted with; sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded, complain and defend in all courts of law and equity, except that the authority or the trustee acting under the trust indenture shall in no event be liable for any torts committed by any of the officers, agents, and employees. The authority shall not be a state institution nor a department or agency of the state but shall be an instrumentality of the state, a mere creation of the state, having a distinct corporate entity and being exempt from the provisions of O.C.G.A. tit. 50, ch. 17, art. 2, the "Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission Act." The authority shall have its principal office in the county and its legal situs or residence for the purposes of this division shall be the county. The scope of the authority's operation shall be limited to the territory embraced within the county. The authority is granted the same exemptions and exclusions from taxes as are now granted to cities and counties for the operation of facilities similar to facilities to be operated by the authority as provided under the provisions of this division. 
                  (b)  The authority shall consist of five members appointed by a majority vote of the board of commissioners of the county, any of whom may be members of such governing authority, and the county manager, who shall be an ex officio, nonvoting member of the authority. Members of the county parks and recreation authority shall be appointed for terms of two years, and members may succeed themselves in office. If a member of a governing authority is appointed as a member of the authority, his or her term shall terminate at the end of his or her term of office on the governing authority or upon his or her ceasing to be a member of the governing authority. Such person may be reappointed as a member of the authority. 
                  (c)  The members of the authority shall enter upon their duties immediately upon the next scheduled meeting following their appointment. 
                  (d)  (1)  Any vacancy on the authority shall be filled in the same manner as was the original appointment of the member whose termination of membership resulted in such vacancy, and the person so selected and appointed shall serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. 
                  (2)  Any member of the authority may be removed from office by a majority vote of the appointing entity for failure to perform his or her duties as a member of the authority. Such failure shall include without limitation absence from four consecutive meetings of the authority, unless excused by reasonable grounds as determined by a majority of the members of the authority. Any office so vacated shall be filled within 60 days by appointment as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection. The new appointee shall serve the remainder of the unexpired term to which he or she is appointed. 
                  (e)  Each January, the authority shall elect one of its members as chairperson, one of its members as vice chairperson, and one of its members as secretary and treasurer. Such officers shall serve terms of one year. 
                  (f)  Three members of the authority shall constitute a quorum. No vacancy on the authority shall impair the right of the quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the authority. 
                  (g)  The authority shall make rules and regulations for its own government according to Robert's Rules of Order. It shall have perpetual existence. 
                  (h)  No member or employee of the authority shall have, directly or indirectly, any financial interest, profit, or benefit in any contract, work, or business of the authority nor in the sale, lease, or purchase of any property to or from the authority. 
                  (i)  All meetings of the authority shall be open to the public as provided in O.C.G.A tit. 50, ch. 14.

                  (Act No. 658, § 5, eff. 5-17-04) 
                  Sec. 6. - Same—Public and governmental purpose of; exemption from taxation.

The issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof, including the county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. However, the county or any other political subdivision of the state contracting with the authority may obligate itself to pay the amounts required under any contract entered into with the authority from funds received from taxes to be levied and collected for that purpose to the extent necessary to pay the obligations contractually incurred under this section and from any other source; and the obligation to make such payments shall constitute a general obligation and a pledge of the full faith and credit of the obligor but shall not constitute a debt of the obligor within the meaning of Article IX, Section V, Paragraph I of the Constitution of the State of Georgia. When such obligation is made to make such payments from taxes to be levied for that purpose, then the obligation shall be mandatory to levy and collect such taxes from year to year in an amount sufficient to fulfill and fully comply with the terms of such obligation. Without limiting the obligations of any political subdivision of the state contracting with the authority in accordance with this division, it shall be required that prior to entering into any such contract, the authority or the political subdivision with which such contract will be executed shall prepare or cause to be prepared a feasibility study including a projection of revenues for the project which is the subject of such contract. The political subdivision entering into a contract with the authority shall, prior to entering into the contract, properly advertise its intention and call at least one public hearing on the subject at least three weeks prior to the date on which the political subdivision plans to vote to approve the signing of the contract.

Such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which may include funds received from one or more or all sources, may be set aside at regular intervals into sinking funds for which provision may be made in any such resolution or trust indenture and which may be pledged to and charged with the payment of the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall become due; the principal of the bonds as the same shall mature; the necessary charges of any trustee or agent of paying such principal and interest; and any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase. The use and disposition of any sinking fund may be subject to such regulation as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture securing the payment of the same.

                  Sec. 12. - Immunity and exemption from liability. 
                  The authority shall have the same immunity and exemption from liability for torts and negligence as the state, and the officers, agents, and employees of the authority, when in performance of the work of the authority, shall have the same immunity from liability for torts and negligence as officers, agents, and employees of the state. The authority may be sued the same as private corporations on any contractual obligation of the authority. The property of the authority shall not be subject to levy and sale under legal process.

                  Bonds issued by the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 82, art. 3, the "Revenue Bond Law." The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the state or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the state or the United States government or any department or agency of the United States government, if subject to being sued and if consenting to same, which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and the state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as part of the basis of the security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority.

                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  Sec. 2-260. - Disposition of county surplus property. 
                  (a)  Purpose. This section establishes standards and guidelines for the disposition of county property. This section is designed to ensure that disposition of county property is handled in a consistent and efficient manner. 
                  (b)  Declaration of property as surplus prior to sale.

                  (c)  General disposition requirements. County property shall not be sold or exchanged for less than its fair market value. Sale of excess county property shall be made in the following manner: 
                  (1)  Property valued less than $250.00. If the estimated sales value of the property offered for sale is less than $250.00, the county manager may negotiate a sale in the open market after such informal inquiry as he considers necessary to ensure a fair return to the county. The sale shall be documented by an appropriate bill of sale. 
                  (2)  Property valued from $250.00 to $1,000.00. For sale of property with an estimated value of from $250.00 to $1,000.00, the county manager shall solicit informal bids orally, by telephone, or in writing from all known prospective purchasers, and a tabulation on all such bids received shall be retained as part of the permanent record. The sale shall be documented by an appropriate bill of sale. 
                  (3)  Property valued in excess of $1,000.00. A sale of property with an estimated value of $1,000.00 or more and the award of such contract shall be made only after advertising for formal bids. Such advertising shall be at least 15 days prior to the award of a sale contract and shall be by advertisement in a newspaper or circular letters to all prospective purchasers. Bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place specified in the advertisement. A tabulation of all bids received shall be prepared and filed with the contract as a part of the permanent record. The award shall be made to the highest bidder as to price, and the sale shall be documented by an appropriate bill of sale. 
                  (d)  Alternate disposition procedures. 
                  (1)  As an alternative to the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, county property may be sold at the value authorized, at county public auction, to the public at its fair market value. The county manager shall make every effort to sell excess property as outlined in subsection (c) of this section; but if the property has no scrap or salvage value and a purchaser cannot be found, a statement shall be prepared by the county manager listing the prospective bidders solicited and all other efforts made to sell the property. This statement shall be referred to the board of commissioners for their authority to destroy, abandon, or otherwise dispose of such property. 
                  (2)  As an alternative to the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, and as an alternative to the requirements of subsection (d)(1) of this section, surplus county property may also be sold through the use of websites on the internet that specialize in the sale of surplus governmental property to the public. At the time that county property is declared as surplus by the board of commissioners under this section, in the event that the board desires to authorize the sale of such property through such internet websites, it shall advise the county manager of such authority. In the event that such authority is provided to the county manager to sell county surplus on such websites, the county manager shall select the appropriate website to be utilized for such sale that, in the determination of the county manager, will provide a sale in the best interest of the county. Unless expressly approved by the board of commissioners, the fee to be paid by the county in connection with the sale of the property through such internet websites shall not exceed ten percent of the sales price of the surplus sold. Any funds from such sale shall be deposited into the general fund of the county. 
                  (e)  Certain bidders prohibited from bidding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no elected official, appointed official, full-time county employee, part-time county employee, or the immediate family of any of such persons, shall be authorized to bid or purchase county surplus property under the terms of this section. For purposes of this section, the term "immediate family" shall include husband, wife, children, mother, father, brother, or sister, whether or not living in the same household. 
                  (f)  State law authority. Nothing herein shall prohibit the board of commissioners from authorizing the sale, conveyance or transfer of real or personal property owned by the county in a manner authorized or required by applicable state law, but in no event shall any person referred to in subsection (e) of this section be authorized to purchase such county property even where such property is disposed of under applicable state law.

                  Sec. 2-261. - Waiver of bid requirements for purchases of used equipment for a purchase price not exceeding $50,000.00. 
                  Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, the governing body shall be authorized, by a majority vote, to waive the solicitation of bids for any purchases of used equipment in amounts not exceeding $50,000.00 if the following requirements with respect to such proposed purchase are met: 
                  (1)  The equipment to be purchased is used; 
                  (2)  The equipment to be purchased is in such condition that it may be, upon delivery, immediately put in operation by the county department to which such equipment is assigned without substantial repairs; 
                  (3)  The used equipment must be either offered for sale directly by another governmental entity, by or through an online bid site used primarily by governmental entities for the sale of used equipment, or from a private vendor; 
                  (4)  It must be verified prior to approval of the purchase that the purchase price is consistent with current market prices of similar used equipment as established by recent sales, published valuations, and other verifiable sources of price information; 
                  (5)  There must be a determination by the board of commissioners that there is an immediate necessity for the purchase of such equipment so that requiring normal bid processes would potentially jeopardize the public health or safety; 
                  (6)  The purchase price of the used equipment does not exceed $50,000.00. 
                  No purchase of used equipment shall be divided into its component parts in an attempt to meet the $50,000.00 purchase price limit under this section. 
                  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no purchase of used equipment shall be authorized unless funds for such purchase have been appropriated in the current annual county budget.

                  Sec. 10-31. - Findings; public purpose. 
                  The board of commissioners finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to enact regulations to reduce the possible adverse impacts of adult entertainment businesses. However, the board of commissioners also finds that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon protected forms of expression. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to establish a balance between the protections afforded by the First Amendment and the public health, safety and welfare of the citizenry of the county and reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate government interest of reducing criminal activity and protecting property values without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons.

The animal control office shall have a minimum of one day and a maximum of ten days to appear before the Magistrate Court to prove the finding of abuse and request that the court transfer ownership of the animal to the county for either disposal and or adoption. Written notice to the owner of the animal, if known, or if ascertainable through the reasonable diligence of the animal control officer, shall be provided by the animal control officer at least 24 hours prior to the date and time of the hearing. However, the failure to provide such notice shall not prohibit the court from entering such orders as the court may deem necessary where the court determines that an emergency situation exists with respect to a particular animal or animals.

Failure to submit such books or records within the 30-day period shall be grounds for revocation of the tax registration currently existing to do business in the county. Adequate records shall be kept in the county for examination by the revenue collection agent at that officer's discretion. If after examination of the books and records it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of underreporting, a penalty of $150.00 shall be assessed for the period delinquent.

                  Failure of any person to pay an applicable administrative fee, regulatory fee, occupation tax, or any part of a tax, before it becomes delinquent, or upon the failure to permit inspection of books as required, shall result in any business tax certificates or regulatory fee certificates granted by the county under this article permitting such person to do business in the unincorporated areas of the county for the current year being automatically revoked without any further action required of the county. No new occupation tax certificate or regulatory fee certificate shall be granted by the county for the operation of a business for which any part of the occupation tax or fees required in this article are unpaid, nor shall such certificates be issued to a person who has failed to submit adequate records for inspection as required by section 22-54.

In the case of those practitioners where the local government cannot suspend the right of the practitioner to conduct business, the imposition of civil penalties shall be permitted and pursued by the local government as in the case of a delinquent occupation tax. These penalties shall consist of either ten percent of the amount due or a fine of $50.00, whichever is less, as determined by the revenue collection agency.

The lien shall cover the property in the unincorporated areas of the county of the person liable for the tax, all as provided by ordinances of the county and the laws of the state. The lien for the occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time that such tax or installment becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the sheriff upon the property of the defendant located in such jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of the execution, with interest and costs added. All other related proceedings shall be as provided by ordinances of the county and the laws of the state; and the defendants at execution shall have the rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality of the tax or otherwise as provided by the applicable laws of the state in regard to tax executions.

If at any time after the entry of the nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution pays the tax in full, together with all interest penalties and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges for services and goods due the person as though the person had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

                  (4)  Applicant's proposed antenna(s) would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing tower or structure. 
                  (5)  That the cost or contractual provisions required by the tower owner to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
                  (6)  Such other limiting factor(s) as may be demonstrated by the applicant. 
                  All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts. Such evidence shall be subject to independent verification by an engineer of the county's choosing. 
                  (d)  Setbacks. Setbacks for towers and above-ground transmission facilities shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  All transmission facilities, except buried portions, shall be set back from all adjoining properties zoned non-residential the distance required for that zoning district. 
                  (2)  When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, the tower and entire transmission facility must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance equal to the height of the tower. 
                  (e)  Unless otherwise specified by the planning director or his/her designee, towers shall be enclosed by vinyl chain link security fencing or other approved alternative not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. 
                  (f)  All new towers in excess of 100 feet which do not incorporate alternative design features must be designed and built in a manner that allows other entities to co-locate on the structures using the following guidelines: 
                  Maximum Telecommunications Tower Heights 

                   
                  (g)  All towers and their related structures shall maximize the use of building materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that, in the opinion of the planning director or his/her designee, effectively blend the tower facilities within the surrounding natural setting and built environment. Where appropriate, towers shall be painted so as to reduce their visual obtrusiveness, subject to any applicable standards of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
                  (h)  If upon receipt of an application for the erection of any tower or alternative tower structure governed by this article, the planning director or his/her designee deems that the proposed structure may interfere with the use of the airways of the county by the public or interfere with the operation of existing or proposed airport facilities, a copy of the application shall be submitted by the planning and zoning department to the airport division of the department of transportation for review and recommendation.

                  (1)  Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the county provided accessory structures are located underground where technically feasible and a license, permit or lease authorizing such tower is thereafter approved by the county. 
                  (2)  Installing an antenna on an existing structure, so long as said installation is considered to be a stealth technology installation that does not significantly change the profile of the existing structure and so that the installation is not readily noticeable to the untrained eye. Such installations including cables leading to the antennas shall be painted to match the paint and colors on the existing structure and shall not protrude from the existing structure in a noticeable fashion. 
                  (3)  Co-location by installing an antenna on any existing tower or alternative tower structure. 
                  (4)  Replacing an existing tower with a new tower designed to accommodate two or more users so long as such new tower does not exceed the height limitations of subsection 28-30(f) and setback requirements of this article are met. After the replacement tower is built only one tower shall remain on such site. Support equipment shall, where technically feasible, be located underground. 
                  (5)  Locating any alternative tower structures (manmade trees, clock towers, bell steeples, or light poles that, based on staff determination, effectively camouflage or conceal towers and antennas) provided accessory structures are located underground where technically feasible or otherwise incorporated into the alternative structure. 
                  (6)  Installing any antenna or tower not to exceed the limitations contained in subsection 28-30(f) and provided accessory structures are located underground where technically feasible or shielded to the satisfaction of the planning director or his/her designee. 
                  If the planning director or his/her designee determine that any application for an administratively approved use does not meet the general application requirements, development requirements and/or standards enumerated herein, administrative approval of the application shall be denied provided substantial evidence exists to support such denial. Such evidence shall be summarized for the applicant along with a recommendation as to whether the applicant should pursue a variance or proceed to a public hearing as specified in subsection (b) below. Applicants may appeal the administrative denial to the county board of commissioners pursuant to the procedures described in article XX, policies and procedures, section 70-689, public hearing process, of the zoning chapter. Any other party aggrieved by the decision of the planning director or his/her designee may file an appeal to the board of commissioners including payment of the filing fee. For purposes of this section an aggrieved party is one who demonstrates that his or her property will suffer special damage as a result of the decision complained of rather than merely some damage that is common to all property owners and citizens similarly situated. 
                  The board of commissioners shall dispense with the appeal by either: 
                  (7)  A determination that the application is valid and meets all applicable criteria for an administratively approved use under this article, which shall result in the issuance of a permit. 
                  (8)  A determination that the application does not satisfy all applicable criteria for an approved administratively use under this article, but, owing to special conditions, a variance as to separation or setback requirements: 
                  a.  Will not be contrary to the public interest; 
                  b.  Will relieve unnecessary hardship; and 
                  c.  Shall preserve the intent and spirit of this article. 
                  (9)  A determination that the application does not satisfy all applicable criteria for an administratively approved use under this article and the deficiencies cannot, subject to the conditions listed above, properly be cured by a variance. 
                  Applications which do not satisfy all applicable criteria must, as a result, apply for a public hearing before the board of commissioners as specified in subsection (b) below. 
                  (b)  Other uses—Public hearing required. 
                  (1)  If the proposed tower or antenna is not included under the above described administratively approved uses, or the application does not on its face satisfy the development standards and other criteria specified herein, then a public hearing before the board of commissioners shall be required for the approval of the construction of a wireless transmission facility in all zoning districts. Applicants shall apply for a public hearing through the planning and zoning department and pay the required fee at such time. Applications, when complete, shall be placed on the next available agenda of the board of commissioners. At least 30 days prior to any scheduled hearing, the planning and zoning department shall cause a sign to be posted on the property and the publication of a public notice in a newspaper of general circulation. Said notice shall state the nature of the application, street location of the proposal and height of the proposed structure. 
                  (2)  Before approving an application for an "other use," the governing authority may impose conditions to the extent necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. The factors considered in granting such a permit include those enumerated in sections 28-29 and 28-30. The board of commissioners may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria, if, in their discretion doing so will advance the goals of this article as stated in section 28-26.

                  (a)  All wireless transmission facilities and related landscaping shall be maintained by the facility owner in good condition, order, and repair so that they shall not endanger the life or property of any person, nor shall they be a blight upon the property. 
                  (b)  To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the applicant of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the county concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice to the applicant, said applicant shall have 15 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. If the applicant fails to bring the tower into compliance within the 15 days, the county may remove the tower at the applicant's expense. Prior to removal of any tower, the county may consider detailed plans submitted by the applicant for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above referenced compliance period. Any such removal by the county shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A., §§ 41-2-7—41-2-17. 
                  (c)  All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the county shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A., §§ 41-2-7—41-2-17. 
                  (d)  All maintenance or construction on wireless transmission facilities shall be performed by persons employed by or under contract to the owner between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday except in cases of emergency. Access to facilities on county owned property shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the department responsible for such property. The hours of access to county sites shall not exceed those specified above. Persons may not be present on site unless performing construction or maintenance at such site. 
                  (e)  The owner or user of any telecommunications facility shall be required to submit a "facility in use certification" annually to the license and permits department. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months or is not properly maintained shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same and any structures housing supporting equipment within 90 days of receipt of notice from the governing authority of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed or returned to good condition within said 90 days, the governing authority may remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.

                  Recognizing that the board of commissioners is under no obligation to grant a facilities lease for the use of county property, the board of commissioners shall strive to consider and take action on application for facilities leases within 60 days after receiving a complete application for such a lease. When such action is taken, the board of commissioners or their designee shall issue a written determination granting or denying the lease in whole or in part, applying the standards set forth below, or any other such criteria as the board of commissioners may choose to apply. If the lease application is denied, the determination shall include the reason for denial following review of these factors:

                  The board of commissioners has previously entered into leases with other tenants for their equipment and wireless transmission facilities. Lessee acknowledges that the board of commissioners is also leasing the county property for the purposes of transmitting and receiving telecommunications signals from the county property. The board of commissioners, however, is not in any way responsible or liable for any interference with lessee's use of the county property which may be caused by the use and operation of any other tenant's equipment, even if caused by new technology. In the event that any other tenant's activities interfere with the lessee's use of the county property, and the lessee cannot work out this interference with the other tenants, the lessee may, upon 30 days' notice to the board of commissioners, terminate this lease and restore the county property to its original condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. The lessee shall cooperate with all other tenants to identify the causes of and work towards the resolution of any electronic interference problem. In addition, the lessee agrees to eliminate any radio or television interference caused to county-owned facilities or surrounding residences at Lessee's own expense and without installation of extra filters on county-owned equipment. Lessee further agrees to accept such interference as may be received from county operated telecommunications or other facilities located upon the county property subject to this lease.

In the event that the board of commissioners requires removal of such improvements, such removal shall be accomplished at the sole expense of the lessee and completed within 90 days after receiving notice from the county manager requiring removal of the improvements. In the event that wireless transmission facilities or other equipment are left upon county property after expiration or termination of the lease, they shall become the property of the board of commissioners, unless otherwise notified. The board of commissioners may require removal of wireless transmission facilities or other equipment by the lessee upon 30 days written notice from the county manager.

Such compensation shall be payable in advance of the effective date of the lease and on or before January 31 of each calendar year. Any payments received after the due date shall include a late payment penalty of two percent of the annual rental fee for each day or part thereof past the due date. The compensation shall be negotiated by the county manager or designee, subject to the board of commissioner's final approval, based on the following criteria: 
                  (1)  Comparable lease rates for other public or private property. 
                  (2)  In the case land is leased, an appraisal opinion upon which the land and air space is rented.

                  Editor's note— Ord. of July, 11, 2006, pertaining to development impact fees regulations, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion herein as a new Ch. 29 was at the discretion of the editor. See also the Code Comparative Table for a detailed analysis of inclusion.

                  (b)  Authority. This chapter has been prepared and adopted by the board of commissioners in accordance with the authority provided by Article 9, Section 2, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, the Georgia Development Impact Fee Act (O.C.G.A. 36-71-1 et seq. as amended), and such other laws as may apply to the provision of public facilities and the power to charge fees for such facilities. 
                  (c)  Applicability. 
                  (1)  The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to limit the power of the county to use any other legal methods or powers otherwise available for accomplishing the purposes set forth herein, either in substitution of or in conjunction with this chapter.

                  Sec. 29-2. - Findings, purpose, and intent. 
                  (a)  Findings. The board of commissioners finds and declares: 
                  (1)  That an equitable program for planning and financing public facilities to serve new growth and development is necessary in order to promote and accommodate orderly growth and development and to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Lee County; and 
                  (2)  That certain public facilities as herein defined have been and must be further expanded if new growth and development is to be accommodated at the same level of service available to existing development; and 
                  (3)  That it is fair and equitable that new growth and development shall bear a proportionate share of the cost of such public facilities necessary to serve new growth and development. 
                  (b)  Purpose. 
                  (1)  The purpose of this chapter is to impose impact fees, as hereinafter set forth, for certain public facilities, as hereinafter defined. 
                  (2)  It is also the purpose of this chapter to ensure that adequate public facilities are available to serve new growth and development in the county and to provide that new growth and development bears a proportionate share of the cost of new public facilities needed to serve them. 
                  (c)  Intent. This chapter is intended to implement and be consistent with the Lee County Comprehensive Plan, as it may be adopted or amended in accord with the Georgia Comprehensive Planning Act (O.C.G.A. 50-8-1 et seq.); and the applicable minimum standards and procedures for local comprehensive planning and the development impact fee compliance requirements, both as adopted by the Georgia Board of Community Affairs and amended from time to time.

                  (a)  Construction not subject to impact fees. The following projects and construction activities do not constitute "development" as defined in this chapter, and are therefore not subject to the imposition of impact fees: 
                  (1)  Rebuilding no more than the same number of units of development as defined in this chapter that were removed by demolition, or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe, on the same lot or property.

                  (1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, that portion of a project for which a valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall not be subject to development impact fees so long as the permit remains valid and construction is commenced and is pursued according to the terms of the permit. 
                  (2)  Any building for which a valid and complete application for a building permit has been received prior to the effective date of this chapter may proceed without payment of fees otherwise imposed by this chapter, provided that: 
                  a.  All fees and development exactions in effect prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be or have been paid in full; and, 
                  b.  Said construction shall be commenced, pursued and completed within the time established by the building permit, or within 180 days, whichever is later. 
                  (c)  Method of calculation. 
                  (1)  Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this chapter shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (2)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, the calculation of impact fees shall be net of credits for the present value of ad valorem taxes or other revenues as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and which: 
                  a.  Are reasonably expected to be generated by new growth and development; and 
                  b.  Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed. 
                  (3)  The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this chapter shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of Lee County, Georgia, and may be amended from time to time by official act. 
                  (4)  In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (5)  Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.

                  Sec. 29-5. - Fee assessment and payment. 
                  (a)  Fee schedule. 
                  (1)  Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment A [codified at the end of this chapter] for a property located inside of Lee County, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by the county, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (2)  When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. 
                  (3)  In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then: 
                  a.  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee. 
                  b.  In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule. 
                  c.  If a land use designation is not in a category contained in this chapter, then an appropriate new category may be added by the administrator and an appropriate fee established under the county's current impact fee methodology, subject to annual confirmation by the board of commissioners. 
                  d.  Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Timing of assessment and payment. 
                  (1)  Development impact fees shall be assessed at the time of application for a building permit. 
                  (2)  All development impact fees shall be collected no earlier than the time of issuance of a building permit, and no later than as a prerequisite to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building. 
                  (3)  For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property. 
                  (4)  If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy. An adjustment may result in a refund to the feepayor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid. 
                  (5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit. 
                  (c)  Individual assessment determinations. Individual assessments of development impact fees may be established as follows: 
                  (1)  At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project in lieu of the fee established on the fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment A. 
                  (2)  In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. Each individual assessment study shall: 
                  a.  Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data; or, 
                  b.  Be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in the county or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to accepted methodology; and, 
                  c.  Provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination. 
                  (3)  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this chapter. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this chapter. 
                  (4)  Any fee approved as an individual assessment determination shall have standing for 180 days following the date of approval. Payment of such an approved individual assessment determination shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by the county, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (d)  Fee certification. Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certification of the development impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment A or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable.

                  Sec. 29-6. - Exemptions. 
                  (a)  Exemption policy. The board of commissioners finds that certain office, retail trade or industrial uses that create unusually high investment, economic or job creation benefits represent extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the county in proportion to the creation of such benefits. To encourage such development projects, the board of commissioners may consider granting a reduction in the impact fee for such a development project upon the determination and relative to the extent that the business or project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the county, in accordance with adopted exemption criteria. It is also recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees. 
                  (b)  Process for exemption approval. An application for exemption shall be considered under the following procedures: 
                  (1)  Application for exemption approval must be made by the building permit applicant to the administrator. A building permit may be issued upon approval of an exemption, or may be issued without payment of applicable impact fees following receipt of a complete exemption application and pending its approval, but a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until a decision regarding the exemption has been made, or until such time that the application for exemption is otherwise withdrawn by the applicant and payment of impact fees have been paid. 
                  (2)  Documentation must be provided to the administrator that demonstrates the applicant's eligibility for an exemption. This documentation shall address, but need not be limited to, all applicable exemption criteria adopted by the county. This documentation constitutes the application for exemption. 
                  (3)  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall determine whether an application for exemption addresses the exemption criteria adopted by the county and is complete. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this chapter. 
                  (4)  The administrator or the board of commissioners shall determine the eligibility for and extent of exemption, in accordance with the standards and procedures contained in the exemption criteria adopted by the board of commissioners. If action by the board of commissioners is required, the application for exemption shall be considered at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners that falls at least two weeks after a complete application for exemption has been received by the administrator.

                  b.  Any portion of an impact fee collected as a repayment for expenditures made by the county for system improvements intended to be funded by such impact fee; and,

                  a.  The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive land use plan; 
                  b.  The amount of the credit does not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding, as shown in the capital improvements element; and, 
                  c.  The board of commissioners shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction, dedication, or transfer. 
                  (2)  The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is authorized under a private agreement executed under the provisions of section 29-9 of this chapter.

                  (1)  For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated. 
                  (2)  For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated. 
                  (3)  For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that the county would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less. 
                  (4)  For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest accepted by the county, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated. 
                  (5)  In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a State of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the board of commissioners in its sole discretion may deem appropriate. 
                  (d)  Credits; application. 
                  (1)  Credits shall be given only upon written request of the developer to the administrator. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment.

                  (3)  In no event shall a feepayor be entitled to a refund for impact fees assessed and paid to recover the cost of excess capacity in existing system improvements, for any portion of an impact fee collected as a repayment for expenditures made by the county for system improvements intended to be funded by such impact fee, or for that portion of the fee payment that was assessed for administration of the impact fee ordinance or for recovery of the cost of preparation of the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (e)  No development impact fees previously paid by any person or entity prior to the effective date of this chapter that was required to be paid in accord with the Lee County Development Impact Fee Ordinance shall be subject to refund to such person or entity solely by virtue of the adoption of this ordinance or the amendment thereto.

The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful. 
                  (d)  Demolition. If the public officer has the structure demolished in accord with an order from the magistrate court, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition.

An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this division. 
                  (b)  County may release lien; owner's contract to rehabilitate structure. Lee County may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with Lee County agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.

                  DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

                  Sec. 34-216. - Statutory authorization. 
                  The Legislature of the state has in Georgia Code Annotated, Article IX, Section II, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the board of commissioners does ordain as follows. 
                  (Ord. of 8-27-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-217. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Lee County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 8-27-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-218. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 8-27-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-219. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Sec. 34-220. - Restrictions on developments in floodplain. 
                  In all special flood hazard areas (SFHA) as shown on the [flood] insurance rate maps (FIRM), the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  New construction of principal buildings (both residential and nonresidential), including manufactured homes, shall not be allowed if any portion of the structure lies within the limits of the "floodway." 
                  (2)  All structures to be located within the 100-year zone "AE" floodplain boundaries or 500-year gray shaded zone "X" floodplain boundaries immediately adjacent to the 100-year zone "AE" shall have approved plans for the construction of such structure that evidences that such structure shall be located upon a lot having a minimum of two acres of land legally subdivided prior to a building permit being issued. All structures located in the 100-year zone "AE" floodplain boundaries shall have the first finished floor elevated to at least three feet above the 100-year base flood elevation. All structures located in the 500-year gray shaded zone "X" floodplain boundaries immediately adjacent to the 100-year zone "AE" shall have the first finished floor elevated to at least one foot above the 100-year zone "AE" base flood elevation. An official elevation certificate shall be submitted at time of building permit application attesting to the fact that the finished floor elevation shall be at least at or above the required elevation. 
                  Exemption: An owner of any lot already legally subdivided and approved by October 1, 2005 will be allowed to apply for a building permit under the relevant applicable provisions for construction on such lot that were applicable immediately prior to October 1, 2005. If a building permit is issued under the provisions of this exemption, a structure may be built in the floodplain under such provisions relating to such construction as were applicable immediately prior to October 1, 2005, providing the construction meets all of the other requirements for then-existing development procedures for construction under the floodplain development ordinance of the county.

The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure.) (NOTE: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  c.  Design certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that any proposed nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing criteria of subsection 34-247(2) of this Code; and 
                  d.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
                  (2)  Construction stage. For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit holder shall provide to the administrator an as-built certification of the regulatory floor elevation or floodproofing level immediately after the lowest floor or floodproofing is completed. Any lowest floor certification made relative to mean sea level shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. When floodproofing is utilized for nonresidential structures, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. 
                  Any work undertaken prior to submission of these certifications shall be at the permit holder's risk. 
                  The zoning administrator shall review the above referenced certification data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit certification or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.

                  DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 34-246. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  (b)  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  (c)  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. of 8-27-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-247. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than three feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-246(4). 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 34-243(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (ref. subsection 34-246(6) above). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 90 consecutive days, 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)(a) and (c), above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-228, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)(a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.

                  Sec. 34-248. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-Zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-228, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 34-228, then the zoning administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections (2), (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-247(4). 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The zoning administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Sec. 34-249. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO-Zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-228, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-246(4). 
                  The zoning administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 34-242(1)(c) and (2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of commissioners may appeal such decision to Lee County Superior Court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this section are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  ARTICLE VII. - STREAM BUFFER PROTECTION PLAN 

                  Sec. 34-270. - [Generally.] 
                  (a)  Purpose and applicability. In 1991, the General Assembly passed the Mountain and River Corridor Protection Act, which called for the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to develop criteria for the protection of important river corridors within the State of Georgia. These criteria apply to all perennial rivers or streams with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second (as defined by the United States Geologic Survey). In December 1991, the Board of Natural Resources adopted these river corridor protection criteria. A subsequent amendment of the Minimum Planning Standards and Procedures for Local Comprehensive Planning (approved by the board of community affairs in April 1992), requires all local governments to address these river corridor protection criteria within their comprehensive plans as they apply to rivers and streams in their municipal boundaries. Lee County has adopted a more stringent requirement for stream flows to include all streams and creeks with flows of 300 cubic feet per minute or greater. Within Lee County, the Flint River and Kinchafoonee Creek and the Muckalee Creek are subject to the river corridor protection criteria referred to hereafter as the "stream buffer protection plan." 
                  The primary purposes of the stream buffer protection plan criteria are to protect water quality, reduce erosion, encourage the protection of wildlife habitats, and reduce the risk of flood damage to properties near major rivers. Therefore, the protection criteria require the establishment and maintenance of a 100-foot natural vegetative buffer, containing flora and fauna native to the area. The 100-foot wide buffer, consisting of the area between the top of the bank 1 and the edge of the river's low water line shall be included within the stream buffer protection plan. 
                  Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, riverbank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these criteria, the stream corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period of local comprehensive plans. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review by the department of community affairs. 
                  (b)  Permissible uses. 
                  (1)  Land use existing prior to the promulgation of a stream buffer protection plan. 
                  (2)  Single-family dwellings, including the usual appurtenances, are permitted within the buffer area, subject to the following conditions: 
                  a.  The dwelling shall be in compliance with all local zoning regulations. 
                  b.  No more than one dwelling shall be located on a tract of land containing at least two acres, not including any area that lies within the river corridor or within the boundaries of the "floodway" as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and delineated on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) panels. 
                  c.  A septic tank serving such a dwelling may be located within the buffer area. 
                  d.  Septic tank drain fields shall not be located within the buffer area. 
                  (c)  Construction of road crossings and utility crossings provided that construction of such road and utility crossings shall meet all requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act of 1975, and of any applicable local ordinances on soil erosion and sedimentation control. 
                  (d)  Timber production and harvesting are subject to the following conditions: 
                  (1)  Forestry activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry Commission; and 
                  (2)  Forestry activity shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - WETLAND PROTECTION CRITERIA 

                  Sec. 34-281. - Purpose and applicability. 
                  The quality of urban and rural streams reflects the quality of land management and land development activities within the watershed. Reducing the amount of disturbance and impervious surfaces adjacent to watercourses is one of the best methods to reduce the quantity of non-point source pollutants in these watercourses and wetlands; this is done by allowing stormwater pollutants to infiltrate the soil before they reach the water resource. Conventional zoning ordinances generally do not mitigate these problems to a sufficient degree, and therefore, are not considerate enough of the impacts on environmental resources, and, in turn, the quality of life and health of the community's residents. 
                  Zoning of the built environment generally requires setbacks for buildings and rights-of-way for streets and roads. However, wetlands and streams do not enjoy the same protection. These resources not only serve natural systems, but directly affect the quality of life of the human environment by providing clean water, a critical element of human health, economy, and general well-being. 
                  These streams and wetlands do not exist apart from their surrounding upland areas. They are intertwined in a dynamic link to create balance in a natural system. Therefore, as part of an overall watershed protection strategy, it is not enough to protect the "wet" areas of wetlands and streams. Protection must also be extended to the contiguous upland areas of those hydric systems as well. 
                  Protection should be provided all natural streams and wetlands in Lee County. Streams to be buffered will be identified as the first solid blue line on a 7.5 minute, U.S.G.S. Quadrangle Map. Freshets and intermittent streams will not be included in the ordinance. All jurisdictional wetlands will be buffered, and will be identified by at least one of the following: 
                  (1)  The "Central Dougherty Plain Advance Identification of Wetlands" (U.S. EPA) Draft Technical Summary Document; 
                  (2)  Those wetlands identified by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' documents, or by private contractor, certified in wetland delineation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; 
                  (3)  The National Wetlands Inventory published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
                  (Res. No. LD05-A052, 9-23-2005) 
                  Sec. 34-282. - Buffers and permitted uses. 
                  A lateral, three-tier system shall establish buffer width, and shall permit increasing levels of activities within the stream or wetland buffer zone. These zones are established as follows: 
                  (1)  The "streamside zone" protects the physical and ecological integrity of the stream ecosystem. The vegetative target is mature riparian forest that can provide shade, leaf liner, woody debris and erosion protection to the stream. The width shall be 25 feet (100 feet on rivers with a mean annual flow of 400 cfs or more, per the requirements of the Mountain and River Corridor Protection Act, 1991), measured from each stream bank ("bank" being defined as that adjacent, uppermost part of the land adjacent to the watercourse that serves to contain it). This distance equals about one or two mature tree's growth from the streambank. 
                  Land use in this zone shall be highly restricted, and shall be strictly limited to stormwater channels, footpaths, and a few utility or roadway crossings. In this zone, those areas previously developed or improved will be hereafter undisturbed; vegetation in this zone will be left to develop, eventually creating a mature forest typical of this region and soil conditions. 
                  (2)  The "middle zone" extends from the outward boundary of the streamside zone, and shall be 25 feet wide. The functions of the middle zone is to protect key components of the stream and provide further distance between upland development and the stream. The vegetative target for this zone is also mature forest, but some clearing may be allowed for stormwater management, access, and recreational uses. 
                  A wider range of activities and uses are allowed within this zone, e.g., recreation, bike paths, and stormwater BMPs. 
                  (3)  The "outer zone" can practically be considered the "buffer's buffer," and shall be an additional 25-foot setback from the outer edge of the middle zone to the nearest permanent structure. In most instances, the outer zone will be a residential backyard. The vegetative target for the outer zone is usually turf or lawn. However, the property owner is encouraged to plant trees and shrubs in this area, thereby increasing the total width of the buffer. 
                  Very few uses are restricted in this zone. Gardening, lawns, etc are promoted in this zone, but septic systems and permanent structures are prohibited. 
                  In the event that a landowner disputes a determination by the county concerning buffer width and/or identification of the stream "bank," the property owner has the option of retaining a wetland scientist and/or a certified land surveyor to delineate the buffer widths and distances. Unless the county determines that such determination is invalid, the county shall be bound by such determination.

                  Sec. 34-283. - Hardships. 
                  Property owners may make use of three mitigation options if they feel they have been unduly impacted by the provisions above. The use of any such option shall be approved by the county as part of the permitting process for the development. Such options are as follows: 
                  (1)  Buffer averaging. This approach allows some flexibility in the width of the buffer, as long as the streamside zone is not impacted. Where the width of the buffer must be compromised on one part of the property, the width will be made up in another part; that is, the buffer may be wider at the mitigation point, and narrower at the variance point. 
                  (2)  Density compensation. This method grants a developer a credit for additional density elsewhere on the site, in compensation for developable land that has been lost due to the buffer requirement. Developable land is defined as the portion of buffer area remaining after the wetland, streamside, or steep slope areas has been subtracted. Credits will be granted when more than five percent of developable land is consumed by the buffers. The density credit is accommodated at the development site by allowing greater flexibility in setbacks, frontage distances, or minimum lot sizes to squeeze in "lost lots." For example, if otherwise approved, cluster developments would also allow the developer to recover lots that cannot be used for construction due to buffers. 
                  (3)  Conservation easements. Landowners may be afforded the option of protecting lands within the buffer by means of a perpetual conservation easement. The easement conditions the use of the buffer, and may be donated to a land trust or similar legal entity. Alternatively, the conservation easement can be donated to the county if the county agrees to accept such donation. In order for this provision to become a bona fide option, the county, or some other appropriate agency or legal entity, must organize and continually administer a land trust. 
                  No hardship mitigation option shall be authorized which would result in the violation of the requirements of any development, zoning, or other ordinance of the county.

                  Sec. 34-284. - Appeals. 
                  Property owners may request a variance from these provisions through the process outlined in chapter 70 of the Lee County Code of Ordinances. Applicants for such variance must demonstrate that the applicant will suffer severe economic hardship, or must show the existence unique circumstances applicable only to the subject property, which make it impractical or impossible to meet the buffer requirements. "Severe economic hardship" shall mean that the buffer requirements make the applicant's entire proposed development economically worthless or renders the applicant's property not subject to any type of development.

                  ARTICLE IX. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS 

                  Sec. 34-301. - Criteria for protection of groundwater recharge areas. 
                  (a)  Background. Variable levels of recharge area protection can be based upon the state's hydrogeology (e.g., areas such as the Dougherty Plain where a major aquifer crops out would receive a relatively high degree of protection whereas other areas, such as the shale hills of northwest Georgia, would receive a lower degree of protection). Recharge area protection within the significant recharge areas would be further refined, based upon the local susceptibility or vulnerability to human induced pollution (e.g., high, medium, or low). The significant recharge areas have already been identified and mapped (about 22 to 23 percent of the state). Pollution susceptibility mapping is ongoing. Existing statutes are adequate for protecting the remaining recharge areas (about 77 to 78 percent of the state). 
                  (b)  Definitions: 
                  (1)  Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  (2)  DRASTIC means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Document EPA-600/2-87-035. 
                  (3)  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  (4)  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the Department of Natural Resources, using the DRASTIC methodology. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low ground-water pollution potential. 
                  (5)  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  (6)  Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density or lithologic contacts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. Significant recharge areas are as follows in the various geologic provinces of Georgia: 
                  a.  In the Valley and Ridge and in the Cumberland Plateau, significant recharge areas are outcrop areas of carbonate rock where low slope (less than eight percent slope) conditions prevail. Such areas commonly are characterized by karst topography (caves and sinkholes). 
                  b.  In the Piedmont and in the Blue Ridge, rocks have little primary porosity, with most groundwater being stored in the overlying soils. The significant recharge areas are those with thicker soils. Field mapping indicates that thick soils in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge are characterized by a density of two or more geologic contacts per four square miles (source: 1976 1:500,000 Geologic Map of Georgia) and slopes lower than eight percent. 
                  c.  In the Coastal Plain, the significant recharge areas are the surface outcroppings of the large and extensively used drinking water aquifers (e.g., the Floridian, the Clayton, etc.) and soils having high permeability according to the 1976 1:750,000 Soils Association Map of Georgia. 
                  (c)  [ Criteria. ] The following criteria pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8 shall apply in significant recharge areas within the unincorporated area of Lee County: 
                  (1)  The Department of Natural Resources shall not issue any permits for new sanitary landfills not having synthetic liners and leachate collection systems. 
                  (2)  The Department of Natural Resources shall not issue any new permits for the land disposal of hazardous wastes. 
                  (3)  The Department of Natural Resources shall require all new facilities permitted or to be permitted to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste to perform such operations on an impermeable pad having a spill and leak collection system. 
                  (4)  New above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all applicable Federal requirements. 
                  (5)  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within: 
                  a.  A high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.  A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet; 
                  c.  A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet. 
                  As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10-7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. (The average size of existing agricultural waste impoundments in Georgia is about 15 acre-feet; sheepsfoot rollers or pans with heavy rubber tires, which are normal equipment for most Georgia earth moving contractors, should be able to compact clay to the recommended vertical hydraulic conductivity.) 
                  (6)  New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereinafter "DHR Table MT-1"): 
                  a.  150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.  125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; and 
                  c.  110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  (7)  New mobile home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on Table MT-2 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereinafter "DHR Table MT-2") 
                  a.  150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.  125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; and 
                  c.  110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  (8)  There is hereby exempted from the requirements of (6) or (7) any approved lot of record which was approved by the appropriate county official prior to January 1, 2000. 
                  (9)  No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the DHR Manual and (6) and (7) above. 
                  (10)  New facilities which handle hazardous materials, of types and in amounts determined by department of natural resources, shall perform their operations on Impermeable surfaces having spill and leak collection systems, as prescribed by Department of Natural Resources. 
                  (11)  Conservative design shall be required in connection with the issuance of any new permits for the spray irrigation of wastewaters or the land spreading of wastewater sludges in areas having high pollution susceptibility. This shall be accomplished by comparing the Department of Natural Resources Criteria For Slow Rate Land Treatment (February, 1986 or latest edition) with amendments and other technical publications to site specific information submitted by a registered professional engineer for each project. 
                  (12)  Permanent storm water infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility. 
                  (13)  Exclusive of mining settling basins, new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner in areas having high pollution susceptibility. 
                  (d)  In the event that Lee County's ordinances for recharge area protection are not at least as stringent as the standards required by the Department of Natural Resources, then the standards of the Department of Natural Resources shall control.

                  (b)  The design of every development shall conserve, wherever possible, mature trees, wooded areas, water courses, scenic views, ponds, floodplain areas, historic landmarks and other significant and distinct features of the property. 
                  (Ord. of 9-18-2000(2), § 38-151) 
                  Sec. 38-152. - Classification of streets. 
                  (a)  There are three broad classification of streets within the county as listed below: 
                  (1)  Residential streets. 
                  a.  Residential streets represent the lowest traffic volume category. Their primary function is to serve abutting land use and provide access to residential uses. All residential streets are intended to accommodate relatively low traffic volumes at slow speeds in order to minimize the basic incompatibility of vehicles and the pedestrians and children that characterize residential neighborhoods. Depending upon the type and density of development served by these streets, they are more accurately subcategorized as follows. 
                  1.  A local street serves a maximum of 50 dwelling units or has average daily trips (ADT) of fewer than 500 vehicles. A local street may be culs-de-sac, loops or small cross streets. They do not function as a minor or major street, collector or arterial road. 
                  2.  A minor street collects traffic from local streets, as well as giving access to individual dwelling units. A minor street serves 51 to 115 dwelling units or has average daily trips fewer than 1,150 vehicles. 
                  3.  A major street provides access to minor and local streets and serves from 116 to 160 dwelling units or has average daily trips of 1,600 vehicles. 
                  b.  The following shall be applied to determine the number of dwelling units served by a street. This number shall then be used to determine the residential street subtype and therefor the standards that shall be applied. 
                  1.  A street segment is the length of a street between intersections or between points that define a change in street configuration. 
                  2.  The number of dwelling units served by a street segment includes all units having a frontage on that street segment and all units that have frontage on other segments of that street or other streets that contribute to the traffic volume of that segment. 
                  3.  When more than one route of access is available to a dwelling unit, that unit shall be counted as served by the street segments most likely to provide the access point for that unit as determined by the manager of development services. 
                  (2)  Collector streets intercept traffic from intersecting residential streets and deliver this traffic to arterial roads. A secondary function is service to abutting land use. Collector streets serve as barriers between neighborhoods and are designed for higher speeds and traffic volumes than residential streets. Collector streets are classified into two types as follows: 
                  a.  A minor collector may be residential, commercial, or industrial in character. Average daily traffic is between 1,600 and 3,200 vehicles and includes any street serving more than 160 dwelling units. 
                  b.  A major collector services major regional facilities and may carry non-local traffic. Average daily trips are between 3,200 and 7,000 vehicles and no parking on the street is permitted. 
                  (3)  Arterial streets are intended to provide for high-speed travel between or within communities or to and from collectors and expressways. Access is controlled so that only regionally significant land uses may take direct access to these roads. Average daily trips are usually over 7,000 vehicles.

                  Sec. 38-153. - Principles of systems layout.

                  Sec. 38-244. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities.

As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15)—(17) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;

                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsections (c)(16) and (17) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970. And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r) of the Rules for Erosion and Sedimentation Control, provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Lee County as established by intergovernmental agreement between Lee County and the cities of Leesburg and Smithville without first obtaining a permit from the county development services department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Director of Planning and Engineering of Lee County and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans together with two copies of stormwater calculations. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fee of $450.00 payable to Lee County, fees will also be assessed pursuant O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 38-244(c)(15)—(17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section or other violations within the Lee County Land Development Code (Chapter 38, section 28-241), or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, on any single site or cumulative sites in Lee County within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (7)  The planning and engineering department shall be authorized to issue a land development permit to approved applicants only after the following items for a complete application have been submitted: 
                  a.  The $80.00 per disturbed acre fee has been paid with $40.00 paid to the district and $40.00 to the local issuing authority (i.e., Lee County).

                  Editor's note— Res. No. LD05-A049, adopted Sept. 23, 2005, amended Art. VII, in its entirety to read as herein set out in §§ 38-281—38-315.3. Prior to inclusion of said resolution, Art. VII pertained to similar subject matter. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 38-281. - Findings of fact and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that: 
                  •  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  •  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  •  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  •  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Lee County Greenspace Plan provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  •  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution. 
                  Therefore, the Lee County Board of Commissioners has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  (b)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up; 
                  (8)  Develop policies, programs and projects that result in less impact to streams while creating sustainable communities; 
                  (9)  Identifying opportunities in impacted watersheds, and where practicable to retrofit or improve existing Best Management Practices (BMP's), install new BMP's where needed, disconnect impervious areas, and improve stream stability and habitat.

                  Sec. 38-288. - General criteria. 
                  (a)  A development's storm drainage facilities shall be designed so that there is no increase in the flooding of property upstream or downstream of the development without all the affected landowner's consent in the form of recorded drainage easements. 
                  (b)  A system emphasizing a natural as opposed to an engineered drainage strategy shall be encouraged. 
                  (c)  The storm drainage facilities shall have the hydraulic characteristics to accommodate the expected design flow of stormwaters, which consists of the: 
                  (1)  Off-site and on-site stormwater, including stormwater coming into a tract from upstream; 
                  (2)  Discharge of water into a natural drainageway; and

                  (g)  Special consideration shall be given to innovative drainage designs that would not adversely affect the quality of development in a particular area. 
                  (h)  No damming or ponding of water in gutters, public streets or other waterways shall be permitted except to a very limited extent where the manager of development services shall consider it necessary. 
                  (i)  Flow or storage of water across, over, or on public streets or parking lots intended for use by the public, except through approved, properly constructed drainage systems, shall not be allowed during the storm event. 
                  (j)  The 100-year flow pattern (overland and collection system) shall be defined, and any existing or future structures located in the overland flow path shall be elevated or constructed to above the defined flooding level.

                  (c)  New dwelling structures (along with all appurtenances to include all garages and mechanical equipment) located in lot recorded as part of a subdivision shall meet any of the following criteria for determining the dwelling structure finished floor elevation (F.F.E.): 
                  (1)  As part of the design process far subdivisions, the engineer or surveyor preparing the construction plans shall designate on the plans any lots which require no additional requirements as to grading and/or finished floor elevations. For all other lots, the plans shall clearly describe what special requirements are necessary to build on the lots with grading requirements (i.e., establish a minimum F.F.E., elevate the structure above the roadway elevation or other known feature a specified amount, or elevate the structure as required by the floodplain management ordinance in flood hazard zones A and AE). These requirements shall also be noted on the final plat recorded for the development. A permanent benchmark shall be established for the development and shown on the final plat. 
                  (2)  An engineer or surveyor lensed in the Sate of Georgia shall review available topographic information to determine whether the lot is located within or adjacent to a closed contour based upon local topography. If the lot is within or adjacent to the confines of a closed contour the engineer or surveyor shall certify that the building site for the dwelling is two feet above the spillover elevation (where present) or at least two feet above the 100-year high water level. The proposed structure shall have a finished floor elevation at least three feet above the calculated 100-year high water elevation. The 100-year high water elevation shall include pre and post-developed runoff coming to the site and shall include any stormwater retention or detention area whether manmade or natural. 
                  (3)  For lots recorded prior to the date of this requirement, the builder shall obtain the services of a professional engineer or registered land surveyor to visit the site and/or review original subdivision construction plans to determine if special grading and/or finished floor elevations are appropriate for the proposed structure. If the engineer/surveyor finds that no special requirements are necessary, he shall write a letter to Lee County stating that there are no special requirements for the subject lot. If the engineer/surveyor finds that special considerations are warranted, he shall write a fetter to Lee County clearly describing what special requirements are necessary to build on the subject parcel (i.e., establish a minimum F.F.E., elevate the structure above the roadway elevation or other known feature a specified amount, or elevate the structure as required by the floodplain management ordinance in flood hazard zones A and AE). 
                  (4)  As an alternative to hiring an engineer or surveyor to perform the services described in subsection (3) above, the builder may elevate the dwelling structure and appurtenances so that all finished floors elevated to at least 24 inches above the centerline of the road at the lowest point along the lot frontage. Earthen fill shall be placed around the foundation of all dwelling structures so that the elevation of the finished grade immediately adjacent to the foundation of the structure shall be at least 12 inches above the road centerline at the lowest point along the lot frontage. The grade shall be sloped away from the structure for a slope of not less than six inches within a distance of ten feet. 
                  (d)  Permit process. 
                  (1)  Prior to issuing a residential building permit, Lee County shall review the recorded subdivision plat to determine if there are special grading considerations for the subject lot. 
                  (2)  If the final plat or other criteria requires a minimum finished floor elevation for the subject lot, the builder shall obtain the services of a registered surveyor licensed in Georgia to set a grade stake on site at the required minimum finished floor elevation for use in constructing the structure foundation. 
                  (3)  Following completion of construction but prior to occupancy, the builder shall again obtain the services of a registered surveyor to confirm that the structure was properly elevated. The surveyor shall write a letter to the county noting the required minimum finished floor elevation and the actual constructed finished floor elevation.

                  Drainage collection and conveyance shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  All drainage computations must show the drainage area, runoff constraints, time of concentration and discharge for the required storm frequency. These computations must be in a report format and show high waters in feet above the inlet of the pipe or above the flow line of the grate. All structures must have computations for inlet control and outlet control. The methods for calculations shall be clearly stated and all assumptions clearly defined. 
                  (2)  These standards are to serve as a guide to engineers versed in drainage analysis and design. Unique circumstances requiring special or alternative design methods shall be brought to the attention of the county early in the project life so that agreement on problem approach can be reached without impacting the project progress. 
                  (3)  Peak flow and total runoff volume after development will not exceed the peak flow and total runoff volume prior to development for the following storm events two-year, five-year, ten-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year unless the downstream landowner has granted legal permission to increase flooding. 
                  a.  Design storm of collection systems: 
                  1.  Ten-year event for drainage sub-basins with ten-year peak flows less than 75 cubic feet per second (hereinafter "cfs").

Given these functions, the street drainage collection system shall locate inlets at low points and at other points required for proper drainage and inlets should be placed where they can efficiently intercept and capture water flow. The safety of the traveling public must also be addressed in the proposed design. 
                  (2)  All inlet grates shall be designed to avoid blockage by debris and to address bicycle and pedestrian safety. 
                  (3)  Locating curb inlets in the radius of intersections or driveways is not recommended and such shall be avoided if possible. 
                  (4)  Street drainage shall not flow through an intersection by means of crossing the roadway. Street drainage is allowed to follow the intersection radius though this is not recommended and shall be avoided if possible.

                  Sec. 38-303. - Stormwater management area design. 
                  (a)  Overall detention/retention area design shall typically conform to the following: 
                  (1)  Emergency spillways designed to pass the 100-year storm post-developed peak flow. Emergency spillways are to be placed in undisturbed soils wherever possible. 
                  (2)  Any retention basin shall have the ability to percolate a volume of one inch of runoff/acre of watershed within seven days. 
                  a.  All retention basins shall be designed to store the post developed runoff volume for the two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year storm events. 
                  b.  When the pre developed and post developed runoff volumes are collected and concentrated into a closed or channeled storm conveyance system and where that volume is directed to a retention facility then the capacity for that entire pre and post developed runoff storage volume shall be created within the retention facility. 
                  (c)  All proposed retention ponds, whether manmade or natural stormwater storage ponds, shall have the pre developed seasonal high water table elevation established based upon a detailed site soil investigation survey. 
                  (1)  A detailed site investigation survey shall be performed prior to plan design to determine what soils are present in the immediate confines of the proposed retention pond. The survey shall consist of either: two excavation pits located at opposite ends of the retention site or four three-inch diameter auger bores located at each corner of the retention site. The test pit and the bores shall extend vertically at least two feet below the bottom elevation of the proposed retention pond and shall be within the confines of the lowest proposed bottom contour. 
                  (d)  At the conclusion of the soil investigation: if the soils at the bottom of all of the test pits or bores have the ability to percolate a volume of stormwater equal to or greater than one inch of runoff per acre of watershed within a seven-day period then the retention pond shall be allowed with the required storage capacity constructed in a typical vertical configuration starting with excavation at the existing natural grade and going vertically downward to the proposed elevation for the retention pond bottom. If however any of the test pits or bores in the soils survey determines that the soils will not percolate at a volume equal to or greater than one inch of runoff per acre of watershed within a seven-day period then the storage required for retention shall be created by excavating horizontally over an area of sufficient size to store the required volume above the minimum or most restrictive elevation related to the depth of the seasonal high water table for the soil series contained in the top five feet of natural ground. 
                  (1)  To determine the soil series within the top five feet of the natural grade at least four samples (to be spaced at least 75 feet but not more than 100 feet apart) per acre shall be taken.

                  Sec. 38-321. - Intersection design. 
                  (a)  Design compliance. Intersection design shall be in compliance with the specifications in Table 5.6. These standards shall govern all residential/residential, residential/collector, and collector/collector intersections. 
                  (b)  Approach speed. A minimum approach design speed of 25 miles per hour is required for all intersections. The safe approach speed involves safe stopping distance on vertical and horizontal curves beginning about 100 feet from the intersection, plus clear sight distance. 
                  (c)  Clear sight distance. Minimum sight triangle distances as shown in table 5.6 are required at all intersections. 
                  (1)  Where any street intersection is created that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility within the clear sight triangle the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary by the manager of development services to comply with the sight distance requirements of this section and shall not erect any sign or improvement that would preclude safe sight distance. 
                  (d)  Minimum angle of intersection. It is required for all intersection approaches to meet as close as possible to a 90-degree angle. Skewed or angled intersections shall be avoided. 
                  (e)  Minimum centerline offset of adjacent intersection. 
                  (1)  Offsets of at least 125 feet between centerlines shall be required. In the case of two collector street intersections this offset shall be increased to at least 150 feet in order to allow for left turn storage between intersections. 
                  (2)  When offset intersections are used at an arterial they should be located to avoid conflicting left turns. Such left-turn conflicts exist when an intersection offsets to the right rather than to the left. 
                  (f)  Minimum tangent length approaching intersection. See table 5.6. The guidelines in this table would not apply to a collector with a 1,000 foot radius that is intersected by a residential street. It would apply to an intersecting residential street with a 200 foot radius leg. 
                  (g)  Table 5.6, Minimum intersection design standards.

                  (b)  Street name signs. Street name signs shall be of the type normally existing within the unincorporated parts of the county. Any atypical sign shall be approved by the board of commissioners and shall meet all requirements for visibility by the manual of uniform traffic control devices. Signage shall be purchased from the county at the county's cost. The county will install all signs except atypical signs. Any atypical signs approved by the board of commissioners shall be installed and maintained at the sole cost and expense of the subdivision developer or the subdivision homeowners' association. 
                  (c)  Traffic Signs. 
                  (1)  Each sign shall conform to the standards set forth in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Each sign shall be displayed only for the specific purpose described in the manual. 
                  (2)  Signs shall be located to optimize night visibility and in conformance with safety factors related to fixed obstacles near the roadway. Signs shall not be located where they may obscure other signs or where they may be hidden from view by roadside objects. Signs requiring different decisions by vehicle operators shall be spaced sufficiently far apart for the required decisions to be made safely. 
                  (3)  Stop signs shall not be erected at intersections controlled by traffic control signals and shall be removed if a traffic control signal is installed at the same location. 
                  (4)  Signs shall have the maximum practical lateral clearance from the edge of the traveled way for the safety of vehicles that might leave the road and strike the sign posts. Sign posts and their foundations and sign mountings shall be constructed to hold signs in a proper and permanent position to resist swaying in the wind and to resist displacement by vandalism. Special care shall be taken to see that weeds, shrubbery and construction materials are not allowed to obscure the face of any sign. 
                  (5)  Traffic control signs shall be of the type normally existing within the unincorporated areas of the county. Signage shall be purchased from the county at the county's cost and included in the overall subdivision fee. The county will do all installation. 
                  (d)  Traffic signals. 
                  (1)  When it has been determined that a street or development requires the installation of a traffic signal the developer (or government for governmental projects) shall be responsible for all costs associated with the installation of the signal equipment. 
                  (2)  The use of more than one signal head on each approach shall be mandatory. 
                  (e)  Temporary safety requirements. 
                  (1)  All temporary traffic control devices shall be governed by the following principles as described in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
                  a.  Traffic safety in work areas shall be an integral part and high priority element of every project from planning through design and construction. Maintenance work shall be planned and conducted with the safety of vehicle operators, pedestrians and workers kept in mind at all times. 
                  b.  Traffic movement shall be inhibited as little as practical. 
                  c.  Traffic movement shall be guided in a clear and positive manner while approaching and traversing work areas. 
                  d.  To ensure acceptable levels of operation, routine inspection of traffic control elements shall be performed. 
                  (2)  The closing of portions of any street shall be coordinated with the planning and development department, public works department and public safety departments so as to interfere with traffic as little as possible. Suitable barricades and signs to direct traffic shall be provided and appropriately placed and maintained as long as necessary. Such barricades and signs shall be promptly removed when no longer needed. The county public safety departments shall be notified in advance of the closing and reopening of any street. 
                  (3)  Specific criteria described in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for the temporary closing of street shall be strictly adhered to. 
                  (f)  Street lighting. 
                  (1)  Streetlights shall be installed in all new major subdivisions or phases of major subdivisions in R-1, R-2, and R-3 zoning districts at the developers expense and subject to the specifications of this chapter. Major subdivisions are defined in section 58-8 of this Code. 
                  (2)  The developer shall contract with the electric service provider that provides coverage where the subdivision is located to purchase, install and perpetually maintain the lighting system. A copy of the executed contract between the developer and the service provider shall be included with the application for final subdivision approval. 
                  (3)  Specifications. 
                  a.  A lighting system plan meeting the specifications of this Code shall be submitted along with all other plan sheets and required documents for approval of a land development permit. 
                  b.  A light fixture shall be installed as follows: 
                  1.  A lighting fixture shall be installed on the lot line, at every second lot on alternating sides of the road with intersections to be considered as a lot for design purposes. 
                  2.  Right-of-way widths vary depending on whether roads are constructed using curb and gutter or open ditches for conveying stormwater. Therefore the following shall apply: 
                  i.  On curb and gutter roads the light poles shall be set on the utility easement, one foot outside the right-of-way line. 
                  ii.  On open ditch roads the grades of the front and back slopes of the stormwater conveyance ditches can vary from one project to another depending on the slope of the back ditch. The light poles shall be set so that the poles will not be located in the front slope, back slope or bottom of the ditch. In no case shall the light pole be installed in the functional stormwater conveyance portion of the ditch. All light poles shall be set at the top of the back slope, in the utility easement at least one foot outside the right-of-way line. If the point one foot outside the right-of-way line is still within the confines of the ditch then the pole location shall be moved further up the back slope until out of the active conveyance area of the ditch. 
                  c.  All power cables providing electricity to street lights shall be buried within the utility easement and run parallel to the right-of-way. Any power lines passing under a county road supplying power to the opposite side of the road shall be installed in conduit and shall run parallel to the right-of-way line. No power cable or electrical conduit shall traverse a county roadway on a skewed angle to the right-of-way. 
                  d.  For specifications for lighting fixtures, poles and required accessories see the following table: 

                   

                   
                  (4)  The lighting system for the entire subdivision shall be activated when the county building inspection department certifies the first dwelling within the development for occupancy. The county utility billing department shall begin billing individual lot owners the amount of $4.50 per month for the electric usage and maintenance cost of the street lights in the subdivision with the first regular billing cycle commencing after the electric power is activated for the lighting system in the subdivision. 
                  (g)  Road striping requirements 
                  (1)  All new major subdivisions and new phases of existing major subdivisions shall have pavement striping installed at the time the project is built for all roads classified as minor collector and higher classifications as defined under section 38-152. The developer shall pay all associated costs. 
                  a.  When meeting the criteria of minor collector or above, all internal subdivision roads in new phases of existing major subdivisions and in all new major subdivisions shall be striped with a yellow, broken centerline. 
                  b.  All lines shall be four inches in width. All striping shall be in accordance with the most current edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) as well as the most current edition of the Georgia Department of Transportation Standard Specifications (Section 652). 
                  c.  The design engineer shall evaluate the proposed road design. Upon completion of the evaluation and in conformance with the guidelines contained in Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), the design engineer shall incorporate in the plan any requirements for road striping as he/she deems necessary regarding the safety of the public. This shall include any roadway design; even those roads classified as less than a minor collector.

This condition applies only when the building is located less than 40 feet from the county right-of-way and the driveway is to be located in front of the building. 
                  (i)  Sight distance along roadway. 
                  (1)  All driveways shall be so located, designed and constructed so that vehicle operators using them will have adequate sight distance in both directions along the road. 
                  (2)  All exit driveways or driveway lanes shall have the following minimum sight distance measured in each direction. The following are minimums, the manager of development services may require longer distances based on the site specific road conditions to assure safety. 

                   
                  (3)  A permit shall not be issued for an entrance when the specified sight distance is not available along the entire road to the fronting shoulder opposite each driveway. In instances where an application's frontage is limited and a driveway cannot be constructed due to an inadequate sight distance, a plan may be required that incorporates a service or approach road off the right-of-way to a point where a satisfactory and safe intersection with the roadway is possible. The applicant shall bear the cost of construction and maintenance of such service or approach road. 
                  (j)  Mailboxes. 
                  (1)  No new, replacement or relocated mailbox shall be allowed to exist on the county's right-of-way or easements if it interferes with the safety of the travelling public or the uniform standards of function and beautification on the county roadway system. 
                  (2)  The mailbox shall be located in accordance with the rules and regulations of the postmaster general and this chapter.

                  Sec. 38-337. - Driveway design. 
                  (a)  General conditions. Where turnouts and driveways access state or federal roads and permits are required by the Georgia Department of Transportation, a copy of such permit shall be supplied to the county by the applicant. 
                  (b)  Acceleration/deceleration lane requirements. 
                  (1)  The appropriate deceleration lane (commercial or industrial uses) shall be constructed. Acceleration lanes shall also be required where it is determined by the manager of development services that they are needed because of the nature of the business or type traffic in question. The county shall have no obligation to pay the cost for construction of such lanes. The right-of-way for such lanes and for future provision of acceleration lanes shall be dedicated to the county by the applicant, subject to the county's acceptance thereof. 
                  (2)  The pavement section for the lanes shall match that of the main road or be a lesser design if approved by the manager of development services. In areas where there will remain an open road side ditch, curb and gutter will not generally be required along the longitudinal part of the decel/accel lanes, but shall be provided on the radii, medians, etc., in order to prevent potholes in the radius of the drive. 
                  (3)  Right turn lanes must be constructed if the daily site generated right turn volumes (RTV) based on the ITE trip generation (assuming a reasonable distribution of entry volumes) meet or exceed the values the Georgia Department of Transportation has established for minimum requirements for a right turn lane. See chart below. 

                   
                  (c)  Angle. 
                  (1)  The angle of one-way driveways with the roadway shall be as close to 90 degrees as possible. 
                  (2)  Driveways used for two-way operation shall intersect the roadway at an angle as near 90 degrees as possible. 
                  (3)  If joined with another two-way driveway conditions shall be that no vehicle will have to make a deflection of greater than 90 degrees when entering or leaving the property. 
                  (d)  Driveway radii. 
                  (1)  Rural radii shall not approach the boundary lines except as provided in this chapter and shall not encroach upon the arc of a curve connecting the curb or edge or pavement at an intersection. In all cases a minimum eight-foot tangent section shall be required between all driveway radii and all roadway intersection radii. The range of radii vary from ten to 30 feet for a driveway. The radius for long wheel base vehicles shall not exceed 30 feet. When planning for passenger vehicles the radius shall be six feet. For small truck traffic the radii lengths shall be 15 feet. When the angle of the intersection of the inside edge of the driveway and the line paralleling the highway pavement is 45 degrees; a five-foot radius shall be used. This shall be increased to 7½ feet when the angle is 60 degrees and ten or 15 feet or larger if the intersection angle is 90 degrees. 
                  (2)  Urban radii shall not approach the boundary lines referred to in this chapter or encroach upon the arc of the curve of the edge of the pavement or curb connecting intersecting streets or roads. The driveway radii shall not be greater than 35 feet except where there is little pedestrian traffic in which case the radii may be increased if required to prove a satisfactory entrance appropriate for the type of vehicles which the driveway is designed. The acute angle radius shall not exceed five feet. When curb and gutter are removed for the purpose of constructing a driveway, the driveway shall be constructed of equivalent material. The entrance curb shall be of the same design and material as the existing curb and gutter to which it is joined. 
                  (e)  Driveway radii adjacent to roadway intersections. In urban or rural areas, as determined by the manager of development services, driveways to be near street intersections shall be located so as to provide for a minimum 30-foot radius on the curb line of the street. In rural areas as determined by the manager of development services, driveways to be near street intersections along open ditch roads shall have a 35-foot minimum radius as the minimum condition. 
                  (f)  Grade. 
                  (1)  Residential driveways (single-family, duplex, triplex, quadraplex only): the driveway grade shall not exceed eight percent maximum change within the right-of-way area. Of great importance is the change in grade, which shall not exceed 12 percent within the ten feet of distance. Car bottoming on the crest can be avoided by use of eight percent maximum change per ten feet as required. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential driveways: 
                  a.  Rural as determined by the manager of development services. The grade of the driveway shall slope downward and away from the road surface at the rate not less than 2.08 percent or more than 6.25 percent out to the road ditch line, but in no case less than 18 feet from the edge of the pavement. Where the roadway pavement is super-elevated and the upper shoulder is graded to the slope of the pavement, the grade of the driveway shall conform to the slope of the shoulder to a point 12 feet from the edge of the pavement. However, beyond this 12-foot line the driveway and islands shall be designed to rollover grade so that water from this area will not flow onto the roadway shoulder or pavement. In some cases it may not be feasible to continue the slope of the pavement upward with the super elevation. In such cases the manager of development services shall make this determination during his inspection and review of the permit request and will revise the plans submitted accordingly, as well as provide adequate documentation as to why this variance was made in this particular instance. Through the remaining right-of-way width the grade of the driveways shall not be greater than 6.25 percent, positive or negative. In areas where the right-of-way exists the elevation of the driveway at the right-of-way line shall not be more than one foot higher or lower than the edge of the road at the point opposite that point on the driveway unless specifically waived by the manager of development services and documented on the plan as to why the waiver was justified. 
                  b.  Urban as determined by the manager of development services: T grade of the driveways shall usually conform to the grades to the back of the gutter. When curb or curb and gutter exists, the grade of the driveway shall not exceed the grades set forth in the preceding paragraph in this article. Where curb and gutter does not exist the grade shall conform to the rural requirements. 
                  (g)  Joint driveways. 
                  (1)  The maximum width of a joint driveway shall be 40 feet. A joint driveway shall be at 90 degrees with the highway. Its location may result in unequal areas of the driveway on each frontage. The side of the joint driveway shall be parallel one with the other as required for individual driveways. 
                  (h)  Driveway sides. 
                  (1)  The two sides of any driveway shall be parallel. 
                  (i)  Lane use and paving. 
                  (1)  A drive shall not be designed or marked to allow more than one lane of traffic to enter the roadway at a time unless such a drive is separated and channelized in accordance with state department of transportation requirements. 
                  (2)  Pavement is required for all acceleration and deceleration lanes. All driveways shall be paved within the right-of-way if the roadway is also paved. If roadway is not paved, then no paving is allowed within the right-of-way. 
                  (3)  Pavement materials and construction shall conform to the standards of this chapter. 
                  (j)  Driveway widths. 
                  (1)  Driveways serving large volumes of daily traffic or traffic over 15 percent truck traffic shall be required to utilize high to maximum dimensions. 
                  (2)  No width shall exceed the maximum or be less than the minimum listed below, measure parallel with the roadway or if the roadway is on a curve, parallel with the tangent of the curve at the point where the centerline of the driveway intersects or edge of pavement where no curb exists. 

                   
                  (3)  Any types of developments not listed above shall meet the commercial and industrial requirements.

                  Sec. 38-338. - Island locations, dimensions, development and delineation. 
                  (a)  Any two driveway's connection with a highway shall be separated by an island area. The side of the island adjacent to the highway travel lane shall be located at the existing curb line if any. Otherwise the side of the island shall be ten or more feet from the edge of the pavement as specified by the county. If approved by the manager of development services the distance between the side of the island and the edge of the pavement may be less than ten feet. 
                  (b)  Adjacent to acceleration and deceleration lane. 
                  (1)  Where an acceleration or deceleration lane exists, the side of the island adjacent to the road travel lane or shoulder thereof shall be located at the island roadside ditch, or if curb type barrier is used, at the outer edge of the acceleration or deceleration lane, but not less than ten feet from the edge of the normal pavement unless so specified by the manager of development services. 
                  (c)  Adjacent to turning lane. 
                  (1)  When a curb turning lane lies within the frontage of the property the island shall extend to the existing curb of the turning lane. Where no turning lane exists the side of the uncurbed island shall be at the roadside ditch. If the island is required to be curbed the curb shall be installed 24 inches from the edge of the turning lane pavement (where this pavement is greater than ten feet from the edge of the pavement of the normal section) utilizing paved concrete gutter between the edge of the pavement and the curb. 
                  (d)  Pavement markings. 
                  (1)  Curbing shall be painted either reflectorized white or yellow in accordance with the MUTCD. 
                  (e)  Minimum length. 
                  (1)  Islands shall extend to the right-of-way and shall be a minimum length of 20 feet including radii at that point. The length of the island at the shoulder will be determined by the angle of the driveway and ROW depth but shall not be less than 20 feet. Although an island 20 feet in length is authorized in many instances where the open ditch plan, the island or distance between the driveway pavements must be greater than 20 feet in order to fulfill maximum permissible slope requirements and prevent the need for headwalls and conform to this article. Length is to be that distance measured parallel to the roadway. Depth will be that distance between the right-of-way line and the pavement edge. 
                  (f)  Unpaved islands. 
                  (1)  The area or island between the uncurbed driveways serving roadside enterprises shall remain unpaved unless a sidewalk is required of sufficient width to cover the entire island. 
                  (g)  Open ditch islands. 
                  (1)  Where a roadside ditch exists, providing an acceptable obstacle to prevent vehicular traffic over the island, the applicant may request to retain the condition. If approved by the county, delineation of the driveway and roadway will not be required. However, an acceptable barrier consisting of six or eight vertical concrete curb, six inches or more in height which shall circumscribe those islands installed between and on either side of the driveways.

                  Sec. 38-339. - Encroachment upon intersection design. 
                  (a)  Right-of-way line projection. 
                  (1)  No portion of a driveway shall be within the area lying between the normal right-of-way lines continued or projected on existing courses to the curb line or edge of the pavement at intersections. Provided that, with good cause shown, the county may waive this provision when a deep right-of-way or a acute angle or intersection of the roadway makes such action appropriate. 
                  (b)  Right-of-way miter. 
                  (1)  Right-of-way acquired for or used for improvement of visibility or for traffic channelization (right-of-way miter). At intersections where additional right-of-way has been secured for the roadway back of the prolongation of the normal rights-of-way lines in order to provide for channelization of traffic or more adequate sight distances, no part of any entrance or exit shall be permitted to encroach upon such additional right-of-way. The area described shall be considered as restricted areas and may be filled. 
                  (c)  Encroachment upon intersection features. 
                  (1)  The legs, connections, ramps and other roadway features of a roadway intersection or interchange are a part of the intersection and the safety of the public and the planned movement of traffic require that no driveway shall be connected with such features for the purpose of serving roadside areas. 
                  (2)  A driveway serving a roadside areas shall not be connected to a service or frontage road of a limited access road in the area where said service road serves the dual purpose of a leg, connector or ramp of an intersection or interchange. 
                  (3)  No driveway shall be connected to a frontage or service road in the area where the service road is widened or curved for connection with an interchange or intersection connection, ramp or leg. 
                  (4)  No portion of a driveway other than a normal radius shall enter the right-of-way at a point at distances of less than 25 feet from the point of intersection of the right-of-way lines or no driveway entrance or exit shall be located within 50 feet of the point of tangency of the existing or proposed curb radius. This provision may be reduced in areas where limited access rights-of-way exist and the frontage is limited in such a manner as to deny all access to the property.

                  (a)  No driveways parallel to the roadway shall be constructed on the right-of-way in front of gasoline pumps, loading or unloading platforms or other structures requiring and outside or frontage driveway. 
                  (b)  Pump islands or other structures requiring an outside driveway shall be located at a minimum distance of 20 feet from the right-of-way line in order that the outside driveway and services areas shall not encroach on the right-of-way line. In instances where pump islands are to be located opposite any part of the driveway, the end of the pump island nearest the right-of-way shall be a minimum of 40 feet behind the right-of-way line. 
                  (c)  Pump islands which must be less than 20 feet behind the right-of-way shall in all cases require the erection of an acceptable barrier along the right-of-way line for at least the length of the pump island. This distance from the right-of-way line to the pump islands shall be increased if space is available if the development plans to accommodate tractor trailers, recreational vehicles, buses or other long wheel base vehicles. 
                  (d)  An island with right-of-way barrier is required opposite all structures which will function as a traffic obstacle (such as bumper curbs, sidewalks, front of buildings…etc.) located or to be located less than 40 feet from the right-of-way lines. Such a barrier may not be necessary in cases where structures will not have an outside driveway or service area between the right-of-way and the front of the structure.

                  (b)  Codes and standards. Conform to all federal, state and local laws and regulations. 
                  (c)  Qualifications of testing agency. Where the services of a testing agency are required, use only qualified testing laboratories with no less than three years experience in conducting and evaluation the required tests [sic]. 
                  (d)  Submittals. Submit laboratory reports to the manager of development services for all tests performed on this project as required by these specifications or by applicable federal, state or local agencies. 
                  (e)  Phasing of water line testing. 
                  (1)  Sections of water lines connected to existing water lines that are in service (even though valved off) shall be chlorinated, flushed and checked for absence of bacteria before the new section of line can be tested for hydrostatic compliance. This is set forth to prevent contaminated water or water with high chlorine content from being forced into a line in service through a faulty valve or other defect during pressure tests. 
                  (2)  Sections of water lines not physically connected to existing water lines, at the contractor's option, may test the line for hydrostatic pressure compliance before chlorinating. 
                  (3)  After water lines have passed the waterline purification test, the lines are tested for hydrostatic pressure compliance. Each valved section of water line is to be tested separately. 
                  (4)  The manager of development services shall be notified 48 hours prior to testing and allowed opportunity to witness hydrostatic testing and waterline purification. 
                  (f)  Water line purification. 
                  (1)  Before being placed into service. All new water distribution systems or extensions to existing systems, or any valved section of such extension or any replacement in the existing water distribution system shall be chlorinated. Any of the following methods of procedure shall be followed: 
                  a.  Liquid chlorine gas-water mixture; 
                  b.  Direct chlorine feed; and 
                  c.  Calcium hypochlorite and water mixture. 
                  (2)  Preliminary flushing. Prior to chlorinating, all dirt and foreign matter shall be removed by a thorough flushing through the hydrants, or by other approved means. Each valved section of newly laid pipe shall be flushed independently. On dead-end lines, temporary flushing outlets shall be provided and dead-end thoroughly flushed. Temporary outlets shall be removed and the end of the line plugged after flushing is complete. This shall be done after the pressure test is completed. 
                  (3)  Liquid chlorine. A chlorine gas-water mixture shall be applied by means of a solution fed chlorinating device, or if approved by the manager of development services, the gas shall be fed directly from a chlorine cylinder equipped with proper devices for regulating the rate of flow and the effective gas diffusion of gas within the pipe. Chlorinating with the gas-water mixture is preferred to the direct feed. 
                  (4)  Point of application. The preferable point of application of the chlorinating agent shall be at the beginning of the pipeline extension, or any valved section of it, and through a corporation stop inserted in the horizontal axis of the newly laid pipe. The water injector for delivering the gas-water mixture into the pipe shall be supplied from a tap on the pressure side of the gate valve controlling the flow into the pipeline extension. In a new system, application may be at the pumping station, or the elevated tank, or the standpipe or the reservoir if available. 
                  (5)  Rate of application. Water from the existing distribution system or other source of supply shall be controlled to flow very slowly into the newly laid pipeline during the application of chlorine. The rate of chlorine gas-water mixture flow shall be in such proportions to the rate of water entering the pipe that the chlorine dose applied to the water entering the newly laid pipe shall be at least 40 to 50 ppm. 
                  (6)  Back pressure prevented. Back pressure, causing a reversal of flow in the pipe being treated shall be prevented. 
                  (7)  Retention period. Treated water shall be retained in the pipe long enough to destroy all non-spore forming bacteria. The period shall be at least 24 hours and preferably longer as may be directed by the manager of development services. After the chlorine treated water has been retained for the required time, the chlorine residual at pipe extremities and at other representative points shall be at least 24 ppm. Water samples must be taken from suitable taps. 
                  (8)  Chlorinating valves and hydrants. In the process of chlorinating newly laid water pipe, all valves or other appurtenances shall be operated while the pipe is filled with the chlorinating agent. 
                  (9)  Final flushing and test. On dead-end lines, temporary flushing outlets shall be provided and the dead-end thoroughly flushed. Temporary outlets shall be removed and end of line plugged after flushing is complete. 
                  (10)  Repetition of procedure. Should the initial treatment prove ineffective, the chlorinating procedure shall be repeated until confirmed tests show that water sampled from the newly laid pipe conforms to the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (11)  Calcium hypochlorite or chlorinated lime in water. On approval of the manager of development services, a mixture of either calcium hypochlorite or chlorinated lime of known chlorine content my be substituted as an alternative for liquid chlorine. 
                  (12)  Proportions of calcium hypochlorite or chlorinated lime and water mixture. A five percent solution shall be prepared consisting of five percent of either powder to 95 percent water by weight. 
                  (13)  Application. This calcium hypochlorite or chlorinated lime and water mixture, first made into a paste and them thinned to a slurry, shall be injected or pumped into newly laid pipe under conditions heretofore specified for liquid chlorine applications after preliminary flushing. 
                  (14)  Approval. Provisions for final flushing, testing and approval under this alternative shall be the same as those described previously. 
                  (15)  Procedure when cutting into existing pipelines. Cuts made in existing pipelines for the insertion of valves, fittings, repairs, or for any other purpose shall be chlorinated by shaking a predetermined quantity of the powder into the pipe on each side of the cut-in. After slowly filling the section and reversing the flow, the chlorinated water shall be retained for at least four hours, then flushed until no order of chlorine can be detected in the flushing water, or until a check has been made for residual chlorine as provided for herein. If the contractor has any knowledge of foreign material entering the water line, or if the unfinished connection has been left unattended, or if the manager of development services requests, service shall not be restored until the absence of bacteria in the water has been demonstrated. 
                  (16)  Resumption of service. After satisfactory chlorinating by any of these alternative procedures, the consumer may be served from the newly laid pipeline or the service may be resumed on existing pipelines only after approval of the public health authority having jurisdiction and the county. 
                  (g)  Water quality tests of water mains. 
                  (1)  Following chlorinating, all treated water shall be thoroughly flushed from the newly laid pipe line at its extremities until the replacement water is throughout its length. 
                  (2)  After thoroughly flushing the new pipe, the water is required to be, upon testing, both chemically and bacteriologically proven equal to the water quality served the public and approved by the public health authority having jurisdiction and the manager of development services. 
                  (3)  Should the initial treatment as specified above prove ineffective, the water line purification procedure shall be repeated until confirmed tests show that water sampled from the newly laid pipe conforms to the requirements. 
                  (4)  Resumption of service. After satisfactory waterline purification by any of the procedures above, the consumer may be served from the newly laid pipeline or the service may be resumed on existing pipelines only after the approval of the public health authority having jurisdiction and the manager of development services. 
                  (h)  Hydrostatic tests of water mains. 
                  (1)  Pressure of test. Hydrostatic pressure to be used shall be 150 psi. (AWWA C500 Sec. 4.1 and 4.2) 
                  (2)  Duration of pressure test. Test shall last at least two hours. 
                  (3)  Procedure.

The pump, pipe connection, gauges and all necessary apparatus shall be furnished by the contractor. 
                  (4)  Expelling air. Before applying the specified test pressure all air shall be expelled from the pipe. To accomplish this, taps will be made, if necessary, at points of highest elevation and afterwards tightly plugged. Tapping clamps and saddles shall be used on PVC pipes. 
                  (5)  Permissible leakage. Suitable means will be provided by the contractor for determining the quantity of water lost by leakage under normal operating pressure. No pipe installation will be accepted if the leakage (evaluated on a pressure basis of 150 psi) is greater than that determined by the following formula: 
                  L = SD(P).5/133,200 

                   
                  (6)  Variation from permissible leakage. Should any sections of pipe show leakage greater than the specified limit, the contractor shall locate and repair the defective part of the section until the leakage is within the specified allowance. When existing valves are used to isolate a section of line being tested, the contractor shall provide temporary caps or plugs to isolate the line being tested if the existing valve will not hold the required test pressure without leaking. 
                  (7)  Leakage defined. Leakage is the quantity of water to be supplied into the newly laid pipe, or any valved section [on] it, necessary to maintain the specified leakage test pressure after the pipe has been filled with water and the air expelled. 
                  (8)  Time for making test. Pipe may be subjected to hydrostatic pressure, inspected and tested for leaking at any convenient time after partial completion of backfill.

                  Sec. 58-159. - Effect of approval of general development plan. 
                  (a)  An approved general development plan is designed to serve as a guide for the applicant's preparation of the subdivision and the board of commissioners, planning commission and the planning department's review of future preliminary and final plats. Approval of a general development plan grants the developer the authority for five years, subject to engineering and environmental considerations, to submit the planned development phases for subdivision approval provided that the phases submitted are consistent with the approved general development plan. 
                  (b)  Each phase of the development shall be separately granted preliminary and final approval pursuant to major subdivision review procedures. Each section of a phased development must be planned and constructed in such a way that adheres to the approved general development plan concept and which meets all applicable design standards. Each phase of the development must be able to exist independently and effectively if no further phases are completed. 
                  (c)  The planning director may approve preliminary plats of phases with slight deviations from the approved general development plan but may require the submission of a revised general development plan if the changes are determined to significantly affect the character or performance of the development. 
                  (d)  The planning commission may grant the rights referred to in subsection (a), (b) and (c) of this section for such period of time longer than five years that it determines to be reasonable in light of either the anticipated period of time required to complete construction under the approved general development plan or such other circumstances peculiar to the particular development plan that the planning commission may find applicable.

                  (4)  The applicant, in the judgment of the manager of development services, has been unable to connect the subdivision's water system to the Lee County Utilities Authority's main water system solely because the authority's water system line to which such connection must be made has not been completed.

Any such applicant must execute an affidavit that he is aware that an occupation permit is not guaranteed and will, in fact, be denied as will the connection of permanent utilities until such time as the subdivision is completed as required under this article and the board of commissioners has accepted all rights-of-way and easements by resolutions. 
                  (c)  All persons working on buildings in subdivisions developed under this article shall use the temporary construction easements and stay off any subdivision road rights-of-way, drainage systems, or other site improvements under construction.

Adequate records shall be kept in the county, for examination by the revenue collection agent at that officer's discretion. If, after examination of the books and records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of under-reporting, a penalty of $150.00 shall be assessed for the period delinquent.

                  Failure of any person to pay an applicable administrative fee, regulatory fee, or occupation tax, or any part thereof, before it becomes delinquent, or upon the failure to permit inspection of books as required, shall result in any business tax certificates or regulatory fee certificates granted by the county under this article permitting such person to do business in the unincorporated areas of the county for the current year being automatically revoked without any further action required of the county. No new occupation tax certificate or regulatory fee certificate shall be granted by the county for the operation of a business for which any part of the occupation tax or fees herein required are unpaid, nor shall such certificates be issued to a person who has failed to submit adequate records for inspection as required by section 204 hereof.

In the case of those practitioners where the local government cannot suspend the right of the practitioner to conduct business, the imposition of civil penalties shall be permitted and pursued by the local government as in the case of delinquent occupation tax. These penalties shall consist of either ten percent of the amount due or a fine of $50.00, whichever is less, as determined by the revenue collection agency.

If at any time after the entry of the nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution pays the tax in full, together with all interest penalties and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges for services and goods due the person as though the person had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

                  (b)  Penalty and interest for failure to pay tax by due date.

In case of a false or fraudulent return of a failure to file a return where wilful intent exists to defraud the county of any tax due under this chapter, a penalty of 50 percent of the tax due shall be assessed.

                  (a)  Estimate of gross receipts. If any person fails to make a return and pay the tax as provided in this chapter, or makes a grossly incorrect return, or makes a return that is false or fraudulent, the tax collector shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the person or, as the case may be, of the amount of total rentals in the county which are subject to the tax.

                  (b)  Penalty and interest for failing to pay tax. The penalty and interest for failure to pay tax based upon a recomputation as authorized pursuant to this Code section shall be the same as that provided in section 62-305 hereof.

At any time within three years after any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected becomes due and payable and at any time within three years after the delinquency of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected, the tax collector may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction in the name of the county to collect the amount delinquent, together with penalty, interest, court fees, filing fees, attorney's fees, and other legal fees incident thereto. 
                  (b)  Delinquent taxes to be liens. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in addition to any and all other remedies that the county may have with respect to the collection of delinquent taxes under this chapter, such taxes shall be a lien upon the real and personal property of the person obligated to pay such tax, which lien shall be enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as are other liens for taxes owed to the county. 
                  (c)  Duty of successors or assignees of operator to withhold tax from purchase money. If any operator liable for any amount under this article sells out his business or quits the business, he shall make a final return and payment of taxes owed under this chapter within 15 days after the date of selling or quitting the business. Such seller's successors or assigns, if any, shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase money to cover the amount of the taxes, interest, and penalties due under this chapter and unpaid until the seller produces either a receipt from the county showing that the taxes, interest, and penalties due under this chapter have been paid, or a certificate from the county stating that no tax, interest, or penalty is due hereunder. If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold the purchase as required by this section, he shall be personally liable for the payment of any taxes, interest, and penalties accruing under this chapter and unpaid by the former owner. The personal liability of the purchaser in such a case shall not exceed the amount of the total purchase money, but the property being transferred shall in all cases continue to be subject to the full amount of the tax lien arising from the delinquency of the former owner. Paid executions may be transferred and enforced as otherwise provided by law. 
                  (d)  Credit for tax, penalty, or interest paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected. Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the county, it may be offset by the tax collector. If the operator or person determines that he has overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the tax collector, such person shall have three years from the date of payment to file a claim in writing stating the specific ground upon which the claim is founded. The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the tax collector, the excess amount paid the county may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person by whom it was paid.

                  (1)  Multiple-family residential and non-residential property abutting single-family residential property. Where non-residential property abuts property zoned for residential use, landscaping shall be provided along the side and rear property lines so that a solid screen five feet in height when planted is formed and will, within a year, grow to six feet. If deemed necessary by the planning director, or his designee, due to topographical changes between the multiple-family residential or non-residential and residential property, the minimum height may be increased to eight feet. At a minimum, materials shall consist of 25 percent evergreen trees a minimum of six feet tall, 25 percent ornamental and/or shade trees with a minimum three-inch caliper or in small groups of ornamental and/or shade trees six feet tall having the same effect of a three-inch caliper ornamental and/or shade tree, and 50 percent evergreen and deciduous shrubs, provided that no more than 25 of the shrubbery may be deciduous.

In order to encourage the preservation of existing trees, the area within the drip line of trees of 12 to 24 caliper inches that is protected by fencing during grading and construction and is included in the required landscape area shall receive double credit toward the required landscape area. If the tree is in the buffer area, such credit can be given in the buffer area as long as the desired buffer zone effect is accomplished. Otherwise, the credit shall be given to other areas, not located in the buffer area. 
                  Any tree 24 caliper inches or over shall be preserved, unless approved for removal by the planning director, or his designee where removal of such tree is mandated by development constraints that cannot reasonably be altered. If such tree is approved for removal, the tree must be replaced by a tree, or cluster of trees, that, when planted, has an overall caliper of at least six inches. 
                   Preservation of Trees

This includes irrigating or watering, fertilizing, pruning and replanting where necessary. Where fences or walls are involved, this also includes any and all necessary maintenance and/or repair. 
                  Necessary trimming and maintenance shall be the responsibility of the property owner or user of the property to maintain the health of all plant and landscaping materials, to provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance, and to assure that all screening actually serves the purpose for which it is intended. In cases of noncompliance, the planning director, or his designee, shall be empowered to take action as provided by law to ensure maintenance of all plant and landscaping materials. 
                  (k)  Miscellaneous requirements. 
                  (1)  All required landscape areas adjacent to vehicle use areas shall be protected by wheel stops, curbs, or other physical barriers.

                  (5)  Uses prohibited. The keeping, breeding or training of any animals or fowl for monetary gain or profit shall be deemed a commercial business and is expressly prohibited in all residential districts except where such operations may qualify as a non-conforming use as defined in this chapter. 
                  (Ord. of 12-2-2002, § 70-77) 
                  Sec. 70-88. - Reserved. 
                  Sec. 70-89. - Conditional uses. 
                  Before a building permit shall be issued for a conditional use, application shall be made to the planning commission which, after careful review of any applicable sections of this chapter, may recommend to the county commission the issuance of such permit or approval if in the judgment of the planning commission it will not be detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the county. 
                  An application to establish a conditional use shall be approved following a review by the planning commission and a determination by the board of commissioners that: 
                  (1)  The proposed use shall not be contrary to the purpose of this article. 
                  (2)  The proposed use shall not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood nor affect adversely the health and safety of residents and workers. 
                  (3)  The proposed use shall not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such facility, vehicular movement, noise or fume generation or type of physical activity. 
                  (4)  The proposed use shall not be affected adversely by the existing uses; and the proposed use will be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use. 
                  (5)  The parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted can be met. 
                  (6)  Provided, that the county commission may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; and provided that wherever the county commission shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations that any term, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, said commission shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing. 
                  (7)  Conditional uses shall not be transferable except upon written approval of the county commission and shall be executed within a period of 12 months from the time the use is granted or become null and void and subject to procedures for resubmission as established above and are subject to all other applicable laws and regulations.

                  Sec. 70-90. - Variances. 
                  (a)  The board of commissioners shall authorize, after review of the planning commission, in specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter as will not in its opinion, be contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this chapter will in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship. Such variance may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon consideration of the following criteria: 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography, and; 
                  (2)  The application of the chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship, and; 
                  (3)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved, and; 
                  (4)  Release if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public interest or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building which is prohibited by this article. The county will control the actual use of properties through zoning and conditional uses and not through variance. 
                  (b)  In exercising the above powers, the board of commissioners shall not consider any nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same district and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts as grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
                  (c)  If the board of commissioners grants a variance the reason for such variance must be put forth clearly in the minutes of the meeting at which the variance was granted. 
                  (d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, in the event that all criteria set out in subsections (a)(1) through (a)(4) above are met, the county manager, or his designee, shall be authorized to grant such variances without the necessity of approval by the board of commissioners in those circumstances where the requested variance would not exceed ten percent from existing building set-back requirements in the applicable zoning district.

                  (7)  The plan shall show all other structures on adjacent lots within ten feet of the appropriate property line. 
                  (8)  The plan shall show front, side, and rear elevations indicating the building height from finished grade. 
                  (b)  After the county planner or his duly authorized representative has approved the site plan such approval shall be noted on the permit application. 
                  (c)  Before construction begins, the builder shall locate and clearly mark all lot corners. 
                  (d)  At the time the building inspector conducts the foundation inspection, he may undertake whatever measurements he may deem appropriate including, but not limited to, measurements from the property lines to the proposed outermost edge of the building, so as to assure compliance with the approved site plan.

                  Editor's note— Res. No. Z05-031, adopted Sept. 23, 2005, repealed § 70-92, which pertained to recreation areas. See also the Code Comparative Table. 
                  Sec. 70-93. - Flag lots. 
                  Flag lots shall be subject to the following regulations: 
                  (1)  Flag lots shall be measured from the mid-point between two opposite lot lines of the flag portion of the lot. 
                  (2)  When calculating lot area the pole portion shall not be counted. 
                  (3)  The minimum required lot area shall be the same as that required in the zoning district in which it is located. 
                  (4)  The access pole must be part of the flag lot and must be under the same ownership as the flag portion. An easement shall not be allowed as a means of access to a flag lot. 
                  (5)  Flag lots shall not be permitted whenever their effect would be to increase the number of driveways taking access to a collector or arterial road. Shared driveways shall be used to eliminate additional points of access. This criterion prohibits one of the most common abuses, the use of flag lots to avoid the developmental costs of roads. These sites are best developed without flag lots, even if the cost of the lots is thereby increased, since controlling access reduces congestion on major roads. 
                  (6)  Any land division that creates one or more lots, flag or otherwise, with or without common access shall be a minor subdivision and shall meet all applicable regulations of the county subdivision ordinance. 
                  (7)  All applicable regulations of chapter 38 of the Code must be met. 
                  (8)  Flag lots have required building setbacks that must meet the requirements in the zoning district in which it is located. The pole portion shall not be considered when determining required building setbacks. 
                  (9)  The access pole shall have a minimum width of 30 feet and shall not be greater than or equal to the minimum required width for building in the applicable zoning district. The purpose of this maximum width criterion is to prevent an abuse of flag lots in order to circumvent the county's length versus width requirement in the subdivision of lots. The maximum length of the pole of the lot shall be no more than five times the lot width of the flag portion. 
                  (Ord. of 12-2-2002, § 70-93) 
                  Sec. 70-94. - Land conservation. 
                  (a)  In order to protect open green space and to reduce the cost of development of a residential subdivision, this chapter establishes density neutral development requirements by establishing the total number of units a specified amount of developable land will yield. This total yield must not include undevelopable areas such as storm water management ponds, and similar areas. In order to protect significant natural areas, wetlands and other similar areas may be used to meet the greenspace requirement. Wetland areas may also be used to meet stormwater management requirements in accordance with Chapter 38 of this Code. In order to do this, where the property is to be developed as a major subdivision, the following process must be followed: 
                  (1)  Delineate all unbuildable lands such as steep slopes, storm water retention areas, etc. 
                  (2)  Then, out of the remaining buildable land, determine the number of dwelling units desired, provided that the maximum density allowed by this chapter is not exceeded. 
                  (3)  Once subsection (2) is done, where the property is to be developed as a major subdivision with at least a county provided water system or a county provided sewer system, unless otherwise specified, a minimum of 25 percent of the remaining developable land shall be preserved. Where the property is to be developed with wells and septic tanks, a minimum of ten percent of the developable land shall be preserved. Preservation under this section shall be accomplished by delineating any potential conservation areas such as significant tree stands, fields, historic or cultural areas. These areas shall be preserved as a common area for the residents of the subdivision. Unless the conservation area is conveyed to and accepted by the county, a legal entity such as, a homeowner's association, or trust for maintenance and care must be established and evidence thereof provided to the county and filed with the subdivision files. Such legal entity must have perpetual existence and be responsible for the continued preservation of the preserved land. Whenever an adjacent development has already preserved greenspace, all greenspace areas must be connected among the different developments in order to provide a connected greenspace "belt." 
                  (4)  Once potential conservation areas noted in subsection (3) are delineated, the next step is to locate potential house sites on the remaining land. 
                  (5)  Once potential house sites are located, streets should be aligned with the houses. Trails, separate from public roads, may also be used to connect the house sites to allow neighborhood connectivity. 
                  (6)  The final step is to draw in lot lines. These cannot include unbuildable lands noted in subsection (1) or land delineated as conservation areas per subsection (3). 
                  Unless the entire property consists of buildable lands, both subsection (1) or subsection (3) requirements must be complied with by the developer; provided, however, that in no event shall less than 25 percent of the total tract be preserved in developments where wells and septic tanks are not to be used, and no less than ten percent of the total tract shall be preserved in developments where wells and septic tanks are to be used. 
                  (b)  The requirements of subparagraph (a) of this section shall not be applicable in R-1L, R-3L or when the governing body has required a minimum building lot size greater than allowed for the zoning density. 
                  (Ord. of 12-2-2002, § 70-94; Res. No. Z05-022, 9-19-2005) 
                  Sec. 70-95. - Buffers in residential districts. 
                  (a)  Applicability. This section shall apply to all new residential subdivision developments and additions thereto, where preliminary plat plans have not been approved prior to November 15, 2004. New phases that are being developed under a previously approved general development plan will have to meet this requirement for all phases that have not received preliminary plat approval prior to November 15, 2004. 
                  (b)  Purpose and intent. The following regulations are designed to promote the health, safety, order, aesthetics and general welfare by protecting incompatible uses of land, providing for a more attractive residential environment, to promote desirable living conditions and the sustained stability of neighborhoods, assuring adequate open space, and reducing noise, night lighting, odor, objectionable view, loss of privacy and other adverse impacts and nuisances through the use of residential buffers and landscaping. 
                  (c)  Submittal of buffer plans. A buffer plan shall be submitted to the planning and development department together with the preliminary plat. The buffer plan may be included on the preliminary plat. The following information shall be shown on the required plan: 
                  (1)  Clearly state what level of service will be provided to the development and what level of service will be provided to adjacent residential developments. 
                  (2)  Location and dimensions of areas to be buffer area. 
                  (3)  Delineation of buffer area as restricted easement of private lots or dedicated to the county. 
                  (d)  Level of service. Buffer areas shall be required between all developments served by a different level of public utilities. The levels of service of public utilities that may be provided are: 
                  (1)  Level 1—Individual well and septic system. 
                  (2)  Level 2—County water system and individual septic system. 
                  (3)  Level 3—County water system and county sewer system. 
                  (e)  Buffer area required. A minimum 20-foot natural or landscape-enhanced buffer shall be provided along side and rear property lines of development with differing levels of service. This buffer area may account for the land conservation area required by section 70-94 of this chapter. It is the responsibility of the developer to provide the required buffer area prior to final acceptance of the development by the county board of commissioners. 
                  (f)  Acceptable buffer. 
                  (1)  Natural buffer. In cases where the natural vegetation is mature enough to provide a solid visual buffer there should be no disturbance within the buffer area. If the buffer area is included within a private lot, a restrictive easement shall be recorded with the lot indicating the area of easement, restricting use of the easement, and requiring the easement to remain undisturbed. The restrictive easement shall state that failure to leave the buffer undisturbed shall result in the property owner being required to bring the buffer area into compliance with the following subsection (2). 
                  (2)  Landscape-enhanced buffer. In cases where the natural vegetation is not adequate to provide a solid visual buffer between developments then landscaping shall be required to supplement the natural vegetation. This landscaped buffer area shall consist of trees and shrubs that are indigenous to the area and tend to grow well. All existing vegetation shall not be disturbed. 
                  (g)  Installation and maintenance. The owner and/or user of the property shall be responsible for installing all required buffers and maintaining them in a neat and orderly appearance. Necessary trimming and maintenance shall be the responsibility of the property owner or user of the property to maintain the health of all plants, to provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance, and to assure that all buffers actually serve the purpose for which they were intended. In cases of noncompliance, the planning director, or his designee, shall be empowered to take action as provided by law to ensure maintenance of all plants and buffer areas. 
                  (h)  Miscellaneous requirements. 
                  (1)  No artificial plants, trees, ground cover or other artificial vegetation may be installed. 
                  (2)  Areas reserved for storm water detention/retention are not permitted within buffer areas. However, exceptions may be granted by the planning director, or his designee, if, after consultation with the manger of development services, no reasonable alternatives are available or undue hardship is shown. 
                  (i)  Modification of buffer requirements. The planning director, or his designee, may approve minor variations to the buffer requirement due to unusual topographic restraints, sight restrictions, siting requirements, preservation of existing stands of native trees or similar conditions. The buffer plan shall be submitted and specify the modifications requested and present a justification for such modifications.

                  Sec. 70-97. - Fences. 
                  Walls or fences shall be permitted in any zoning district and are not subject to setback requirements, except that in a residential zoning district: 
                  (1)  No wall or fence shall exceed eight feet in height within a side yard or rear yard. 
                  (2)  Any wall or fence that extends into the front yard shall not exceed four feet in height, except fences enclosing stormwater facilities that may not exceed six feet in height. Any wall or fence that extends into the front yard shall not encroach upon the right-of-way. 
                  (3)  Fences enclosing tennis courts may not exceed 12 feet in height. 
                  (4)  No wall or fence constructed of woven wire or metal fabric (hog wire, barbed wire, or similar types of fencing.) shall extend into a front yard, except fences enclosing stormwater facilities that may be vinyl coated chain link. No wall or fence shall be constructed of exposed concrete block, tires, junk, wooden pallets, or other discarded materials. Chain link fences are expressly allowed in front yards. 
                  (5)  Any wall or fence that extends into the required front yard shall be ornamental or decorative and constructed of brick, stone, wood, stucco, wrought iron, split rail, or similar material. 
                  (6)  Any subdivision entrance, wall or fence shall not exceed eight feet in height and shall be subject to approval of the director of planning. 
                  (7)  Above-ground electric and barb wire fences shall be prohibited in residential districts except on lots that meet or exceed the minimum requirements for the raising and keeping of livestock (five acres) and then must only be located in the rear yard. 
                  (8)  For the purpose of measuring the height of a fence under this section, such measurements shall be made from the ground directly below the fence and not from the bottom of the fence itself.

                  Sec. 70-98. - Sidewalks. 
                  (a)  Sidewalks shall be located: 
                  (1)  Along the street frontage of all non-residential developments. The planning director may waive the installation of sidewalks if the development is agricultural or located on a rural road section. 
                  (2)  Along the street frontage of all developments within a one-half mile radius of any public school. 
                  (2)  Along the interior streets of all residential developments with a minimum lot size of three-quarters acre or smaller. 
                  (b)  Sidewalks shall be installed on one side of the street if there are fewer than 100 homes in the entire development. Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of the street if there are more than 100 homes in the entire development. The total number of lots in a development shall be calculated using all phases of the development, including phases already completed, phases included on the approved general development plan, and phases completed by other developers with the same subdivision name. 
                  (c)  Sidewalks in subdivisions shall be continued to the nearest arterial street. 
                  (d)  Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with Chapter 38, Land Development, section 38-331. 
                  (e)  The home builder shall install sidewalks along the entire frontage of each permitted dwelling prior to the certificate of occupancy (CO) being issued for the residence. Prior to commence of construction of the residential development, the developer of the residential subdivision shall post a bond in the estimated amount of 125 percent of the total cost of the sidewalk construction and installation for a period of two years from the date that such bond that such bond is posted. At the expiration of the two-year period, sidewalks shall be constructed by the developer in front of any lots where sidewalks have not already been installed by the home builder. Any damage to existing sidewalks caused by the developer or the home builder, or their respective agents or subcontractors, during construction on individual lots shall be repaired by the individual lot permit holder prior to a certificate of occupancy being issued for the residence being constructed. All repairs shall be in accordance with section 38-331.

                  Sec. 70-126. - Statement of purpose. 
                  This district is composed of certain areas having both rural and single-family residential characteristics and areas where it is desirable and likely that similar development will occur in the future. The district is also characterized by very low density of housing and large lot sizes, as well as uses that are associated with rural areas. It is designed to accommodate residential development opportunities for those who desire exurban, low density, or estate living and are willing to live in more remote locations and to assume the costs of providing many of their own services and amenities. The public provision of these amenities is precluded because the county must concentrate its limited resources in areas where more intense future development is logical. The low intensity allowed in this district is similarly necessitated by the county's need to preserve and support the existing public infrastructure. Accordingly, capital improvements such as such as highways and major sewer interceptors should be directed away from this district. The low densities permitted in this district generally permit on-site septic systems and wells, thereby reducing public capital expenditures.

                  (1)  The keeping, breeding or training of any animals for monetary gain or profit shall be deemed a commercial business and is expressly prohibited in all residential districts except where such operations may qualify as a non-conforming use as defined in this chapter. 
                  (2)  No keeping of horses shall become a nuisance as defined in the county nuisance ordinance.

                  ARTICLE VI. - R-2 MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT 

                  Sec. 70-196. - Statement of purpose. 
                  The R-2, multi-family residential district is designed to permit residential use of land with various types of multiple dwellings and related uses. For good accessibility, this district shall be located adjacent to arterial and/or collector roads as described in chapter 38 of this Code. Public water and sewer shall be required. Any developments in this district shall be designed to complement adjacent, existing or planned, single-family developments. Various types and sizes of residential accommodations, for ownership or rental, would thereby be provided to meet the needs of the different age and family groups in the community without overtaxing existing community facilities, utilities or services. 
                  It is also the intention of this section to provide areas of sufficient size and allowing reasonable flexibility in design and orientation for the establishment of a structure or group of structures which include multiple dwellings designed in a planned unit development of more than one building on a given site. The requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings and individual lots of record would in certain cases of large scale development have results affording less protection to the public health, safety and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of these planned unit developments as special and particular land uses can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects on adjoining properties. This type of development will permit a creative approach to residential development. A planned unit development will provide for an efficient use of land potentially resulting in more economical networks of streets and utilities thereby lowering housing and other land development costs as well as enhancing the appearance of neighborhoods through the preservation of natural features and the provision of recreation areas and open space. 
                  In creating this zoning district the county intends to encourage home ownership; increase the variety of dwelling types in the housing market; and allow for innovative uses of real property which may not be suitable for development for other kinds of residential uses.

                  Sec. 70-260. - Statement of purpose. 
                  This district is composed of certain areas having both rural and single-family residential characteristics and areas where it is desirable and likely that similar development will occur in the future. The district is also characterized by very low density of housing as well as permitting uses that are associated with rural areas. It is designed to accommodate residential development opportunities for those who desire exurban, low density, or estate living and are willing to live in more remote locations and to assume the costs of providing many of their own services and amenities. The public provision of these amenities is precluded because the county must concentrate its limited resources in areas where more intense future development is logical. The low intensity allowed in this district is similarly necessitated by the county's need to preserve and support the existing public infrastructure. Accordingly, capital improvements such as highways and major sewer interceptors will be directed away from this district. The low densities permitted in this district generally permit on-site septic systems and wells, thereby reducing public capital expenditures.

                  ARTICLE X. - AG-1 ACTIVE AGRICULTURE DISTRICT 

                  Sec. 70-311. - Statement of purpose. 
                  The Ag-1, Active Agriculture district was established for the purpose of preserving, promoting, maintaining, and enhancing the use of land for commercial agricultural purposes, to prevent scattered and leap-frog non-farm growth, to protect and preserve natural resource areas and to stabilize increases in public expenditures for such public services as roads and road maintenance, police and fire protection, and schools. 
                  This district is designed to protect and preserve prime agricultural areas for continued agricultural and agriculturally oriented uses. Their loss cannot be readily compensated, since these prime agricultural areas are relatively scarce, particularly on the national level and other areas require more capitol energy and nutrients to provide equal productivity. For these reasons, land should not be converted from the AG-1 district to another zoning classification unless and until there is no other land available in the county to accommodate the nonagricultural uses. 
                  The standards and densities prescribed for this district are intended to preserve the open character of the area and thereby to protect the business of agriculture. This district is intended not to regulate agricultural uses, but to regulate those uses which threaten agriculture. The intent of these regulations for this district is to discourage subdivision of land for typical residential type lots requiring public services such as fire and police protection, paved roads, water, sewer, etc. 
                  This district is generally intended to apply to lands in productive farm operations including: 
                  (1)  Lands historically producing good crop yields or capable of such yields; 
                  (2)  Lands productive for dairying, livestock raising and grazing; 
                  (3)  Other lands which are integral parts of such farm operations; 
                  (4)  Land used to produce specialty crops such as cranberries, mint, sod, fruits and vegetables; and 
                  (5)  Lands capable of productive use through economically feasible improvements such as irrigation.

                  The neighborhood business district established in this article is intended to permit retail business, office, and service uses that are needed to serve adjacent residential areas. In order to promote such business development so far as is possible and appropriate in each area, uses are prohibited which would create hazards, offensive and loud noises, vibration, smoke, glare, heavy truck traffic, or late hours of operation. The intent of this district is also to encourage the concentration of local business areas in locations proposed in the future land use plan to the mutual advantage of both consumers and merchants and thereby promote the best use of land at certain strategic locations and avoid the continuance of encouraging marginal, strip business development along county roads.

                  The purpose of the general business district is to provide areas for development that permit a wider range of business and entertainment activities than that permitted in the neighborhood business district. The permitted uses would serve not only nearby residential areas, but also people further away. This district is intended for types of businesses and services usually found in major shopping centers and central business districts at the juncture of principal streets. These uses would generate larger volumes of vehicular traffic, would need more off-street parking and loading, and would require more planning to integrate such districts with adjacent residential areas.

                  Editor's note— Ord. of 9-28-2010 amended Art. XIX in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. XIX, §§ 70-641—70-653, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. of 12-2-02, §§ 70-641, 70-642, 70-644—70-653; Mo. of 6-20-2005; Res. No. Z05-030, 9-23-2005. 

                  Sec. 70-641. - Statement of purpose. 
                  In adopting these sign regulations, it is the intent and purpose of the Board of Commissioners of Lee County not to impose an outright ban on signs, but instead to: 
                  (1)  Balance the right of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  (2)  Further the objectives of the county's comprehensive land use planning; 
                  (3)  Protect the public health, safety and welfare; 
                  (4)  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
                  (5)  Maintain the historical and cultural heritage and image of the county; and 
                  (6)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  (7)  Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  (8)  Promote economic development and tourism; 
                  (9)  Protect private property values; and 
                  (10)  Ensure the fair consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
                  In accessing how to go about the above described task, the Lee County Board of Commissioners has given considerable weight and find the following to be relevant and useful to the Lee County Board of Commissioners concerning the size, location and quantity of sign structures within the county and must be regulated in order to achieve the above-stated intents and purposes: University of Georgia Land Use Clinic (2003, June 26); Sign Control on Rural Corridors: Model Provisions and Guidance, Wisconsin Department of Transportation (1994, December); Milwaukee County Stadium Variable Message Sign Study: Impacts of an Advertising Variable Message Sign on Freeway Traffic; Scenic America (2007); Billboards in the Digital Age: Unsafe (and Unsightly) at Any Speed; Scenic America Issue Alert, Nasar, Jack L. and Hong, Xiadong (1999, September); Visual Preferences in Urban Signscapes, Journal of Environment and Behavior, 31(5), 671-691; Office of Safety Research and Development, Federal Highway Administration (2001, September 11); Research Review of Potential Safety Effects of Electronic Billboards on Driver Attention and Distraction, U.S. Department of Transportation; New York State Department of State, Division of Local Government Services (2006, January); Municipal Control of Signs, James A. Coon Local Advertising in 268 U.S. Jurisdictions; Outdoor Advertising Association of America, Inc.; City Club of Portland (1996, September 6); Billboard Regulation in Portland, City Club of Portland Bulletin, 78(13), 1-40; Smiley, Alison and Persaud, Bhagwant, et al. (2205); Traffic Safety Evaluations of Video Advertising Signs, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 1937, 105-112. 
                  In adopting these sign regulations, the Lee County Board of Commissioners has carefully considered and especially recognize the case law coming from Georgia courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the above-stated intents and purposes, and that such intents and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests, which include the following: Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., 193 Fed. Appx. 900 (C.A. 11th 2006) (finding that the stated goals within a sign ordinance of protecting against traffic hazards and the adverse impact on the count's aesthetic qualities are substantial government interests); Gregory v. Clive, 2007 WL 2914515 (Ga. S. Ct. 2007) (recognizing as within a local government's police power to enact legislation governing billboards and signs, as such legislation clearly addresses the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community); H and H Operations, Inc. v. City of Peachtree City, Ga., 248 Ga. 500 (1981) (holding that, under its police power, a municipality can enact and enforce reasonable regulations governing the erection and maintenance of signs within its jurisdiction); Harnish v. Manatee County, Florida, 783 F.2d 1535 (C.A. 11th 1986) (finding that aesthetics is a substantial governmental goal which is entitled to and should be according weighty respect, and that the governmental entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment must be given discretion in determining how much protection is necessary and the best method of achieving that protection); Lamar Advertising Company v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 254 F. Supp. 2d 1321 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (finding that where a sign ordinance asserts the goals of public safety, traffic safety, health, welfare and aesthetics, a municipality has shown an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech); Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) (holding that the goals of traffic safety and aesthetics advanced by a municipality as justification for regulating signs is a substantial governmental interest); St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269 (1919) (finding that billboards may be prohibited in the residential districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community); Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) (finding that a government entity can regulate signs and billboards when necessary to advance a significant and legitimate state interest, such as the protection of the aesthetics and quality of life within its jurisdiction); City of Doraville v. Turner Communications, Corp., 236 Ga. 385 (1976) (finding that under its police power authority, a municipality can regulate the location and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within their territorial jurisdiction); Spratlin Outdoor Media, Inc. v. City of Douglasville, 2006 WL 826077 (N.D. Ga. 2006) (upholding sign ordinance where the ordinance's height and setback restrictions were rationally related to its stated goals of promoting the health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, promoting the orderly and beneficial development of the city, promoting adequate access to natural light and air, improving the aesthetic appearance of the city, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan).

                  Sec. 70-643. - Permits, inspections, etc. 
                  (a)  Permit required . Except as otherwise provided herein, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, move, or convert any sign in the county or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a sign permit from the director of planning and engineering, chief building inspector, or their designees. These directives shall not be construed to require any permit for change of copy on any sign, replacement of the sign face, nor for the repainting, cleaning, or other normal maintenance or repair of a sign structure for which a permit has previously been issued, so long as the sign or sign structure is not modified or enlarged in any way. 
                  (b)  Application . Sign permits may be applied for by the owner of the property upon which the sign will be located, or by that person or entity's authorized agent. In order to obtain a permit to erect, alter or relocate any sign under the provisions of this article, an applicant therefore shall submit to the director of planning and engineering a sign permit application which shall set forth in writing a complete description of the proposed sign including: 
                  (1)  The name, address, and telephone number of the owner of persons entitled to possession of the sign and of the sign contractor or erector. 
                  (2)  The name, address and telephone number of the owner or lessee of the lot on which the sign is located if different from those designated above. 
                  (3)  The location by street address of the proposed sign structure. 
                  (4)  A drawing of the proposed sign showing dimensions and construction specifications. There may be circumstances such that in order to protect public health, safety and welfare the drawing must be prepared and signed by an architect or engineer licensed by the State of Georgia. This will be determined by the director of engineering and planning. 
                  (5)  Where the sign construction requires an electrical connection, the electrical contractor shall obtain an electrical permit. 
                  (6)  Each applicant shall present to the director of planning and engineering on request a certificate of liability insurance or current occupation tax certificate prior to the issuance of a sign permit. 
                  (7)  Where the application is for a multiple-message sign using electronic lighting as part of the display on the sign face, a copy of the sign manufacturer's specifications for luminosity shall be attached to the application. 
                  (c)  Issuance of permit if application in order. It shall be the duty of the director of planning and engineering, upon receipt of a completed application for a sign permit, to examine such plans and specifications and other data and, if the proposed structure is in compliance with the requirements of this section and all other applicable provisions of this article to issue, within five working days from date of filing, to the applicant a written permit evidencing the applicant's compliance therewith. Sign permits shall be issued in the name of the property owner upon which the sign is to be located. Issuance of the permit shall in no way prevent the director of planning and engineering from later declaring said sign to be nonconforming if the permit is obtained based on false information submitted by the applicant. 
                  (d)  Permit duration. A sign shall become null and void if the construction of the sign for which the permit was issued has not begun within a period of six months after the date of issuance and completed within 12 months after date of issuance. 
                  (e)  Work on illegal signs. No person shall erect or assist in the erection, construction, maintenance, alteration, relocation, repair or painting of, or do any work upon any sign for which a permit has not been obtained. Any such sign shall be illegal and the director of planning and engineering shall order the owner to remove the sign immediately. If the owner fails to remove the sign within 30 days, the director of planning and engineering shall proceed in accordance with this article. 
                  (f)  Inspection . All signs for which a permit is required by this article are subject to inspection by the director of planning and engineering, chief building inspector, or their designees. 
                  (g)  Revocation . The director of planning and engineering is hereby authorized and empowered to revoke any permit issued by him upon failure of the holder thereof to comply with the provisions of this section within ten days after notification in writing. 
                  (h)  Permit fees. Before any permit is issued under the provisions of this section, the applicant shall pay a fee as follows: 
                  (1)  For each permit for any sign in Lee County 37.5 cents/square foot of signage face or a minimum fee of $50.00, whichever is greater. 
                  (2)  A 150 percent permit fee shall be paid in addition to any other penalties levied for violation of this section. 
                  (i)  No permit should be required for signs having no electrical connection and a sign face less than 32 square feet in area; however, even signs not requiring a permit under this section shall be required to comply with the other provisions of this article.

                  (a)  If not otherwise stated, any sign not specifically permitted in a zoning district as provided under this section shall be prohibited. These regulations apply to signs located on any lot or development, except that any sign not visible from the outside of a structure or to passing members of the public is not restricted or regulated by this article. 
                  Sign height: Sign height is measured from centerline of street grade upon which the sign fronts to the highest portion of the sign structure. 
                  Sign face area: The area of a sign is calculated by determining the area of the smallest square or rectangle which encloses the sign face and the structure surrounding the sign face. For example, the pole or base would not be included, but any frame holding the sign face in place would be counted. See examples below. However, this example is not substantive regulation as to permissible types of signs:

                  (8)  A survey or plat showing the location of all sign structures on the lot upon which the subject sign is located; 
                  (9)  A statement from the signs owner of how long of an extension is anticipated to be needed in order to realize a reasonable return on the sign structure. 
                  (e)  Upon receipt of such application, the county commission shall conduct a hearing. The sign shall not be required to be removed or brought into conformity during the time the application is pending.

                  (f)  The application shall be granted if the extension is necessary for the property or sign owner to realize a reasonable return on the capital cost of the sign, or if the sign structure serves a commercial or non-commercial purpose which cannot be adequately achieved with conforming signage. In making this determination, the county commission shall consider the following factors: 
                  (1)  Can the sign structure be brought into conformity with the ordinance without having to be moved or removed? 
                  (2)  If the sign structure can be brought into conformity, what is the cost of doing so? 
                  (3)  If the sign structure can be brought into conformity, would the cost of doing so prevent a reasonable return of capital to the sign owner? 
                  (4)  If the sign cannot be brought into conformity and must be removed, has the owner realized a reasonable return on the capital cost in comparison to the reasonable investment expectations in the area? 
                  (5)  If the sign owner has not realize a reasonable return on the capital cost in comparison to the reasonable investment expectations in the area, what period of time would be necessary for the owner to receive a reasonable return of capital? 
                  (6)  Would the removal of the sign impair a commercial or non-commercial purpose which cannot be adequately achieved with conforming signage? 
                  Upon the conclusion of the evidence, the county commission may table the matter to a future meeting, or it may vote to deny the extension of time, grant the extension of time, or grant the extension of time subject to reasonable mitigating conditions. Any grant shall expressly state the duration of the additional time granted by the county commission. Such decision shall be reduced to writing and delivered to the applicant. 
                  (g)  Any person substantially aggrieved by the decision of the county commission may appeal to the Superior Court of Lee County by filing such appeal with the clerk of that court within 30 days of the county commission's decision. Upon the filing of such an appeal, the county attorney's office shall compile the record of the application and the hearing on that application, certify it, and shall file same with the superior court.

                  All public hearings on zoning matters shall be placed on the presiding commission's agenda under a section entitled "Public Hearings". After an initial presentation of a specific zoning request to the presiding commission by the designated county staff, citizen comments will be heard in an orderly fashion.

                  Citizens shall be allowed a minimum time period to be no less than ten minutes per side for presentation of data, evidence, and opinions by proponents of each zoning decision and for the presentation by opponents of each proposed zoning decision.

In such cases, these time limits shall apply to all speakers. 
                  Citizens shall address their comments to the presiding commission as a whole. Individual attacks or cross-examination of commission members, county employees, or other citizens will be ruled out of order.

                  If the planning commission is presiding over the hearing they may then vote on the application for a map or text amendment and forward their recommendation to the county commission. Failure of the planning commission to take action will result in no recommendation being forwarded to the board of commissioners at the official advertised public hearing.

Such disclosure shall include the name of the commissioner(s), the dollar amount, description, and date of each such campaign contribution. 
                  (d)  Public hearings records standards. The planning commission secretary and county clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of their respective public hearings. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but only if requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party. Recorded tapes of public hearings shall be kept secure and not erased for one year from the date of the public hearing. A summary of the proceedings of each meeting will be made available to the public within two working days after the meeting. The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular zoning amendment's file.

                  c.  If denied, will the effect on the applicant's property value under the existing zoning be offset by the gain to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public? 
                  d.  Has the property been undeveloped an unusual length of time as currently zoned, considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property? 
                  e.  Will the zoning proposal result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, schools, police protection, fire protection, public health facilities, or emergency medical services? 
                  f.  Is the zoning proposal in conformity with the policy and intent of the future land use plan for the physical development of the area? 
                  g.  Is the subject property well suited for the proposed zoning purpose? 
                  h.  Will the zoning proposal adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property? 
                  i.  Does the subject property have a reasonable economic use as currently zoned? 
                  j.  Are there other existing or changing conditions affecting the use or development of the subject property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal? 
                  k.  Would the change create an isolated district unrelated to the surrounding districts, such as "spot zoning"? 
                  l.  Are the present zoning district boundaries illogically drawn in relation to existing conditions in the area? 
                  m.  Is the change requested out of scale with the needs of the county as a whole or the immediate neighborhood? 
                  n.  Is it impossible to find adequate sites for the proposed use in districts permitting such use and already appropriately zoned? 
                  o.  Would there by an ecological or pollution impact resulting from the proposed zoning if it is granted?
