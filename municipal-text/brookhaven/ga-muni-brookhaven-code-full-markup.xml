PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Brookhaven, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. 
The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Kellyn Wilcox, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Susan D. Hiott, MMC, City Clerk, and to numerous other city department heads and staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

This section is enacted pursuant to the authority granted to the General Assembly under section 1 of that local constitutional amendment providing that certain municipalities in DeKalb County shall constitute special services tax districts, Resolution Act No. 168; House Resolution No. 715-1916; Ga. L. 1978, p. 2468, to control the subject matter of such local constitutional amendment. Municipal services provided by DeKalb County for the City of Brookhaven will be established through intergovernmental agreements or established as otherwise authorized by statute.

The ballot shall have written or printed thereon the words: 

                   
                  All persons desiring to vote for approval of the Act shall vote "Yes," and those persons desiring to vote for rejection of the Act shall vote "No." If more than one-half of the votes cast on such question are for approval of the Act, it shall become of full force and effect as provided in this Charter, otherwise it shall be void and of no force and effect. The initial expense of such election shall be borne by DeKalb County. Within two years after the elections if the incorporation is approved, the City of Brookhaven shall reimburse DeKalb County for the actual cost of printing and personnel services for such election and for the initial election of the mayor and councilmembers pursuant to section 2.02 of this Charter. It shall be the duty of the superintendent to hold and conduct such election. It shall be his or her further duty to certify the result thereof to the Secretary of State.

                  Section 6.03. - Effective dates and transition. 
                  (a)  The initial mayor and councilmembers shall take the oath of office the next business day after certification of the election of such officers, and by action of any three members of the governing authority may, prior to December 17, 2012, meet and take actions binding on the city. 
                  (b)  A period of time will be needed for an orderly transition of various government functions from DeKalb County to the City of Brookhaven. Accordingly there shall be a two-year transition period as allowed by law beginning at 12:01 a.m. on December 17, 2012. 
                  (c)  During such transition period, DeKalb County shall continue to provide within the territorial limits of the city all government services and functions which DeKalb County provided prior to such date in 2012 and at the same actual direct cost and level of service, except to the extent otherwise provided in this section; provided, however, that upon at least 30 days' prior written notice to the governing authority of DeKalb County by the governing authority of City of Brookhaven, responsibility for any such service or function shall be transferred to the City of Brookhaven. The governing authority of the City of Brookhaven shall determine the date of commencement of collection of taxes, fees, assessments, fines, and forfeitures, and other moneys within the territorial limits of the city and the date upon which the City of Brookhaven is considered removed from the special tax district. 
                  (d)  During the transition period, the governing authority of the City of Brookhaven may generally exercise any power granted by this Charter or general law, except to the extent that a power is specifically and integrally related to the provision of a governmental service, function, or responsibility not yet provided or carried out by the city. 
                  (e)  During the transition period, all ordinances of DeKalb County shall remain applicable within the territorial limits of the city unless otherwise amended, repealed, or replaced by the City of Brookhaven. Any transfer of jurisdiction to the City of Brookhaven during or at the end of the transition period shall not in and of itself abate any judicial proceeding pending in DeKalb County or the pending prosecution of any violation of any ordinance of DeKalb County. 
                  (f)  During the transition period, the governing authority of the City of Brookhaven may at any time, without the necessity of any agreement by DeKalb County, commence to exercise its planning and zoning powers; provided, however, that the city shall give the county notice of the date on which the city will assume the exercise of such powers. Upon the governing authority of the City of Brookhaven commencing to exercise its planning and zoning powers, the Municipal Court of the City of Brookhaven shall immediately have jurisdiction to enforce the planning and zoning ordinances of the city. The provisions of this subsection shall control over any conflicting provisions of any other subsection of this section. 
                  (g)  Effective upon the termination of the transition period, subsections (b) through (f) of this section shall cease to apply except for the last sentence of subsection (e) which shall remain effective. Effective upon the termination of the transition period, the City of Brookhaven shall be a full functioning municipal corporation and subject to all general laws of this state. 
                  Section 6.04. - Directory nature of dates. 
                  It is the intention of the General Assembly that this Act be construed as directory rather than mandatory with respect to any date prescribed in this Act. If it is necessary to delay any action called for in this Act for providential cause, delay in securing approval under the federal Voting Rights Act, or any other reason, it is the intention of the General Assembly that the action be delayed rather than abandoned. Any delay in performing any action under this Act, whether for cause or otherwise, shall not operate to frustrate the overall intent of this Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing it is specifically provided that if it is not possible to hold the referendum election provided for in section 6.02 of this Act on the date specified in that section, then such referendum shall be held as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable but not later than 45 days after securing approval under the federal Voting Rights Act. If the referendum election provided for in section 6.02 of this Act is conducted on or before August 21, 2012, the special election for the initial members of the governing authority shall be conducted on the date specified in section 2.02 of this Act. If the referendum election provided for under section 6.02 of this Act is conducted after August 21, 2012, then the special election for the initial members of the governing authority shall be held as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, and the commencement of the initial terms of office shall be delayed accordingly. If the first election provided for in section 2.02 of this Act occurs after the Tuesday following the first Monday in November 2012, the city council shall be authorized to delay the dates otherwise specified in section 6.03 of this Act. 
                  Section 6.05. - Charter commission. 
                  There shall be a Charter commission which shall periodically review the provisions of the city's Charter and the actual experience and operation of the city government and suggest and recommend to the mayor and council and to the General Assembly any changes to the Charter. Such suggestions and recommendations shall be contained in a written report to the mayor and council and to the legislative delegation representing the city. Members of the Charter commission shall begin the work of the Charter commission on July 1, 2017, and every five years thereafter, and shall be appointed as follows: one member shall be appointed by the mayor, one member shall be appointed by the city council, and one member shall be appointed by each member of the Georgia House of Representatives or Senate whose district lies wholly or partially within the corporate boundaries of the city, except for a state representative or state senator whose district contains only a road or a portion of a road in the City of Brookhaven. All members of the Charter commission must reside in the City of Brookhaven. Members shall be appointed not later than the first day of June of the year in which the Charter commission shall undertake its review. At the first meeting of the Charter commission, the members shall select from among their number a chairperson who shall preside over the meetings of the Charter commission. The commission shall complete its review of the Charter provisions and the actual operation of the city government and submit its written report not later than December 31 of the year in which the Charter commission is formed.

                  Section 6.06. - Severability. 
                  In the event any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Act shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the other sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this Act, which shall remain of full force and effect, as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase so declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The General Assembly hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this Act if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional. 
                  Section 6.07. - Effective date. 
                  This Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming law without such approval. The boundaries of the proposed City of Brookhaven shall become effective upon the effective date of this Act for the purposes of annexation of territory by other municipalities and no portion of the territory within the proposed City of Brookhaven shall be subject to annexation as of the effective date of this Act. If the referendum provided for in section 6.02 fails, then such boundaries shall cease to exist and shall be subject to annexation by other municipalities. 
                  Section 6.08. - Repealer. 
                  All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.

                  (b)  The history or source notes appearing in parentheses after sections in this Code are not intended to have any legal effect but are merely intended to indicate the source of matter contained in the section. Cross references and state law references which appear after sections or subsections of this Code or which otherwise appear in footnote form are provided for the convenience of the user of this Code and have no legal effect. 
                  (c)  All references to chapters, articles or sections are to the chapters, articles and sections of this Code unless otherwise specified.

In the case of repealed chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances and resolutions, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from repealed pages affected thereby. The subsequent ordinances and resolutions as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances and resolutions until such time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted anew by the city council. Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: "Section ____________ of The Code of the City of Brookhaven, Georgia, is amended to read as follows:…." The new provisions may then be set out in full as desired. 
                  (b)  If a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added, the following language may be used: "The Code of the City of Brookhaven, Georgia, is amended by adding a section (or article or chapter) numbered to read as follows:…." The new section may then be set out in full as desired. 
                  (c)  All sections, articles, chapters or provisions desired to be repealed should be specifically repealed by section, article or chapter number, as the case may be. 
                  Sec. 1-8. - Supplementation of Code. 
                  (a)  Supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council or its designee. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
                  (b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
                  (c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the person authorized to prepare the supplement may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the person may: 
                  (1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;

                  It is unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with this Code in any manner except by ordinance or other official act of the mayor and council which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby.

                  The term "violation of this Code" does not include the failure of a city officer or city employee to perform an official duty unless it is provided that failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this section. 
                  (b)  Upon violation of this Code, a summons, citation or accusation shall be personally served upon an accused, and a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 or imprisonment in jail not to exceed 120 days, or a combination thereof may be imposed.

                  (d)  Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent equitable relief.

                  (c)  If the accused is the mayor or a member of city council, the following procedures shall apply: 
                  (1)  Whenever an elected official is accused of a violation of this chapter, said officer shall first be entitled to a written notice from the city specifying the ground or grounds for any sanction considered.

Both sides will then present witnesses, and the prosecutor will present witnesses prior to the official at issue. The prosecutor can also call rebuttal witnesses if deemed necessary. Both sides will also be able to present documents and tangible evidence prior to closing statements. Both sides will then conclude with 15 minute closing statements, with the prosecutor's closing statement first, unless some or all of the prosecutor's time is reserved for rebuttal. The presiding officer at the hearing will have discretion to grant additional time for opening and closing statements upon request and demonstrated reasons therefor, provided that the prosecutor and the official who is the subject of the hearing will be provided the same amount of time for opening statements and closing statements. Any legal authorities that the parties contend may apply to the issues in the case shall be provided by the parties to the city council at the hearing in photocopied form for the record, and all such legal authorities shall be interpreted and applied to the facts by the city council with the assistance of the hearing officer. 
                  (4)  The city shall utilize its subpoena power to compel the attendance of witnesses to testify at the public hearing at the request of either the prosecutor or the official who is the subject of the hearing. However, the city reserves the right to limit subpoenas based upon the perceived relevance of the testimony or the burden to the potential witnesses. Witnesses shall be sworn and under oath. 
                  (5)  The city shall utilize the Georgia Rules of Evidence during the hearing, except that the prosecutor may present summary evidence of findings based upon an investigation within the city government, provided that the investigator is present, either as a witness or as the prosecutor, in order to testify as to the method of investigation, the witnesses interviewed, the documents reviewed, and the reasons for the conclusions reached as a result of the investigation. Provided the above-referenced provisions are followed, the Georgia Rules of Evidence shall not otherwise bar such investigatory summaries of evidence from being considered by the governing body as evidence. 
                  (6)  Either side may cross-examine any witness, within the scope allowed by the Georgia Rules of Evidence, except that cross examination of witnesses will be limited to the scope of direct examination and examination relating to that witness' credibility. Witnesses shall not be harassed nor irrelevant matters inquired into on either direct or cross examination. 
                  (7)  The officer who is the subject of the hearing shall have the right to counsel during the hearing, and the city may also employ an attorney if necessary to present the evidence as prosecutor. 
                  (8)  The official who is the subject of the hearing may be removed from office by the vote of three councilmembers if, after the conclusion of the investigative hearing, those councilmembers find that by a preponderance of the evidence presented the official at issue violated 2.08 of the city charter or this chapter of the code of ordinances for the city. 
                  (9)  The hearing shall be open to the public, except for deliberations of council in executive session, as required by the Georgia Open Meetings Act. However, the city council reserves the right to remove any spectator who is loud or disruptive of the civility of the proceedings. 
                  (d)  Upon a final judgment and certification of the minutes of the meeting disposing of the matter, the city clerk shall serve the respondent with a copy of the certified minutes and findings and recommendations by personal service, certified mail, return receipt requested, or by Federal Express or other overnight delivery service.

                  Sec. 2-381. - Right to appeal. 
                  (a)  Any member or complainant adversely affected by the findings or recommendations of the city council may obtain judicial review of such decision as provided in this section. 
                  (b)  An action for judicial review may be commenced by filing an application for a writ of certiorari in the superior court of the county within 30 days after the final action on a complaint pursuant to this article. The filing of such application shall act as supersedeas.

Abandonment also means the act of placing an animal on public property or within a public building, unattended or uncared for, or on or within the private property of another without the express permission of the owner, custodian or tenant of the private property.

It should also be clean, dry and compatible with current weather conditions, in addition to age, size, species and condition of the animal. The structure should be of sufficient size to allow the animal to stand, turn around, lie down and go in and out of the structure comfortably. To be adequate, some type of bedding that is quick drying, such as hay or pine straw, must be provided to maintain comfortable temperatures within the structure during times when the ambient, outside temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the structure shall include a heavy plastic or rubber flap to cover the door and/or window openings during the months of December through March or when the ambient, outside temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. From April through November, the structure shall either be shaded or moved out of direct sunlight. If the shelter is made of wood, it shall be raised at least two inches off the ground to prevent seepage or rotting. Examples of inadequate shelter include, but are not limited to, lean-tos, metal or plastic drums, boxes, abandoned vehicles, porches, decks, or material that does not provide sufficient protection from the elements.

                  Sec. 11-41. - Appeals. 
                  (a)  Appeals process. Assessments of civil penalties and other enforcement decisions made under this article may be appealed by filing a written notice of appeal with the police chief within ten days after the date of notification of the assessment of civil penalties or other enforcement decision. The written notice of appeal shall contain the cause for the appeal and any other pertinent information relevant to the case. The failure to give notice of appeal within this time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the assessment of penalties or other enforcement decisions. The police chief shall designate a hearing officer from the police department to hear appeals. The hearing officer shall render a decision within five business days and give written notice of her/his decision, based solely on the written record. No right of personal appearance or oral argument is granted. The hearing officer's decision may be appealed to the police chief by filing a written notice of appeal within ten days of the decision of the hearing officer. The chief shall have the final decision in this matter. A further review may be sought by filing a writ of certiorari in the Superior Court of DeKalb County.

The hearing officer shall review an appeal from the assessment of civil penalties or other enforcement decisions using a preponderance of the evidence standard. Notwithstanding a determination that the preponderance of the evidence supports the assessment of civil penalties or other enforcement decision, the hearing officer shall have the discretion to dismiss or reduced civil penalties or reverse any other enforcement decisions where warranted. In the discretion of the city attorney, the city shall have the right to seek review of any change or reduction in civil penalty or other enforcement decision to the police chief. If the hearing officer's determination is upheld, the city shall have no other right of review. 
                  (c)  Responsibility for fees/costs. In the event the appeal is not upheld, the owner or alarm company shall be responsible for any fee assessed to reimburse the city for any costs incurred by the hearing officer in enforcing this division.

                  (b)  Governmental immunity. Alarm registration is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty, or obligation, either express or implied, of response. Any and all liability and consequential damages resulting from the failure to respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By applying for an alarm system registration, the alarm user acknowledges that the police department may be influenced by factors such as: the available of responding units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels, and prior response history. 
                  (c)  Severability. The provisions of this article are severable. If a court determines that a word, phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, subsection, section or other provision is invalid or that the application of any part of the provision to any person or circumstance is invalid, the remaining provisions and the application of those provisions to other persons or circumstances are not affected by that decision.

                  (a)  Notice of violation. Whenever the community development director determines that development activity or inactivity on a property does not comply with the approved development and construction plans, that approved and required erosion and sedimentation control facilities or devices have been altered, damaged or destroyed, or that any other activities violate the provisions of this article, the community development director shall issue a notice of violation. Whenever the community development director determines that the drainage system has been unlawfully altered, causing inadequate drainage, the community development director or designee shall issue a notice of violation. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to any other penalty provisions applicable to this article. The notice of violation of the provisions of this article or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant hereto shall be addressed to the owner of the property or the owner's agent and to the person, tenant, firm, corporation, property owner or property owner's agent found to be violating the provisions of this article and shall: 
                  (1)  Be in writing; 
                  (2)  Include a description of the property sufficient for identification of where the violation has occurred; 
                  (3)  List the specific provisions of this article which have been violated; 
                  (4)  State that, if these repairs, construction or alterations are not completed within a reasonable time period specified by the inspector, summons shall be issued for the person, firm, corporation, owner, or owner's agent to appear in municipal court. However, in the judgment of the community development director, where the violation is willful, in wanton disregard of the provisions of this article or constitutes a public health and safety hazard or endangers the ecosystem, the community development director may issue a court summons in lieu of a notice of violation. 
                  (b)  Penalty. It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to do anything prohibited or fail to do anything required by the provisions of this article, as they now exist or as they may hereafter be amended. Any person, firm or corporation that shall do anything prohibited or fail to do anything required by the provisions of this article, as they now exist or as they may hereafter be amended, upon conviction of a violation in municipal court shall be subject to a fine or imprisonment in accordance with section 1-11. Where any offense or violation continues from day-to-day, each day's continuance thereof shall be deemed a separate offense. The owner of any buildings or premises or parts thereof, where anything in violation of this article exists, and any architect, builder, engineer, contractor, or any other agent of the owner, or any tenant, who commits, or assists in the commission of any violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense. 
                  (c)  Variances. 
                  (1)  Except as further limited herein, an applicant may request a variance from the terms of the requirements of sections 14-28, 14-29, 14-78, 14-79 and article V of this chapter. The community development director shall have no power to consider or to grant variances which are the responsibility of the director of the EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 and other relevant state statutes and regulations. Where variances involving the same project are requested from both the director of the EPD and the community development director, the community development director shall take no action on any such request for variance until the director of the EPD grants the variance or otherwise approves the request pending before the EPD. Receiving a variance from the director of the EPD does not obligate the community development director to permit the project to proceed if the project does not also meet all the other requirements of this article. No variance from the provisions of this chapter shall be authorized except as specifically authorized in this section or specifically authorized in another section of this chapter. 
                  (2)  Applications for variances authorized in subsection (c)(1) of this section shall be made in writing to the community development director and shall contain all of those materials and documents required by the community development director that are necessary to demonstrate that the request meets the criteria for granting variances. 
                  (3)  In considering a request for a variance to the terms of this article authorized in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the community development director shall use all of the following criteria: 
                  a.  The request, while not strictly meeting the requirements of this chapter, will in the judgment of the community development director be at least as protective of natural resources and the environment as would a plan which met the strict application of these requirements. In making such a judgment, the community development director shall examine whether the request will be at least as protective of the natural resources and the environment with regard to the following factors: 
                  1.  Stream bank or soil stabilization; 
                  2.  Trapping of sediment in surface runoff; 
                  3.  Removal of nutrients, heavy metals, pesticides and other pollutants from surface runoff; 
                  4.  Terrestrial habitat, food chain, and migration corridor; 
                  5.  Buffering of flood flows; 
                  6.  Infiltration of surface runoff; 
                  7.  Noise and visual buffers; 
                  8.  Downstream water quality; and 
                  9.  Impact on threatened and endangered species, as those species are designated by law or federal or state regulation. 
                  b.  By reason of exceptional topographic or other relevant physical conditions of the subject property that were not created by the owner or applicant, there is no opportunity for any development under any design configuration unless a variance is granted. 
                  c.  The request does not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief and does not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties that are similarly situated. 
                  d.  The grant of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the area in which the property is located. 
                  e.  The literal interpretation and strict application of the applicable provisions or requirements of this chapter would cause an extreme hardship, provided the hardship was not created by the owner. 
                  (4)  The community development director's decision shall be in writing, shall state the basis for the decision, and shall be made no more than 30 days following application. 
                  (d)  Appeals. 
                  (1)  Generally. Appeals shall be made to the zoning board of appeals, as established in chapter 27 of this Code, and shall be administered in accordance with the notice requirements, criteria and procedural requirements set forth therein, except as otherwise specified below. 
                  (2)  Basis for appeal. Whenever the community development director approves a variance pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and it is alleged that the variance request did not meet the standards of the section, or where the community development director denies a variance request pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and it is alleged that the variance request did meet the standards of the section, or where it is alleged by the applicant that there is an error in any final order, requirement, or final decision made by an administrative official based on or made in the interpretation or enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved person, or any city official, department, board or agency affected by the order, requirement or decision, shall have the right to appeal the final order, requirement or decision to the zoning board of appeals. 
                  (3)  Initiation of appeal. Appeals shall be made by filing with the secretary of the zoning board of appeals an application for appeal specifying the grounds thereof, within 30 days after the action appealed from was taken. 
                  (4)  Appeal stays all legal proceedings. An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the zoning board of appeals, after notice of appeal has been filed, that by reasons of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in that official's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such a case, proceedings shall be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the superior court of the county on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. 
                  (5)  Time and notice of hearing. The zoning board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for hearing of the appeal and shall give notice thereof pursuant to the requirements of section 27-1666. 
                  (6)  Decision of the zoning board of appeals. Following the consideration of all testimony, documentary evidence, and matters of record, the zoning board of appeals shall make a determination on each appeal. The zoning board of appeals shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time but in no event more than 60 days from the date of the final hearing. An appeal shall be sustained only upon an express finding by the zoning board of appeals that the administrative official's action was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or that the administrative official acted in an arbitrary manner. In exercising its powers, the zoning board of appeals may reserve or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit provided all requirements imposed by all other applicable laws are met. 
                  (e)  Appeals of final decisions. All appeals of final decisions of the zoning board of appeals under the provisions of this article shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  Any person aggrieved by a final decision of the zoning board of appeals, or any officer, department, board or agency affected by such decision, may seek review of such decision by petitioning the superior court of the county for a writ of certiorari, setting forth plainly the alleged errors. Such petition shall be filed within 30 days after the final decision of the zoning board of appeals is rendered. 
                  (2)  In any such petition filed, the zoning board of appeals shall be designated the respondent in certiorari and city shall be designated the defendant in certiorari. The secretary of the zoning board of appeals shall be authorized to acknowledge service of a copy of the petition and writ for the zoning board of appeals as respondent. Service upon the city as defendant shall be as otherwise provided by law. Within the time prescribed by law, the zoning board of appeals shall cause to be filed with the clerk of the county superior court a duly certified record of the proceedings had before the board, including a transcript of the evidence heard before it, if any, and the decision of the board. 
                  (f)  Private agreements, covenants, and restrictions. This article is not intended to abrogate, annul or otherwise interfere with any easement, covenant or other private agreement or legal relationship provided that when the regulations of this article are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such easements, covenants, or other private agreements or legal relationships, the regulations of this article shall govern. Further, where there is a conflict between any standard or requirement within this chapter, or between the standards of this chapter and any other provision of the Code, the more restrictive standard or requirement shall apply.

When the hydrologic engineering analysis includes applications of the principles for flood routing, super critical flow, high energy dissipation or conversion, backwater curves, floodplain studies or other advanced hydrologic engineering techniques, the analysis shall be made by a currently state-registered professional engineer proficient in hydrology. 
                  (e)  Site plans and supporting documentation to show conformance with this article shall be submitted in accordance with the applicable provisions of chapter 27 and all conditions of zoning and shall include the following: 
                  (1)  Evidence of conformance with the requirements of this article for grading, vegetation alteration, erosion control, sedimentation control, water quality control and drainage system alteration or development. Grading plans shall illustrate existing and proposed contours to the two-foot interval at a minimum; golf courses and other open space areas shall be exempt from this requirement but general grading plans for golf courses and other open space areas shall be submitted. Water quality plans shall include the identification of existing wetland areas within the development site and shall demonstrate use of the stormwater quality site development review tool. Related plans shall show locations of structures, roads, surface drainage, existing and proposed drainage conduits, buffer areas, stream buffers, state buffer zones, and proposed alterations to the existing site; 
                  (2)  A hydrologic engineering analysis of stormwater runoff under pre-developed and post-developed site conditions and a detailed evaluation of the projected effects on upstream and downstream properties within the affected drainage basin. In determining downstream effects from stormwater management structures, BMPs, and the development, hydrologic-hydraulic engineering studies shall extend downstream to a point where the proposed development represents less than ten percent of the total watershed. This analysis shall include a determination of the culvert, floodplain and channel cross-section area required to carry the affected runoff at the intermediate regional flood stage level. The requirement for a complete hydrologic study may be waived in writing by the community development director for any development where the site plan submitted illustrates predeveloped or proposed improvements sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable provisions of this article; 
                  (3)  Delineation of the boundaries, contour elevations and floodways of the intermediate regional floodplain for streams draining in excess of 100 acres. Unless shown on the flood hazard map, the intermediate regional flood contour elevations and floodways shall be established by engineering field control surveys and then be added to the flood hazard map upon approval of the community development director and be clearly designated on each site plan, subdivision plat and construction plan. The actual building site in relation to the intermediate regional floodplain boundaries shall be shown; the same information shall be indicated by the seller to the purchaser of each property so affected. The elevation contours representing the intermediate regional flood conditions shall be shown when they are located outside established ditch banks. A benchmark suitable for determining intermediate regional flood elevations shall be established; 
                  (4)  The projected sequence of work represented by the grading, vegetation, erosion control, sedimentation control, water quality control and drainage plans as related to other major items of construction; 
                  (5)  Upon development project completion, location, size and invert elevations of piped segments of the storm drainage system, of control weirs, BMPs and water surface elevations and volumes in detention ponds shall be shown on the final plat for a subdivision, and on a final plan for other developments which shall be submitted to the community development director prior to approval. The currently state-registered professional engineer, architect or landscape architect reviewing the construction shall provide a certificate that the development is in substantial compliance with approved plans. As-built elevation certifications prepared by currently state-registered land surveyors or currently state-registered professional engineers for all developments, including fill, allowed within a floodprone area, shall be submitted to the community development director; and

                  (b)  Standards. 
                  (1)  General requirements. Any land-disturbing activity permitted under this chapter shall be carried out in accordance with the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended; this chapter; and the permit conditions specified by the community development director. 
                  (2)  Minimum requirements. Nothing contained in state law or this chapter shall prevent the issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements contained in this section or in state law. 
                  (3)  Exemptions. This section shall apply to any land-disturbing activity undertaken by any person on any land except for the following: 
                  a.  Surface mining, as the same is defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-4-72, a part of the Georgia Surface Mine Act of 1968; 
                  b.  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying; 
                  c.  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
                  d.  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this section; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in subsection (b)(4) of this section. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this section, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the community development department may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of subsection (b)(4) of this section and the buffer zones provided by this section shall be enforced by the development department; 
                  e.  Agricultural operations; 
                  f.  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; providing, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in subsections (b)(4)c.15 and 16 of this section, no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  g.  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the natural resources conservation service of the federal department of agriculture; 
                  h.  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this section, "state waters" excludes channels and drainageways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainageway, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent city from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by subsections (b)(3)a—g, i, or j of this section; 
                  i.  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the state highway authority, or the state tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any city or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of department of transportation or state tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7.2; except where the department of transportation, the state highway authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  j.  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and 
                  k.  Any public water system reservoir. 
                  (4)  Minimum requirement for soil erosion and control and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  a.  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities that are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosions and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b)(4)b and c of this section and any other applicable provision of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, stormwater management facilities, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with the requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. The community development director may require that land disturbance activity be phased. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall address appropriate measures to effectively control soil erosion during successive phases of construction. 
                  b.  Minimum requirements. 
                  1.  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b)(4)b and c of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design by phases, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director of the environmental protection division (EPD) or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(4)b.2 of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  2.  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the EPD. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  4.  The director of the EPD may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the BNR, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  c.  Rules and regulations governing land-disturbing activities. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, at a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  1.  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  2.  Cut-fill operations shall be kept to a minimum; 
                  3.  Development plans shall conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented as provided in articles III and V of this chapter; 
                  5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  11.  Cuts and fills shall not endanger adjoining property; 
                  12.  Fills shall not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  13.  Grading equipment shall cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  14.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediment on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(4)b.2 of this section; 
                  15.  Except as provided in subsection (b)(4)c.16 of this section, there is established a 25-foot state buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director of the EPD determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director of the EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-5 et seq., shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director of the EPD as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  (i)  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quality to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  (ii)  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  A.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  B.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; 
                  16.  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the BNR, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director of the EPD may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  (i)  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  (ii)  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  A.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  B.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  d.  Land disturbance resulting in injury to property of another. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this section or the terms of the permit. 
                  (5)  Application/permit process. 
                  a.  Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the local issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner or operator is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
                  b.  Application requirements. 
                  1.  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of city without first obtaining a permit from the community development department to perform such activity, and providing a copy of the notice of intent, if applicable, to the EPD. 
                  2.  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the community development department and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, at a minimum, the data specified in subsection (b)(5)c of this section. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's soil erosions and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD rule 391-3-7-.10 (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. 391-3-7-.10). 
                  3.  A permitting fee, as determined by the city council shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  4.  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  5.  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the community development department. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection (b)(4)c.15 and 16 of this section and bonding if required by subsection (b)(5)b.7 of this section have been obtained. Such review will not be required if city and the district enter into an agreement which allows city to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  6.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this chapter, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the community development department may deny the permit application. 
                  7.  The community development department may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the city manager may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  c.  Plan requirements. 
                  1.  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsection (b)(4)b and c of this section, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  2.  Data required for the site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  d.  Permits. 
                  1.  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the community development department of a completed application, provided variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary; no permit may be issued unless all applicable fees have been paid. 
                  2.  No permit shall be issued by the community development department unless the erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved by the district and the community development department has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by subsection (b)(4)c.15 and 16 of this section are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(5)b.7 of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of city are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  3.  Any land-disturbing activity by the governing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this section, and any other ordinances relating to land development as are applied to private persons, and the community development director shall enforce such requirements upon the governing authority. 
                  4.  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  5.  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by city, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  6.  No permit shall be issued until the applicant files documents with the community development department demonstrating compliance with all applicable local, state and federal requirements. 
                  7.  A development permit shall be valid for two years from its issuance subject to the following provisions: 
                  (i)  If the work authorized in any development permit has not begun within 90 days from the date of issuance thereof, the permit shall expire.

                  (iv)  The city engineer is authorized to grant one written extension of a development permit for a period of not more than 90 days. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. 
                  (6)  Inspection and enforcement. 
                  a.  The community development department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the city shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbance activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this section, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person by the community development department. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this section. 
                  b.  The community development department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as may reasonably be necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this section, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  c.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city, the commission, the district, or the division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  d.  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of the city. The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to city for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the city's erosion and sedimentation control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if the city's program is found to be deficient or ineffective. 
                  e.  The division may periodically review the actions of the city which has been certified as a local issuing authority pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of city's ordinances and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and city. If such review indicates that city has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the city governing authority in writing. Upon receipt of the notification, the governing authority shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the city does not take necessary action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division may revoke the certification of city as a local issuing authority. 
                  (7)  Penalties and incentives. 
                  a.  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining the permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within unincorporated city. 
                  b.  Stop work orders. Upon notice from the community development department or other city-authorized representative, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, shall be immediately stopped. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required. 
                  1.  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this section on a site, the community development department shall issue a written notice of violation. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the community development department shall issue a stop work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided that if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state, the community development department shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning. 
                  2.  For a third and each subsequent violation on a site, the community development department shall issue an immediate stop work order; and 
                  3.  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  4.  When a violation in the form of land disturbance without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the community development department, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the community development department. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  c.  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served by the community development department upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection (b)(5)b.7 of this section. The city manager may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  d.  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this section, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this section, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the community development department issued as provided in this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day, or the maximum amount authorized by section 1-11. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of city ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought under city ordinances approved under this section shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation; however the maximum assessment shall not exceed the amount authorized by section 1-11. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation. 
                  (8)  Education and certification. 
                  a.  Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection of any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  b.  For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of the entity or person; the persons shall meet the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission, and maintain evidence of the certification present whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on the site. A project shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site, or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale, permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 
                  c.  Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit, but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site, may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this section. 
                  d.  If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(4), but shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in the paragraph. 
                  (9)  Administrative appeal, judicial review. 
                  a.  Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the city upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan, or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to an appeal before the zoning board of appeals pursuant to the procedures and standards set forth in section 14-26(d). 
                  b.  Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by administrative appeals from a decision or order of the zoning board of appeals authorized by subsection (b)(9)a of this section shall be as provided for in section 14-26(d). 
                  (10)  Liability. 
                  a.  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this section nor the compliance with provisions of this section shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon city, the district, its officers or employees for damage to any person or property. 
                  b.  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this section or the terms of the permit. 
                  c.  No provision of this section shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

                  Secs. 14-30—14-46. - Reserved. 
                  ARTICLE III. - TREE PRESERVATION AND MAINTENANCE 

                  Sec. 14-47. - Purpose and intent; applicability. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose and intent of this article is to protect the rights of property owners and to facilitate and promote canopy preservation and tree replacement as an integral part of the land development and construction process in the city with the goal of maintaining a sustainable tree canopy. The aesthetics of urban forests as well as the many environmental benefits provide both economic and ecological vitality to the city and its citizens. 
                  (b)  Findings. The citizens and their many communities enjoy the following benefits that can be directly attributed to our trees: 
                  (1)  Trees produce oxygen, which is essential to the well-being of all animal life, including humans. 
                  (2)  Trees help to reduce the amounts of airborne pollutants. For example, trees remove carbon dioxide which is a major environmental concern due to its current high levels. 
                  (3)  Trees are critical in cooling the urban "heat island" effect and help moderate our air temperature in general to provide us with a more comfortable environment. 
                  (4)  Trees and their foliage intercept dust and particulate matter, thereby helping to purify our air and limiting health risks. 
                  (5)  Trees and their root systems reduce soil erosion and stormwater runoff. This decreases sedimentation problems and improves water quality. 
                  (6)  Trees provide food and shelter for desirable urban wildlife. 
                  (7)  Trees provide screening which in turn aids in the reduction of noise and glare. 
                  (8)  Trees provide scenic amenities and shade to soften the harshness of city buildings and streets. They are aesthetically pleasing to all that view them. 
                  (9)  Trees can enhance the natural functions of streams and related buffers. In furtherance of its purpose and intent, this article is designed to: 
                  a.  Protect specimen trees and historical trees in a manner consistent with this article. A link to the Georgia Urban Forest Council is provided where a map of state landmark and historic trees can be found: http://www.gufc.org/programs/landmark-and-historic-tree/ . 
                  b.  Provide standards for the preservation of trees as a part of the land development process. This includes discouraging clear cutting and mass grading of land that results in the loss of mature trees. 
                  c.  Provide standards for ecologically appropriate replanting when tree loss does occur. 
                  d.  Protect trees during construction, including the construction of public facilities, to enhance the quality of life in the city. 
                  e.  Maintain trees in a healthy and non-hazardous condition through good arboricultural practices such as proper pruning and mulching. 
                  f.  Establish and maintain appropriate diversity in tree species and age classes to provide a stable and sustainable urban forest. 
                  (c)  General applicability. 
                  (1)  This article shall only apply to any activity which requires the issuance of a permit or notice that includes land disturbance or, in the judgment of the city arborist, otherwise has an impact on trees. No such permit shall be issued until it is determined by the city arborist that the proposed activity conforms to the provisions of this article. 
                  (2)  This article applies to the development of all property lying within the city, inclusive of property owned by the city, its agencies, authorities and affiliated entities, except as otherwise provided in this article. 
                  (3)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit a property owner from pruning, maintaining or otherwise caring for trees on their property as needs require. 
                  (d)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

                  Boundary tree means a tree 15 inches DBH or larger located on any part of a property adjacent to a permitting property with any portion of the root plate extending into the permitting property. (See Root plate. ) Boundary trees must be in good health as determined from the vantage point of the property to be developed (pre-construction digital photographs required). This provision shall not authorize the trespass on private property abutting the site. 
                  Buffer means a naturally existing area, a landscaped area or a combination of both designated for screening or buffering incompatible uses. 
                  Buildable area means that area of the lot available for the construction of a dwelling, egress, and permissible accessory uses after having provided the required front, side and rear setbacks.

                  Hazardous tree means any tree determined by a certified arborist that is deemed to be in irreversible decline, is diseased, or poses a threat to life or property because of structural instability of the tree. 
                  Historic tree means any historic or landmark tree designated as such by the Georgia Urban Forest Council. 
                  ISA means the International Society of Arboriculture. 
                  Mature canopy size means the potential amount of canopy that can be expected for a species at maturity, categorized as small (400 square feet), medium (900 square feet) and large (1,600 square feet). 
                  Notice means any notice required by the provisions of this article. 
                  Overstory tree means those trees that compose the top layer or canopy of vegetation and will generally reach a mature height of greater than 40 feet. 
                  Permit means any tree removal permit, land disturbance permit, or building permit impacting trees. 
                  Pruning means pruning to elevate branches/limbs that are likely to be damaged by construction activities. Pruning shall not exceed 20 percent of the live crown. All pruning shall comply with ANSI Standard A300 (part 1) pertaining to pruning. 
                  Specimen tree means any tree described in section 14-51(b), which qualifies for special consideration for conservation due to its size, type, condition, location or historical significance. 
                  Tree means any living, self-supporting woody or fibrous plant which normally obtains a diameter breast height of at least three inches, and typically has one main stem, a trunk and many branches. 
                  Tree canopy cover means the amount of ground area directly beneath a tree's crown or the combined crowns of a stand of trees, measured in square feet. 
                  Tree fund means an account, maintained by the finance department of the city, of funds contributed as a form of alternative compliance to this article. Tree funds may be used for: 
                  (1)  The purchase and installation of trees in parks, right-of-ways and other city owned or leased property; 
                  (2)  Maintenance of city trees; and 
                  (3)  Promotion of a healthy urban forest. 
                  Tree protection and replacement plan, tree protection plan, and tree replacement plan has the meaning given to such terms in section 14-49(2). 
                  Tree save area means an area designated for the purpose of meeting tree density requirements, saving natural trees and/or preserving natural buffers. 
                  Trophic layer means the different levels of low-growing grasses, forbs (non-woody flowering plants other than grass) and other plants; small trees, bushes and/or shrubs; and canopy cover from medium to larger trees existing in a stream buffer. 
                  Understory tree means those trees that grow beneath the overstory trees and will generally reach a mature height of less than 40 feet. 
                  (Ord. No. 2014-07-07, 8-26-2014; Ord. No. 2015-02-01, § 1, 2-10-2015; Ord. No. 2015-08-01, 8-25-2015) 
                  Sec. 14-48. - Tree removal exemptions. 
                  The following shall be exempt from the provisions of this article: 
                  (1)  The removal of three six-inch DBH or greater trees, other than specimen trees, from an owner-occupied, single-family residential property within a single calendar year so long as a density factor of 60 DBH inches of trees per acre is maintained and provided a tree canopy reduction notice (with no fee) for documentation purposes is obtained from the community development department said tree reduction notice shall expire within 180 days and no extensions shall be granted. Trees less than six-inch DBH may be removed from an owner-occupied, single-family residential property without a permit, so long as a density factor of 60 DBH inches of trees per acre is maintained. Any newly planted trees shall be planted in a manner that provides adequate spacing for nourishment, light and maturation. All stream buffer and floodplain acreage shall be excluded when calculating the density factor requirement contained in this subsection. 
                  (2)  The removal of trees from golf courses and horticultural properties such as farms, nurseries or orchards except removal of trees from the state stream buffers or floodplains. 
                  (3)  The removal of any tree that is hazardous and becomes or threatens to become a danger to human life or property as defined in section 14-47. Prior to removal, or within three days after removal, the property owner must submit a hazardous tree determination from a certified arborist. There is no permit, notice or plant back requirement under this subsection.

                  (5)  Activities or trees described in a waiver issued by the city manager or his designee during and immediately after the period of an emergency such as a flood, ice storm, thunderstorm, windstorm, tornado, or any other disastrous act of nature. 
                  (Ord. No. 2014-07-07, 8-26-2014; Ord. No. 2015-02-01, § 1, 2-10-2015; Ord. No. 2015-08-01, 8-25-2015; Ord. No. 2017-08-07 , § I, 8-22-2017) 
                  Sec. 14-49. - Procedures and requirements. 
                  Notwithstanding the preservation of the specimen trees as provided herein, the city requires the preservation of trees outside of the site's buildable area having a density factor of not less than 120 DBH inches per acre or 45 percent canopy coverage with the disturbance of no more than 20 percent of the critical root zone of each tree to be preserved. 
                  (1)  Application requirements (tree survey). Except as provided elsewhere in this article, a tree survey is a required part of any application for a permit to remove or disturb trees or their CRZ within the city. Specimen trees, all trees eight inches DBH and larger, and all trees being counted toward the required density factor shall be identified by size, species, CRZ and location. The city arborist, with the approval of the director, may authorize in writing an alternative to the preparation of a tree survey where the applicant presents documentation by a partial tree survey or tree population inventory of the size, species and approximate critical root zone of trees other than specimen trees adjacent to limits of disturbance which demonstrates that the planned limits of construction will not reduce the tree density of the parcel below any required minimum of density. 
                  (2)  Tree protection and tree replacement plan requirements. A tree protection and replacement plan shall be submitted with any site plan, tree survey, land disturbance, construction and other plans required as part of the permitting process. Plans will not be accepted without a completed tree protection and replacement plan. The tree protection plan and the tree replacement plan should be separated into two plans if the overall plan requirements are too complex to be reflected on one plan. Otherwise, the tree protection plan and the tree replacement plan may be on the same plan. The final decision of whether they are separate or combined is at the discretion of the city arborist. Tree protection and replacement plans shall include: 
                  a.  The identity of the tract of land, including the address, land lot and district and any adjacent roadways or other major identifying factors. 
                  b.  The name, address and telephone number of the owner, developer, landscape architect, surveyor, engineer and a 24-hour contact person; 
                  c.  Evidence that the plans conform to all applicable zoning conditions and any administrative guidelines. 
                  d.  All existing and proposed utility lines including but not limited to: overhead and underground power lines, easements, water lines, sewer lines and other utility lines. 
                  e.  The schedule for the implementation, installation, and maintenance of tree protection measures (the overall project schedule can be referenced, but must include tree protection measures). 
                  f.  The tree survey in the form of a to-scale map showing trees to be saved, Boundary trees and specimen trees with tree protection methods located at the critical root zone and all applicable details and calculations prepared and signed/sealed by a state registered surveyor or a state registered landscape architect. A certified arborist shall also review, approve and stamp the plan prior to submittal. The proposed tree protection fencing locations the requirements of any associated engineering grading/limits of disturbance plans. 
                  g.  The tree replacement plan prepared and signed/sealed by a state-registered landscape architect noting the location of all specimen trees to remain with critical root zone intact, boundary trees, and all other trees which will be conserved and/or planted to count toward meeting site tree density requirements. A certified arborist shall also review site trees and approve and stamp the plan prior to submittal. In addition, this plan will include all associated details, plant lists, inches required, specimen recompense calculations and any other applicable items as determined by the city arborist. 
                  (3)  Tree density requirements. 
                  a.  In connection with the permitting of land disturbance and the construction of improvements, the city requires the preservation of trees having a density factor of 120 DBH inches per acre and having a DBH of eight inches or greater with no more than 20 percent CRZ disturbance or 45 percent canopy coverage on the parcel. The only allowable exceptions are for sites having less than 120 DBH inches of trees or less than 45 percent canopy coverage before development, or only dead, dying or hazardous trees as verified by a certified arborist. For sites having less than 120 DBH inches per acre or 45 percent canopy coverage, see section 14-51(i) "Alternative compliance." Trees located within the buildable area of a site may be removed provided a density factor of 120 DBH inches of trees per acre or 45 percent canopy coverage is maintained. 
                  b.  Tree canopy cover. All existing healthy trees greater than eight inches DBH, with the exception of invasive and non-native, shall be eligible for tree canopy cover. The 45 percent of tree canopy cover on a site shall be measured in percent of the lot area that is covered by tree canopy, including canopy that projects over buildings and impervious surfaces. The canopy projected over and onto the applicant's property by a tree growing on a neighboring property or on the boundary between properties or on public property may be included in the measurement of tree canopy cover on a site. 
                  c.  Tree canopy cover preserved or planted to meet the requirements of tree density shall be conserved on the site for the following time period: 
                  1.  Commercial properties in perpetuity. 
                  2.  Residential properties for five years; after then the provision in section 14-48(1) shall be extended to the homeowner. 
                  d.  Required tree canopy cover lost over time due to natural causes, disease, or pests shall be replaced during the first planting season after the loss occurs with the same mature canopy size potential 2.5-inch caliper tree. 
                  (4)  Calculating tree density and individual tree canopy cover . The applicant shall provide a plan demonstrating both preservation and any required tree replacement on sites submitted for development. Trees within undisturbed zoning buffers and trees outside of stream buffers and floodplain areas may be counted toward the density and/or preservation requirement. All stream buffers and floodplain acreage shall be excluded from the site area tree calculations. 
                  a.  The required density of 120 DBH inches per acre may be achieved as follows: 
                  1.  Counting and measuring existing trees (inches measured at DBH) to be conserved. 
                  2.  The planting of new trees (minimum 2.5-inch caliper) for lots that do not have a density factor of 120 DBH inches per acre or 45 percent of canopy coverage. 
                  Formula: Acreage x 120 DBH inches = Required inches 
                  b.  The 45 percent canopy coverage shall be measured as follows: 
                  1.  The width of crown is measured at its widest point in feet (round to the nearest foot), as it is projected onto the ground. Then the width of the crown in a perpendicular (crosswise) direction is measured. Add these two crown widths (diameters) together and divide by two to get the average crown diameter, and by two again to get the average crown radius. This radius squared multiplied by 3.14 will equal the tree canopy cover for the tree, in square feet. 
                  2.  To measure the canopy cover of a group of trees or all trees on a lot. First map the projection of the canopy onto the ground on a plat or aerial photograph of the property. Measure and map the extent of the canopy in relation to the house and property lines by recording the distances from the property lines, buildings, and other structures. Calculate the square foot area by sectioning the canopy off into squares, rectangles, triangles or circles. Multiply the length by the width of the sections if they are a square or rectangle, multiply length by width and divide by two for a triangle, and use the formula for the area of a circle if more or less circular. Add the various sections together to calculate the total tree canopy cover in square feet. Once the total amount of tree canopy cover on a property has been measured, divide that total by the total area of the lot in square feet to calculate the percent canopy cover for the lot. 
                  Formula: Average canopy diameter x 3.14 = total square foot of canopy/by total lot square footage = canopy coverage percentage of lot. 
                  3.  Arborists may also use an appropriately sized dot grid that can be placed over the top of an aerial photograph or map of a property to determine total tree canopy cover percent for a lot. All dots that fall on top of tree crowns are counted and divided by the total number of dots that cover the entire lot to arrive at an estimate of tree canopy cover percent or other methodologies approved by the city arborist. 
                  4.  The minimum required inches or canopy coverage shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formulas as shown above and shall be presented in a prominent location on the tree protection and replacement plan. 
                  c.  The calculation of the inches or canopy required for residential properties shall be based on the net site area, excluding any detention ponds, lakes, stream buffers, floodplain areas and permanent easements where planting is prohibited. On single family property where there is at least 2,500 but less than 4,500 square feet of front yard area (the area of land immediately adjacent to the improvement running to the boundary of the street right of way), there shall be at least one 2.5-inch caliper tree within the front yard area. On single family residential property where there is at least 4,500 square feet of front yard area, there shall be at least two 2.5-inch caliper trees within the front yard area. Nothing in this article shall be construed to allow the removal of any tree or vegetation in a required stream buffer, transitional buffer zone or state buffer zone except buffer improvements as authorized by the director. A buffer may be pruned per ANSI standards to allow "line of sight" views to and from structures and/or surface water with the approval of the city arborist, provided, however, an entire trophic layer shall not be removed. 
                  d.  The calculation of the inches or canopy required for commercially or industrially zoned properties shall be based on the net site area, excluding any detention ponds, lakes, stream buffers, floodplain areas and permanent easements where planting is prohibited. Nothing in this article shall be construed to allow the removal of any tree or vegetation in a required stream buffer, zoning buffer, or state buffer zone except buffer improvements as authorized by the director. Trees within a buffer may be pruned per ANSI standards to allow "line of sight" views to and from structures and/or surface water with the approval of the city arborist; provided, however, an entire trophic layer shall not be removed. 
                  e.  Tree relocation of existing trees between two-inch caliper and 7.9-inch caliper inches may be used for credit on the tree replacement plan with the written approval of the city arborist. 
                  f.  Tree preservation areas shall leave intact the naturally occurring groundcover or understory vegetation unless otherwise approved in writing by the city arborist in order to remove invasive or undesirable vegetation. 
                  (5)  Issuance of permit. No permit shall be issued until the tree protection and replacement plan has been reviewed and approved by the city arborist. All tree protection measures shall be installed as approved and inspected by the city arborist or a designee prior to land disturbance. Once land disturbance begins, sites not complying with the approved tree protection and replacement plan may be issued a "Stop Work Order" or a permit may be revoked if conditions of the permit terms are violated. 
                  (6)  Final inspection. No certificate of occupancy will be issued by the director for any improvement where the construction and/or land disturbance is subject to this article until the city arborist has inspected the site and confirmed that all remaining existing trees are in good condition and all replacement trees have been planted in compliance with the approved tree protection and replacement plan.

                  (6)  A report by a certified arborist shall be included along with the tree protection and replacement plan for all specimen sized trees noting their location, size and condition. Trees meeting the specimen criteria that are slated for removal shall be recompensed at 1.5 x DBH inches with a combination of two-inch, three-inch and four-inch or larger caliper overstory tree. For trees not meeting the specimen tree criteria, the arborist report will contain supporting photo documentation and detailed descriptions supporting this determination. Upon confirmation by the city arborist, the applicant will not be required to recompense properly documented trees that do not meet the specimen tree criteria. The arborist report shall be submitted in digital format (pdf) for documentation purposes. Specimen recompense is in addition to the density factor requirement of 120 DBH inches or 45 percent canopy coverage per acre. Trees other than specimen trees saved without any critical root zone impact in excess of the required density factor of 120 DBH inches per acre or 45 percent canopy coverage may count toward the specimen recompense on a 1.5 x DBH inch basis. 
                  (7)  No specimen tree existing on a tract of land that is not to be removed pursuant to approved tree protection plan shall be removed without the written approval of the city arborist and the director. 
                  (8)  If the city arborist agrees that the specimen recompense trees will not fit on the site in accordance with accepted industry spacing requirements, alternative compliance shall be made by payment of a recompense fee to the tree fund.

                  (1)  Trees identified to be preserved and counted toward the tree density requirements shall have temporary chain link fence or four foot orange tree protection fencing and staked hay bales installed at or beyond the critical root zone. A sign shall be place on the fencing stating "Keep Out." A two-inch layer of mulch and mycorrhizae fungi shall be applied over the critical root zone prior to construction. 
                  (2)  Pre-construction limb pruning shall be performed on any trees within the construction zone, that are to be preserved, tree branches shall be pruned to an appropriate height to avoid damage by construction equipment and structures. All dead branches greater than one inch in diameter should be removed to reduce the risk of dead branch failure to construction personnel. All tree pruning is to be done using ANSI standard A300 (part 1) for pruning. No gaff or spike climbing to be used to access limbs. 
                  (3)  Root pruning is to be done whenever roots of trees are exposed during construction, All root pruning to be done using ANSI standard A300 (part 8) for root management. The root ends are to be cut off cleanly and the roots covered by dirt or plastic for as long as the root is exposed. When performing a trench excavation, the roots have to be cut on the tree-side of the trench prior to excavating. No root pruning shall be allowed in the structural root plate of any saved tree. 
                  (4)  In tree save areas where large equipment will be operating, a temporary bridge over the root system of the tree shall be constructed including but not limited to construction mats or landscape timbers and plywood. Area of bridge will typically adhere to the area under the dripline for all trees. Temporary bridge detail must be included on the tree protection and replacement plan.

                  a.  The permittee shall provide a boundary tree agreement between the homeowner and the applicant. The boundary tree owner may request for a tree escrow account to be established, which may be an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the city from the permittee in the amount agreed to by both parties or may be a cash deposit in trust with the city in that amount, or the permittee must submit an agreement contract concerning the proposed boundary tree disturbance that is agreed upon and signed and notarized by both parties, prior to permit issuance. A copy of that agreement shall be submitted to the city to be placed in the building permit file. 
                  b.  For any boundary tree that has its critical root zone impacted and/or encroached into more than 20 percent without a previously approved certified arborist prescription, the permittee shall either deposit into an escrow account, or cause to be issued in favor of the city, an irrevocable letter of credit, in an amount totaling the estimated cost of removal of the boundary tree plus the cost to replace the boundary tree with a minimum three-inch caliper tree. The applicant must send a certified letter describing the proposed disturbance to the boundary tree owner at the last known address of the boundary tree owner. A copy of the letter and the certificate of mailing must be provided to the city to place in the permit file prior to permit issuance. This does not prevent the boundary tree owner from filing a civil action in court for any damages to the boundary tree real or perceived. 
                  c.  Replacement trees shall be of comparable mature canopy size and species quality to the replaced boundary tree, and shall be ecologically compatible with the intended growing site as determined by the city arborist. 
                  d.  After three years from the date of certificate of occupancy issuance, the permittee may petition the city arborist to return the money held in escrow for the boundary tree. The city arborist will review the boundary tree to determine if it is in irreversible decline as a result of the permittee's disturbance activities. Permittee and boundary tree owner are notified of the arborist's determination via first class mail. Either party may appeal the decision to the zoning board of appeals. 
                  e.  If, during the three-year period, the boundary tree is in irreversible decline or has died as a result of the permittee's land disturbance and/or construction activity, the boundary tree owner will be issued a check by the city for the amount deposited by the permittee. The permittee and boundary tree owner will be notified by the arborist via first class mail. Either party may appeal the decision to the zoning board of appeals. 
                  f.  Neither the boundary tree owner nor the permittee shall be entitled to receive interest on any funds required by this provision. Any funds not collected by either the boundary tree owner or the permittee within a period of four years shall be deposited into the city tree fund. 
                  (d)  Removal of trees from floodplain. Trees shall not be cut or removed from the 100-year floodplain except as follows and only with prior written approval by the director:

The final light pole locations shall be depicted on the plan with a 20-foot dashed radius circle around each light pole. 
                  (g)  Street trees. 
                  (1)  On commercial and industrial sites, there shall be a minimum of one 2.5-inch caliper deciduous shade tree for every 35 feet of public street or private entrance road frontage. The planting area must be a minimum of eight feet from the back of curb, if no sidewalk is present. If a sidewalk is present or is to be installed, the planting area from the back of sidewalk must be a minimum of five feet. If the public street has a speed limit of 45 or more miles per hour, trees must be located a minimum of 16 feet from edge of the pavement. The plan submittals require a detail of the street front planting requirement and include all calculations. Root barriers may be required on a case by case basis. Acceptable understory species, as approved by utility provider, may be substituted as road frontage trees in situations where overhead power lines are present. 
                  (2)  For subdivisions, providing a design appropriate street tree planting program is an acceptable method of achieving tree density requirements. Plans will be approved on a case by case basis and trees must be a minimum of two-inch caliper. 
                  (h)  Buffers. 
                  (1)  During authorized land-disturbing activities, all buffers shall be clearly demarcated on all development plans and protected during construction in accordance with best management practices or as required by the city arborist. 
                  (2)  Required stream buffers shall comply with all current state and local guidelines. 
                  (3)  A zoning buffer shall consist of evergreen plant materials that when planted are intended to form an 80 percent visual barrier within two years and a 100 percent visual barrier within five years. Planted trees and shrubs must have a minimum height of six feet and two feet, respectively. Buffers may be required as a condition of rezoning of a parcel, the granting of a variance or the granting of a special exception under chapter 27. 
                  (4)  Disturbance or encroachments of buffers are not permitted. This includes, but is not limited to, ditches, swales, stormwater conveyance facilities, stormwater detention ponds, sanitary sewer conveyance facilities and any associated easements except that necessary utility access and crossings may encroach into the buffer as near to perpendicular as practical. 
                  (5)  Buffer planting standards are as follows: 
                  a.  Existing buffer to remain undisturbed . Sparsely vegetated or previously disturbed portions of any existing buffer shall be replanted to comply with subsection (h)(3) of this section. Dying, diseased, dead or invasive materials may be removed from a buffer provided that minimal disturbance occurs and the written approval of the city arborist or director is obtained prior to the removal. 
                  b.  Buffer width 20 feet or less . This buffer shall consist of a minimum of one row of evergreen trees and one row of evergreen shrubs. 
                  c.  Buffer width 21—35 feet . This buffer shall consist of a minimum of two rows of evergreen trees and one row of evergreen shrubs. 
                  d.  Buffer width greater than 35 feet. This buffer shall be subject to approval by the city. A mix of hardwood and evergreen trees planted within buffer areas may be counted for credit toward the minimum required density inches per acre. Up to 25 percent of this buffer may also be planted with shrubs as approved by the city arborist. 
                  (i)  Alternative compliance. The city arborist must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. For the request to be considered, the applicant must preserve trees outside of the site's buildable area having a density factor of not less than 60 DBH inches per acre with the disturbance of no more than 20 percent of the critical root zone of each tree to be preserved. Where the city arborist has determined that special constraints of a site result in an inability to provide the required 120 inches per acre or 45 percent canopy coverage and/or specimen recompense inches per acre, the number of trees will be determined by the city arborist based on site review. Possible alternatives may include one or more of the following: 
                  (1)  Common area planting within the existing development. 
                  (2)  Tree banking. Allowable in areas designated for public planting programs within a reasonable distance from the existing development. To be approved on a case by case basis by both the director and the city arborist. 
                  (3)  Tree fund. Price per inch based on current market installed costs. 
                  (j)  Tree harvesting. Permits authorizing selective tree harvesting shall be determined on a case by case basis with the approval of the city arborist and the director.

                  (1)  All tree trimming and pruning are to be performed by public utilities, public agencies and their subcontractors on trees growing on private or public rights-of-way shall be done according to the most current ANSI standards for pruning of mature trees. 
                  (2)  The routing of public and private utility easements shall be subject to review and comment by the city arborist. 
                  (3)  No person, firm or corporation shall interfere with the director of public works or persons acting under the director of public work's authority while engaged in planting, mulching, pruning or removal of trees, shrubs, etc., in any street or public place within the city. 
                  (l)  Enforcement. It shall be the duty of the director or a designee of the director to enforce this article. The director shall have the authority to, and the city arborist may recommend that, the director revoke, suspend or void any permit or suspend all work on a site or portion thereof in order to effect compliance with this section. 
                  (1)  Violation and penalty . Any violation of any of the provisions of this article by any person, firm or corporation shall be deemed an offense and upon conviction in municipal court such person, firm or corporation shall be subject to penalty as is provided in section 1-11. Each tree removed or killed in violation of this section shall be considered a separate offense. Upon conviction in municipal court, the owner of any buildings or premises or parts thereof, where anything in violation of this section exists, and any architect, builder, contractor or any other agent of the owner, or any tenant, who commits or assists in the commission of any violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense. Any homeowner of record found in violation of any of the provisions of this article, after having first been issued a warning notice, shall be subject to penalty as is provided in section 1-11. 
                  (2)  Additional legal remedies . In addition to all other actions and penalties authorized in this section, city attorney or his designee is hereby authorized to institute injunctive, abatement or any other appropriate judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to prevent, enjoin, abate or remove any violation of this section. 
                  (3)  Administrative variances . Front, side, and rear yard setbacks, and parking requirements may be reduced up to 25 percent by the city arborist and the director in order to preserve existing specimen trees. Appropriate conditions to said administrative variances shall be imposed so as to ensure the continued health of said trees following the granting of such variances, including mandatory replacement requirements. Administrative variances shall be considered and decided consistent with procedures and criteria as set forth within the zoning ordinance. 
                  (m)  Special exceptions . The zoning board of appeals shall hear and decide applications for special exceptions for the removal of a specimen tree. The provisions of sections 27-1658 through 27-1661 and sections 27-1668 through 27-1670 shall apply with regard to this section. No such special exception for the removal of a specimen tree shall be granted by the zoning board of appeals unless the applicant has demonstrated, and the zoning board of appeals has found, that the property is not capable of earning a reasonable economic return absent the grant of the special exception. In making this determination, the zoning board of appeals shall consider the following factors: 
                  (1)  Value of the trees in question, considering their age, size, health and significance. 
                  (2)  The current level of economic return on the property. 
                  (3)  The marketability of the property.

                  Sec. 14-78. - Joint and cooperative action required. 
                  (a)  The city council believes the city's stream systems are a valuable natural resource that requires joint and cooperative action by the city and the development industry to resolve existing stormwater management and flooding problems, prevention of their worsening or recurrence while utilizing this resource for the good of the entire city. 
                  (b)  The development industry and the city shall cooperate to control water quality and maintain the city's drainage and stream systems from stormwater runoff resulting from development activities. 
                  (Ord. No. 2014-12-05, § 2(14-40), 12-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 14-79. - Standards. 
                  (a)  The city shall require all land development to comply with the criteria, technical specifications, and standards of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, as may be hereafter amended. The rainfall intensities used in hydrologic and hydraulic computations shall be those published in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (b)  Applicability. A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all development and construction for the entire site which meets one or more of the following criteria: 
                  (1)  Increases the peak rate of runoff from the site by more than one cubic foot per second for a ten-year frequency storm; 
                  (2)  Involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
                  (3)  Includes the creation, addition or replacement in redevelopment of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
                  (4)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that meets the definition of a stormwater hotspot; or 
                  (5)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in subsection (b)1 and 2 of this section if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  (6)  Land development activities within individual single family lots that are not part of a larger common plan of development that also includes stormwater management facilities for the larger common plan of development, and that involve the creation, addition, or replacement of at least 3,000 square feet of impervious cover, shall provide storage and controlled release of runoff volume equivalent to the "water quality volume" for the site as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (c)  Exemptions. The provisions of this article shall not apply to the following criteria: 
                  (1)  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project unless they meet one of the criteria listed in subsection (b) of this section; 
                  (2)  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures unless it meets one of the criteria listed in subsection (b) of this section; 
                  (3)  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; 
                  (4)  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the community development director; 
                  (5)  The community development director may exempt the owner from those provisions of this article where complete compliance with those specific provisions is physically impossible; 
                  (6)  If the installation of a stormwater management facility would reduce downstream flood peaks by less than one percent; 
                  (7)  The requirements, or portions thereof, of subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall not be waived if the community development director determines that such waiver would increase known flooding problems, or exceed the capacity of the downstream drainage system; 
                  (8)  A waiver of these minimum runoff quantity control requirements may be granted only after a written request is submitted by the applicant containing descriptions, drawings, and any other information that is necessary to evaluate the proposed land disturbing activity. A separate written waiver request shall be required if there are subsequent additions, extensions, or modifications, to the development which would alter the approved stormwater runoff characteristics of a land disturbing activity receiving a waiver; and 
                  (9)  Appeals from the waiver decisions may be taken to the zoning board of appeals pursuant to the provisions of section 14-26(c). 
                  (d)  If 40 percent of a site is to be redeveloped, all stormwater requirements must be met for the redeveloped area only and the non-disturbed area will be treated as predeveloped prior to the redevelopment. But if more than 40 percent of the site is to be redeveloped, then the entire site must meet all stormwater requirements. 
                  (e)  A downstream peak flow analysis will include the assumptions, results and supporting calculations to show safe passage of post-development design flows downstream. The analysis of downstream conditions in the report shall address each and every point or area along the project site's boundaries at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion of the drainage channel or watercourse immediately downstream from the project. This area shall extend downstream from the project to a point in the drainage basin where the project area is ten percent of the total basin area. In calculating runoff volumes and discharge rates, consideration may need to be given to any planned future upstream land use changes. The analysis shall be in accordance with the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (f)  Detention designs may be rejected by the community development director if they incorporate structures and facilities that will demand considerable maintenance or will be difficult to maintain or will utilize numerous small structures if other alternatives are physically possible. 
                  (g)  Discharge velocities from detention facilities shall be reduced to provide a non-erosive velocity flow from a structure, channel, or other control measure as set forth in the approved state stormwater management manual. 
                  (h)  Stormwater management and flood control facilities may include both structural and nonstructural components. Natural or planted vegetation as well as other natural runoff conduits are examples of these non-structural components and shall be retained where practicable. In addition, these components must provide for or enhance stormwater quantity or quality control or other stormwater benefits. 
                  (i)  The drainage system being developed shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a 100-year storm event. 
                  (j)  The drainage system from a proposed development must discharge into an outfall that has adequate capacity to accommodate the runoff from the development. If the connecting downstream system is not able to accommodate the allowable design flows from the site, then the design engineer must design drainage facilities with the capacity to over-detain flows so they can be accommodated by the existing downstream conveyance structures whereby allowing the existing downstream system to operate correctly. If downstream easements are needed to extend the drainage system to an adequate outfall, the developer shall obtain these easements. 
                  (k)  A landscaping plan shall be submitted for all detention and other storage facilities as part of the overall drainage plan. 
                  (l)  Land uses within the intermediate regional floodplain shall not diminish or restrict the capacity of the channels or floodplains of the stream, its tributaries, drainage ditches or any other stormwater management facilities or systems and shall not increase the IRF elevation or velocity or concentration of flow in downstream areas. The development permit shall be denied if the required hydrologic studies reveal that a request for filling or grading within the intermediate regional floodplain would overload the capacity of the channel downstream or increase flood stages upstream, unless equivalent flow and storage capacity is replaced and maintained by the owner within the intermediate regional floodplain. Altered sections of the intermediate regional floodplain shall have a positive slope so as to provide positive drainage back to the stream flow line and this section must be maintained by the owners in perpetuity so as to prevent or remove silt buildup. 
                  (m)  Excavation within floodplain areas shall not be permitted unless the excavation can be accomplished in such a manner that the existing low level drainage pattern through the floodplain shall be maintained. The area of compensation within the floodplain shall be considered as ineffective flow area for the purpose of calculating floodplain elevations to meet no-rise certification requirements. The amount of compensation shall be limited to 300 cubic yards per acre of floodplain area. 
                  (n)  The live detention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of the 100-year frequency rainfall as published in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. The detention system required shall be necessary to handle the runoff of a 100-year rainfall, for any and all durations from the post-development, with a release rate that does not exceed the pre-development release rate during the same duration storm. Detention control structures and other drainage improvements shall be located and designed to prevent erosion damage to adjacent property owners. 
                  (o)  When the applicant requests and the community development director determines that development and construction projects are too small, or that engineering and economic factors make combined detention or other stormwater management facilities more practical, the city may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two or more properties by two or more applicants. This authorization shall be granted by the zoning board of appeals upon application for approval being submitted through the community development director. Where joint detention facilities serving two or more properties are approved for construction, no use of land or occupancy of buildings within the properties served by these facilities shall be permitted until completion of the detention facility, except upon approval of the zoning board of appeals.

                  Sec. 14-80. - Installation, development and maintenance of control facilities. 
                  The following requirements shall apply to the installation, development and maintenance of all stormwater and sedimentation control facilities designed for temporary storage of stormwater runoff: 
                  (1)  Permanent fencing at least four feet in height shall be required around all facilities having a temporary water storage depth of greater than four feet or those designated by the board of health as constituting a public health hazard. 
                  (2)  This fencing shall be designed, installed and maintained to allow the free flow of runoff and sediment into the facility. Fencing shall be established on the outside edge of a facility. The fence shall include a gate of sufficient size to permit entrance of equipment necessary to allow periodic maintenance activities. The gate shall be placed in a manner such that the gate does not obstruct reasonable access or become obstructive. The community development director may waive fencing in nonresidential areas where a pond is more than 500 feet from a residential district and in residential districts when detention is provided in natural areas such as stream channels and fencing in the opinion of the community development director would damage the environment or affect stream flow. 
                  (3)  The access easement to the facility shall not have a profile slope steeper than 33 percent and a cross slope of no more than ten percent. The elevation of the maintenance easement around the facility shall be established at the top of the dam or wall elevation and be constructed with a cross slope of no more than ten percent to the drainage facility. Fencing that complies with the requirement of subsection (2) of this section shall be constructed on the outside edge of the maintenance easement. Gates that comply with the requirements of subsection (p)2 of this section shall be constructed on each maintenance easement. 
                  (4)  Detention and sedimentation control facilities shall not be placed in any of the following: 
                  a.  Transitional buffer zones as defined by chapter 27. 
                  b.  Floodplains. 
                  c.  Wetlands. 
                  d.  Stream buffer zones. 
                  e.  State buffer zones. 
                  (5)  Perforated standpipes or a French drain, in accordance with published design standards available from the community development director, or other methods which will achieve equal performance to prevent standing water and inadequate drainage shall be installed within all the detention and sedimentation control facilities. 
                  (6)  The commercial or multifamily residential property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the stormwater management facilities during grading, construction, and following final approval of the completed project. This maintenance and certification obligation shall be binding on all future owners, successors and assigns of the property. 
                  (7)  In the case of single-family residential subdivisions approved after the date of adoption of this provision, and in accordance with the requirements of article III of this chapter, the city shall assume maintenance responsibility one year after the release of the performance bond for subdivision streets. A special drainage district as authorized by the Georgia Constitution, article IX, section II, paragraph VI is established for property in a single-family residential subdivision at the time the plat is finally recorded, and will be so noted on the plat. Upon completion of developer maintenance, all detention ponds shall have a positive slope to the outlet in order to facilitate complete drainage. 
                  (8)  Stormwater management facilities in single-family residential subdivisions constructed under permits issued prior to the amendment of the city ordinance assigning maintenance responsibility will not be accepted for city maintenance unless individually approved by and at the discretion of the community development department and suitable access easements are provided. At the time the community development director accepts a detention facility for city maintenance, a special drainage district will be established that includes all properties for which the detention facility is designed to compensate for increased peak runoff rates due to development.

                  (1)  Pursuant to chapter 25, article VI, as amended, trash, garbage, construction materials, construction by-products or other debris shall not be deposited in any part of the drainage system. 
                  (2)  No restriction or barriers, including fences, may be placed in the drainage system or intermediate regional floodplain without first obtaining a development permit. When on-site or off-site debris has accumulated within an intermediate regional floodplain in such a manner as to interfere with the free flow of water so as to increase the risk of hazardous inundation of upstream properties adjacent to the intermediate regional floodplain, the community development director shall require the owner of the property where this debris was generated, if its source can be identified, to clear and remove the debris so as to permit the free flow of water. 
                  (3)  No impoundment of water which retains in excess of 0.5 acre (in feet) of runoff shall be removed without first obtaining a development permit, which shall only be issued after competent engineering studies provided by the applicant show that this removal will not adversely affect downstream properties. 
                  (4)  No permanent structures or additions shall be constructed within the intermediate regional floodplain other than those non-building facilities required or authorized by the community development director which will not conflict with the hydrologic design characteristics of the approved development and construction plans. Land within the intermediate regional floodplain may be used to meet setback, yard, open space and buffer requirements in accordance with applicable provisions of chapter 27 and the buffer requirements of this chapter.

                  (1)  Water quality BMPs must be installed on all developments to improve the water quality of the storm runoff from the development site. Stormwater management systems (which can include both structural stormwater controls and better site design practices) must be designed to remove 80 percent of the average annual post-development total suspended solids load. As a minimum, the runoff from the first 1.2 inches of rainfall must be treated. Acceptable BMPs for treating stormwater runoff are set forth in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (2)  BMPs shall be used to control discharges into the local drainage system of any organic or inorganic matter that cause or tend to cause pollution of such waters. 
                  a.  Minimization of impervious areas within developments and minimization of impervious areas directly connected to the local drainage system is encouraged as a non-structural BMP for water quality and quantity control. 
                  b.  A plan shall be provided to protect all existing wetland/floodplain areas within the development site.

                  (a)  The zoning board of appeals shall hear and decide applications for variances from the strict application of division 1 of this article VII, known as the subdivision regulations of city, where strict application of any regulation enacted in division 3 of this article VII would result in exceptional and undue hardship to the owner of such property. These regulations provide the minimum necessary requirements for subdivisions in city; thus, variances from the requirements of division 3 of this article VII shall be authorized only upon making all of the following findings: 
                  (1)  By reason of the shape or topographical conditions of a parcel of property which were not created by the owner or applicant, the strict application of division 3 of this article VII would deprive the property owner of rights and privileges enjoyed by other similarly situated property owners in the same zoning district; 
                  (2)  By reason of the shape or topographical conditions of a parcel of property which were not created by the owner or applicant, there is no opportunity for development under any design configuration allowed by these subdivision regulations unless a variance is granted; 
                  (3)  The requested variance does not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief, and does not constitute the grant of a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other property owners in the zoning district in which the subject property is located; 
                  (4)  The requested variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the zoning district in which the subject property is located; and 
                  (5)  The requested variance will not in any manner vary the provisions of chapter 27 or the official zoning map of the city. 
                  (b)  No variance shall be granted to: 
                  (1)  Allow any variance which conflicts with or changes any requirement enacted as a condition of zoning or of a special land use permit by the city council; 
                  (2)  Increase the density allowed on the property; or 
                  (3)  Vary the requirements set forth in sections 14-454 through 14-458. 
                  (c)  Applications for a variance may be submitted to the community development director, or his designee. At a minimum, the variance application must contain a full explanation of the reasons for the variance and must include a plat that shows the proposed subdivision designed without the variance and a plat that shows the proposed subdivision designed with the variance. 
                  (d)  Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, the applications for variances for the preliminary plat shall be heard pursuant to article V, division 5 of chapter 27. All land development activity associated with a proposed variance from a preliminary plat shall cease until a final decision on the variance is made by the zoning board of appeals. 
                  (e)  The zoning board of appeals shall issue a final decision on a variance from the preliminary plat within 60 days after the first public hearing on the variance. If a final decision is not made on a subdivision plat variance in accordance with the time constraints set forth in this section, the variance shall stand disapproved. 
                  (f)  Appeals of variances shall be made by writ of certiorari to the superior court of the county. Any person or entity aggrieved by a variance decision may appeal such decision by filing a petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court of the county. A person shall be considered aggrieved for purposes of this subsection only if: 
                  (1)  Said person or the person's property was the subject of the action appealed from; or 
                  (2)  Said person has a substantial interest in the action appealed from that is in danger of suffering special damage or injury not common to all property owners similarly situated.

                  (b)  Violations and penalties. Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of these regulations shall be deemed guilty of an offense and upon conviction in municipal court shall be punished as is provided in section 1-11.

The owner of any structures, buildings, lots or parcels or parts thereof, where anything in violation of these regulations exists, and any architect, builder, contractor or any other agent of the owner, or any tenant, who commits or assists in the commission of any violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense. 
                  (c)  Enforcement . Appropriate actions and proceedings, including the issuance of stop work orders and actions in a court of law, may be taken by city in law or in equity to prevent any violation of these regulations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages, to restrain, correct, or abate a violation and to prevent illegal occupancy of a building structure or premises.

                  Sec. 14-266. - Appeals. 
                  The decision of the community development department or the director's designee to approve or disapprove the final plat may be appealed by an aggrieved person or entity to the city council, on the form prescribed by the community development department. The city council shall hold a hearing on the appeal, and shall issue a decision on the appeal within 60 days of the first hearing on the appeal. The decision of the community development department or the director's designee shall only be reversed upon a finding that the decision was arbitrary or based on an erroneous interpretation of a material fact or section of this chapter. Any aggrieved person from the decision of the city council may appeal by writ of certiorari to the superior court of the county. A person shall be considered aggrieved for purposes of this section only if: 
                  (1)  Said person or the person's property was the subject of the action appealed from; or 
                  (2)  Said person has a substantial interest in the action appealed from that is in danger of suffering special damage or injury not common to all property owners similarly situated.

                  (a)  When it becomes necessary to revise an original recorded final plat due to some error, required adjustment or desired adjustment, the applicant shall confer with the community development director. The applicant's surveyor shall make the necessary corrections on the original final plat or prepare a new tracing of that portion of the subdivision involved. The subdivision name, date and book and page number of the original recording shall be noted on the new plat. If the original final plat is not available, then any proposed revision to the final plat shall be considered a major change. 
                  (b)  A minor change is one that corrects a drafting or scrivener's error or is otherwise administrative in nature and does not affect how the subdivision will be developed or built. A major change is any other change, including changes that alter how the subdivision will be developed or built, such as, but not limited to, changing or moving lot lines, increasing or decreasing the number of lots, changing the location of any public facilities or utilities, and revising protective covenants applying to the property. 
                  (c)  If the community development director determines the change is minor, then the community development director approve the revised final plat, and shall file such revised plat with the clerk of superior court. 
                  (d)  If the community development director determines the change is major, the revised plat must proceed through the approval process for final plats described in this Code.

                  (b)  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all subdivision streets shall conform to the provisions of this chapter and to the thoroughfare plan. The thoroughfare plan means the thoroughfare plan adopted by the county, as amended. New streets shall be designed and located with consideration of their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by the streets.

                  Where a subdivision borders on or contains an arterial street (major thoroughfares, and minor thoroughfares), a railroad right-of-way or limited-access highway right-of-way, the community development director or designee may require the following: 
                  (1)  Rear service alleys to facilitate traffic flow, safety and public services; 
                  (2)  Provision of one or a pair of smaller marginal access streets approximately parallel to and on each side of this right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land as park or open space and to provide for multipurpose trails. These distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations; or 
                  (3)  In the case of limited-access highways only, reverse frontage lots may be created with landscape buffers and a non-access reserve strip along the rear property line.

                  (a)  Each building shall be located on a lot or parcel that abuts a public street or private street. Private streets shall only be allowed if the development seeking to have a private streets is ten acres or larger in size. The community development department shall have the authority to waive this minimum acreage requirement if all real property owners that abut the proposed private street agree to such waiver. 
                  (b)  Where this chapter measures minimum building setback lines and frontages, or imposes development standards in connection with, or with reference to public streets, such measurements or standards set forth in the district regulations and supplemental regulations of chapter 27, in this chapter or elsewhere in this Code shall apply similarly for property abutting a private street. Nothing in this article is intended to authorize any kind of development on a private street that would not be authorized where there was public right-of-way. 
                  (c)  Private streets within any zoning district shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements of this Code. Private streets within any district shall be assigned names and locations. The names of these streets shall be shown on plans required for the issuance of building and development permits as provided in this chapter and chapters 7 and 27. The geographical information services department shall approve all private street names and addresses, thereby avoiding conflicting names and addresses. 
                  (d)  Lots may front on a public street or private street constructed to the standards found in this chapter. 
                  (e)  Where sewer lines are constructed underneath a private street, the developer is required to grant an easement to the county or city for installation, maintenance and repair of such sewer lines. 
                  (f)  Private streets shall not be eligible for participation in the city's traffic calming program as provided for in chapter 17.

                  (h)  Developers and property owners' associations shall ensure access to all private streets by emergency and law enforcement vehicles and shall ensure that private streets are constructed to allow access by all emergency vehicles and law enforcement vehicles. 
                  (i)  The use of private streets may not result in an increase in permitted density above that which would otherwise be permitted by the applicable district regulations. Density calculations shall be made based on a public street system and the preliminary plat that provides for a private street shall be density neutral. Additionally, a utility easement is not to be included in any plat as a part of an individual lot and thus such land that comprises the utility easements cannot be used to calculate the required minimum lot size, or minimum front yard size. 
                  (j)  Private streets shall comply with requirements for public streets found in this chapter and all other applicable sections of this Code. Private streets shall be surfaced with the same type of materials that are used by the city's department of public works for the surfacing and resurfacing of public streets or with materials that are as protective as those used by the city to surface and resurface streets so long as such alternative materials are approved by the director of public works.

                  (a)  The community development department may authorize a private street when the applicant has submitted all required documentation as set forth herein and where the community development department finds that: 
                  (1)  The location of the proposed private streets will not adversely impact use of any existing surrounding public streets; 
                  (2)  The location of the proposed private street will not adversely impact adjacent existing communities or neighborhoods; 
                  (3)  The applicant has shown that there is the requisite legal mechanism for the maintenance of the proposed private streets; and 
                  (4)  The applicant has provided written evidence that the proposed private street system is acceptable to the city and county departments or divisions responsible for law enforcement, sanitation, transportation and fire and rescue. 
                  (b)  Street rights-of-way shall be owned by the mandatory homeowners' association as required by section 14-350. Street rights-of-way shall comply with all the requirements set forth in this Code, including, but not limited to, the requirements set forth in this chapter and in chapter 27. An access easement and a utility easement shall entirely overlay the rights-of-way and shall be dedicated to city for public use. All applicable setbacks, lot widths and lot areas shall be measured from the homeowner's association right-of-way.

                  (a)  Maintenance of private streets. 
                  (1)  Each developer that chooses to include private streets within a condominium, as that term is defined by state law, or any other residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial or office development shall organize and establish a property owners' association prior to recording of the final plat. Membership in the property owners' association shall be mandatory for each original and successive purchaser of a lot, building or unit within the development. The property owners' association shall be organized so that it has clear legal authority to maintain and exercise control over the private streets and required improvements associated with private streets, including, but not limited to, sidewalks, bikeways, curbs and gutters, traffic signs and markings, associated landscaping and lighting, entry signs, monuments, perimeter walls and fences, entry gates and gatehouses. The declaration of covenants creating the property owners' association shall be recorded with the clerk of the superior court of the county and the recorded declaration of covenants and articles of incorporation creating the property owners' association shall provide that all private streets and associated improvements are owned by the property owners' association or are held in common by the property owners within the development. Said streets shall be properly maintained and insured with no liability or maintenance responsibilities accruing to the city. The recorded declaration of covenants and articles of association shall specifically require the property owners' association to repair and maintain each private street in the same manner as similar public streets are maintained by the city and such maintenance and repair shall be performed in compliance with all city standards and all applicable provisions of law. 
                  (2)  Prior to any final plat approval, the developer shall submit articles of incorporation, declaration of covenants and bylaws for the property owners' association to the community development department. Those documents must thereafter be reviewed and approved by the city attorney. 
                  (b)  Maintenance fund. The declaration of covenants and articles of association shall provide for a street maintenance fund the proceeds of which shall be used solely for the purpose of regular maintenance of the streets, whether for resurfacing or a similar purpose. For the purposes of further providing further assurance that city funds shall not be used for maintenance of private streets, the developer shall submit proof of deposit of 50 percent of the current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by community development director or designee, in an interest bearing account on behalf of the property owners' association. 
                  (c)  Maintenance bond. At the end of the 12-month maintenance period provided for in section 14-675, a developer must provide a maintenance bond renewable annually to cover the cost of maintenance and repair for any private streets within a subdivision. The bond shall be for an amount equal to 50 percent of the current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the community development director or designee. The developer may avoid securing the maintenance bond set forth in this subsection if the developer submits proof to the community development department that 100 percent of the then-current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the community development director or designee, has been deposited in an interest-bearing account on behalf of the property owners' association. If the developer chooses this alternative, the declarations of covenants and articles of association shall specifically require the property owners' association to continuously maintain 100 percent of the then-current estimate of resurfacing costs of the private streets in this maintenance fund. 
                  (d)  Assessment and liens. The property owners' association must be empowered to levy assessments against owners within the development for the payment of expenditures made by the association for maintenance of the private streets and other items set forth in subsection (a) of this section. At least 15 percent of all fees or assessments paid shall be set aside in the maintenance fund. Any unpaid assessments shall constitute a lien in favor of the property owners' association on the lot, building or unit of the owner.

                  (a)  Within nine months following approval of the final plat, the city's community development director or designee shall inspect the private streets to ensure compliance with all city standards and all applicable provisions of this Code including, but not limited to, the requirements set forth in law for public streets, curbs, sidewalks, signage and street lighting. The developer shall be notified of any deficiencies in writing and such deficiencies shall be corrected within 60 days of the written notice of deficiencies unless the city agrees to extension of that period in writing. 
                  (b)  Failure to correct the complete list of deficiencies shall be a violation of this section and shall subject the developer to prosecution for a code violation in the municipal court of city. Any person found to have violated this section shall be subject to a fine of not less than $500.00 for each violation. A separate and distinct offense shall be regarded as committed each day on which such person shall continue any such violation. 
                  (c)  The community development director or designee shall deny the issuance of certificates of occupancy until all deficiencies have been corrected.

The petition shall include evidence that 100 percent of all property owners in the property owners' association have agreed that the street at issue may become private and have agreed to maintain and exercise control over the private street as required by this article. 
                  (e)  The petition shall contain evidence that the property owners' association has the financial ability to maintain the street and associated improvements in perpetuity. 
                  (f)  The petition shall include evidence that the declaration of covenants and articles of association or other legal instruments creating the property owners' association provide or have been amended to provide that membership in the property owners' association shall be mandatory for each original and successive purchaser of a lot, building or unit on the street.

Said streets shall be properly maintained and insured with no liability or maintenance responsibilities accruing to the city. 
                  (i)  The petition shall include evidence that the declaration of covenants and articles of association shall provide for a maintenance fund, the proceeds of which shall be used solely for the purpose of regular maintenance of the streets, whether for resurfacing or similar purpose. For the purposes of further providing further assurances that city funds shall not be used for maintenance of private streets, the property owners' association shall submit proof of a maintenance fund equal to 50 percent of the current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the community development director or designee, in an interest bearing account on behalf of the property owners' association. 
                  (j)  The petition shall include evidence that the property owners have a maintenance bond renewable annually in an amount equal to 50 percent of the current estimate of resurfacing costs, as determined by the community development director or designee.

                  (2)  Is supported by an analysis by public works department that shows that the street is no longer used by the public to the extent that it serves no substantial public purpose and that the public at large will benefit from its closure since the public will no longer be responsible for any costs to maintain and repair the street; and 
                  (3)  Is supported by an analysis by the community development department that shows that the abandonment of the street shall not negatively impact adjacent neighboring communities and the public at large. 
                  Deferral of a petition or failure to provide a recommendation by the community development department shall not prevent the governing authority from taking any and all appropriate action with respect to the petition identified in this section.

                  Sec. 14-354. - Improvements; right-of-way dedication. 
                  (a)  All proposed new streets shall be designed and built according to one of the standards listed in section 14-353. 
                  (b)  Where a proposed subdivision involving new development or project requiring a land development permit has frontage on an existing public street, right-of-way shall be dedicated along that frontage so as to meet the standards of that street's classification. The right-of-way shall be improved wherever required as further provided in this section. For existing streets on which a proposed subdivision involving new development or project requiring a land development permit has frontage, the applicant shall: 
                  (1)  Dedicate a minimum of 50 percent of the required right-of-way width as measured from the centerline of the existing street right-of-way; 
                  (2)  Install all required sidewalks, street trees, streetlights, and place utilities according to the standards in section 14-353; and 
                  (3)  Provide a minimum of 50 percent of the roadway pavement required in section 14-353 and install it to the right-of-way centerline. 
                  (c)  Land reserved for any road purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements on the city zoning ordinance where the land is to be dedicated to the public in fee simple or an easement associated with the road is granted to city. 
                  (d)  Right-of-way dedication and road widening shall extend for the full length of road frontage of the property under development and shall conform the standards in these regulations. Flares at pavement ends may be required to extend beyond property under development. 
                  (e)  The public works director, after considering all related factors, may authorize deviations from this section as follows: 
                  (1)  Right-of-way dedication may be waived or modified if: 
                  a.  Existing use of property is not to be substantially changed as a result of proposed development or construction; 
                  b.  Existing government construction plans for the roadway indicate lesser right-of-way would be required for dedication; or 
                  c.  The adjoining frontage is developed and the predominate existing right-of-way meets city standards. 
                  (2)  Road improvements may be waived or modified if: 
                  a.  Existing use of property not to be substantially changed (i.e., traffic generation and ingress/egress would remain the same); 
                  b.  Governmental construction plans for the road indicate a pavement width less than city standards (only the planned pavement width shall be required);

                  (2)  Right-turn lanes shall be required at all driveways where the right-turning volume exceeds 300 vehicles per day. 
                  (3)  The following driveway spacing shall be required for all driveways along the corridor between median openings or intersections with public roadways (measured center line to center line): 
                  a.  The minimum distance of an upstream driveway from a median opening or intersection with a public roadway shall be 300 feet in addition to the storage length required for the driveway. 
                  b.  The minimum distance of a downstream driveway from a median opening or intersection with a public roadway shall be 300 feet. 
                  (4)  All developments shall have access to a public right-of-way. Access to a public right-of-way may be obtained via an adjacent public roadway with a lower functional classification. The maximum number of driveways per parcel depends upon the length of frontage along the corridor: 
                  a.  For parcels with less than 600 feet of frontage, there shall be a maximum of one driveway allowed per parcel. 
                  b.  For parcels with at least 600 feet of frontage, there shall be a maximum of two driveways per parcel. 
                  c.  For parcels which have frontage along an adjacent public roadway with a lower functional classification, the maximum number of driveways will be unchanged, but the first driveway shall be located on the adjacent public roadway. 
                  (5)  All driveways serving a single parcel must be at least 100 feet (measured from the centerline) from the property line that is perpendicular to the property frontage, and all deceleration lanes must be contained entirely within the property frontage. For parcels with insufficient frontage to accommodate these requirements, exceptions will be allowed, but driveway locations must be approved by the city manager or his designee. Access to a public right-of-way may be obtained through a shared driveway, which provides access to more than one parcel. Shared driveways are exempt from the requirement regarding distance of the driveway from the property line. 
                  (6)  There shall be a minimum driveway throat length of 50 feet.

                  It is determined that: 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
                  (3)  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: 
                  a.  Protect human life and health; 
                  b.  Minimize damage to private property; 
                  c.  Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and 
                  d.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  (4)  Article IX, section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does ordain this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.

                  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

                  Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) of this section; 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data anti certification thereof; and 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the director until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the director.

                  The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this division. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the director or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein. 
                  (1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this division shall be submitted to the director. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the director. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  (2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the director shall have the right to appeal such decision to the zoning board of appeals as established by the city in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the zoning board of appeals. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  (3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board of appeals may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county by writ of certiorari, as provided in this Code and the Official Code of Georgia. 
                  (4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (7)  In reviewing such requests, the director and zoning board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this division. 
                  (8)  Conditions for variances. 
                  a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  b.  The provisions of this division are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  d.  The floodplain coordinator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the director and zoning board of appeals shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request. 
                  (10)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this division, the director and the zoning board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this division. 
                  (11)  Variances shall not be issued after the fact.

Before taking any of the following actions or imposing any of the following penalties, the director shall first notify the applicant or other responsible person in writing of its intended action, and shall provide a reasonable opportunity of not less than ten days (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24 hours' notice shall be sufficient) to cure such violation. In the event the applicant or other responsible person fails to cure such violation after such notice and cure period, the director may take any one or more of the following actions or impose any one or more of the following penalties: 
                  (1)  Stop work order. The director may issue a stop work order that shall be served on the applicant or other responsible person.

                  (3)  Suspension, revocation or modification of permit . The director may suspend, revoke or modify the permit authorizing the development project. A suspended, revoked or modified permit may be reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated (upon such conditions as the director may deem necessary) to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations. 
                  (b)  Issuance of citation; violation. For violations of this article, the director may issue a citation to the owner or other responsible person, requiring such person to appear in the appropriate court to answer charges for such violation.

However, for convenience of both the city and the taxpayer those businesses subject to the occupational tax shall on or before February 1 file with the finance department's business occupation tax section a return showing all gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year ending on December 31. This return showing preceding calendar year gross receipts shall be used as an estimate of gross receipts for making payments on the occupation tax for the current calendar year. The number of employees reported for the current year's business operations may be based upon the number of employees employed in the business conducted during the previous year.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a lawyer begins business after January 1 of the occupation tax year, the tax and administrative fee on such business shall be due and payable on December 31 of the year in which the business begins. Any lawyer failing to pay the occupation tax and administrative fee within 120 days after December 31 shall be considered delinquent and shall be subject to and shall pay a ten percent penalty of the amount of tax or fee due and interest as provided by state law. Such penalty shall be assessed in full on May 1 of the year following the tax year in addition to interest on delinquent occupational taxes and administrative fees. In addition, a list of all delinquent lawyers may be sent to the Georgia Bar. Certain general penalties applicable to most businesses for continuing violations of this Code shall not apply to violations of this chapter by lawyers.

                  (f)  For out-of-state businesses with no location in the state, occupation taxes include the gross receipts of business as defined in section 15-34.

                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects. 
                  (2)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to the secondary effects. 
                  (c)  Adoption of findings of secondary effects. The city adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

Within 30 days of the filing of a completed sexually oriented business license application, the city manager shall either issue a license to the applicant or issue a written notice of intent to deny a license to the applicant. The city manager shall issue a license unless:

                  a.  Been declared by a court of law to be a nuisance; or 
                  b.  Been subject to an order of closure. 
                  (5)  The applicant has been convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to a specified criminal activity, as defined in this article. 
                  (c)  License information. The license, if granted, shall state on its face the name of the person or persons to whom it is granted, the number of the license issued to the licensees, the expiration date, and, if the license is for a sexually oriented business, the address of the sexually oriented business. The sexually oriented business license shall be posted in a conspicuous place at or near the entrance to the sexually oriented business so that it may be read at any time that the business is occupied by patrons or is open to the public.

                  Sec. 16-1. - Purpose and findings. 
                  The governing authority of the city finds that nuisances are such activities and conditions that cause a demonstrable adverse impact on the community. These activities and conditions may be associated with illegal criminal activity that has also been proven to have a demonstrable adverse impact on community residences and results in neighborhood blight. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizens to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the city in enacting the ordinance from which this chapter is derived are as follows: 
                  (1)  To state that it is the duty of the owner of every dwelling, building, structure, or property within the jurisdiction to construct and maintain such dwelling, building, structure, or property in conformance with applicable codes in force within the jurisdiction, or such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure, or property in violation of such codes or ordinances; 
                  (2)  To preserve the value of property and prevent neighborhood blight that arises from poorly maintained property; 
                  (3)  To maintain and promote an attractive residential area and commercial area by requiring that dilapidated property be repaired or removed; 
                  (4)  To maintain for the city's residents, workers and visitors an aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interest of the city; 
                  (5)  To protect the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of city by the removal of both criminal perpetrators and the housing blight on the community; 
                  (6)  To require owners of real property to keep their property in compliance with building, safety and fire codes to minimize the occurrence of illegal criminal activity therein; 
                  (7)  To promote the safety of its citizens, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public areas, to attract tourists, settlers and industry, to serve the public health, safety and aesthetics, to advance the general prosperity of the community and to serve the general welfare; and 
                  (8)  To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

                  (f)  After notice and a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (e)(2) of this section, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of activities described in subsection (a) of this section; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order of abatement: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, the order of abatement shall require the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, shall require the taking of reasonable measures designed to prevent the recurrence of the nuisance activity described in subsection (a) of this section in light of the magnitude of the harm caused by the nuisance. Those measures may include, but are not limited to, making improvements to real estate and installing lighting to enhance security, the hiring of licensed and insured security personnel, the hiring of a receiver, the initiation and execution of eviction proceedings against tenants engaged in illegal activity.

                  (3)  The court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by county tax records, affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided by state law, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the county. 
                  (g)  The court may authorize the issuance of ex parte administrative search warrants reasonably calculated to determine whether the nuisance has been abated or whether the order of the court has been obeyed. 
                  (h)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the building official may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with illegal activities or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  After a hearing, if it is deemed by the court that this section has not been complied with, such owner or other person is given five days from written notice, to comply and if he fails or refuses to do so, the building official shall thereupon cause the work to be done. 
                  (i)  If the building official has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. 
                  (1)  The city, the building official and the city council are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; and 
                  (2)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (j)  The lien provided for in subsection (i)(2) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(g), as amended. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (k)  The city council may waive and release any lien imposed on property pursuant to subsection (i)(2) of this section if the owner of such property enters into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property; demonstrates the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation; fully completes the rehabilitation; and fulfills all terms of the contract. 
                  (l)  The city council may appropriate revenue as necessary and may accept and apply grants or donations in carrying out the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (m)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court of the county, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court of the county under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29, as may hereinafter be amended. Notice of an appeal shall act as a supersedeas.

Any individual who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of the special variance may file a statement with the chief or the chief's representative containing any information to support such individual's claim. 
                  (c)  In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the chief or the chief's designated representative shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community, and other persons of not granting the special variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impact of granting the special variance. Applicants for special variances may be required to submit any information the chief or the chief's representative may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the chief or the chief's representative shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the special variance. 
                  (d)  Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted activity. The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any condition of the special variance shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those provisions of this article regulating the source of sound or activity for which the special variance was granted. 
                  (e)  Application for extension of time limits specified in special variances or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated like applications for initial special variances. 
                  (f)  The chief of police or the chief's designated representative may issue guidelines approved by city council defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a special variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether or not to grant a special variance.

Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:

The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (e)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (f)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (g)  The lien provided for in subsection (e) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in DeKalb County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (a).

The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within 90 days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
                  (h)  It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A § 48-4-78 that requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The tax commissioner may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (i)  The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality whose ordinance is being enforced. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (j)  In addition to the remedies and powers authorized elsewhere in this chapter, the governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (k)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by writ of certiorari to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, life safety and general welfare of properties and occupiers of buildings and structures within the city in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city.

To the extent any federal or state law, regulation, or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professional(s), and contractor(s) to satisfy such legal requirements.

                  Sec. 16-301. - Purpose. 
                  The existence of real property that is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services. 
                  In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, this board of commissioners, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations at Chapter 61, Urban Redevelopment, of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread. 
                  In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

                  (3)  Following completion of the inspection report, the public officer shall make a determination, in writing, that a property is maintained in a blighted condition, as defined by this article, and is subject to increased taxation. 
                  (4)  The public officer shall cause a written notice of his determination that the real property at issue is being maintained in a blighted condition to be served upon the person(s) shown on the most recent tax digest of DeKalb County as responsible for payment of ad valorem taxes assessed thereon; provided, however, where through the existence of reasonable diligence it becomes known to the public officer that real property has been sold or conveyed since publication of the most recent tax digest, written notice shall be given to the person(s) known or reasonably believed to then own the property or be chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes thereon, at the best address available.

The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every $25,000.00 or portion thereof equaling one year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than four successive years.

                  Sec. 18-100. - Loitering for purposes of engaging in drug related activity. 
                  (a)  Legislative findings and intent. 
                  (1)  The city finds that the increase throughout the city of loitering in public places for the purposes of unlawful drug-related activity, or in effect, "open air" drug dealing, has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses. This activity has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of fear and intimidation and disorder. 
                  (2)  Loitering for purposes of unlawful drug-related activity usually includes a dominate presence of those persons engaging in such activity by approaching pedestrians, encouraging the presence of vehicle and pedestrian traffic for the purpose of unlawful drug-related activity in and out of residential areas, to or from motor vehicles or in parking lots. Such presence carries with it an implicit threat to visitors and residents to avoid the use of these public places. The avoidance of such places by law-abiding citizens leads to an increased opportunity for the unlawful criminal activity and furthers the decay of the neighborhood. 
                  (3)  The city has a strong interest in ensuring that citizens feel safe in their neighborhoods, in safeguarding the economic vitality of its business districts, and in preserving public places for their intended purposes. 
                  (4)  This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising their right to assemble or engage in any other constitutionally protected activity. This section applies to all persons with the requisite intent to induce another to engage in unlawful drug-related activity. 
                  (b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, as defined in section 18-10, in or near any thoroughfare, place open to the public, or any public or private place in order to induce, entice, solicit or procure another to engage in unlawful drug-related activity. 
                  (1)  The term "unlawful drug-related activity" means conduct which constitutes an offense defined in O.C.G.A. tit. 16, ch. 13, as amended; conduct which constitutes complicity to commit such an offense by, for example, acting as a lookout; or conduct which constitutes conspiracy to commit such an offense. 
                  (2)  The term "public place" means an area open to the public or exposed to public view and includes streets, sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles, whether moving or not, and buildings open to the general public, including those which serve food or drink, or provide entertainment, and the doorways and entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them. 
                  (c)  A police officer who observes a person loitering under circumstances that provide the officer with a reasonable basis to believe unlawful drug-related activity is occurring or has occurred may detain the individual for the purpose of investigating whether the person is in violation of this section. 
                  (d)  A police officer may not detain an individual under this section unless both of the following elements are satisfied: 
                  (1)  In the presence or observation of the police officer, the person engages in one or more of the following behaviors: 
                  a.  The passing or receiving from a passerby, bystander or person in a motor vehicle money, objects having characteristics consistent with controlled substances, and/or an envelope, bag or other container that could reasonably contain such objects or money; 
                  b.  The concealing or attempting to conceal an object having characteristics consistent with controlled substances and/or an envelope, bag, clear plastic bag or other container that could reasonably contain such objects; 
                  c.  The fleeing or obscuring himself; 
                  d.  The communication to another person the fact that law enforcement officers are in the vicinity in a manner that suggests that the communication is a warning; or 
                  e.  The possession of any instrument or object that is designed or marketed as useful primarily for one or more of the following purposes: 
                  1.  To inject, ingest, inhale or otherwise introduce marijuana or a controlled substance into the human body; 
                  2.  To enhance the effect of marijuana or a controlled substance on the human body; 
                  3.  To test the strength, effectiveness, or purity of marijuana or a controlled substance; 
                  4.  To process or prepare marijuana or a controlled substance for introduction into the human body; 
                  5.  To conceal any quantity of marijuana or a controlled substance; or

                  b.  The officer has knowledge of a specific reliable tip concerning unlawful drug-related activity at a specific location, and the person who is found loitering is doing so at a time, in a place or in a manner that is otherwise consistent with the details provided in the tip; 
                  c.  The person is loitering in an area that has been designated a notorious drug-related activity area as defined in subsection (g) of this section; 
                  d.  The person is in an area where he is prohibited by court order from being, and the officer is aware of the court order; 
                  e.  The officer knows that the person has been previously convicted of loitering with the intention of engaging in unlawful drug-related activity under this section; or 
                  f.  Any vehicle the person has approached or communicated through is registered to an individual who has been convicted of an unlawful drug-related activity in the previous three years, and the officer is aware of that fact. 
                  (e)  No arrest may be made for a violation of this section unless the arresting officer first affords the person an opportunity to explain the person's presence and conduct, unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable to afford such an opportunity, and no one shall be convicted of violating this section if it appears at trial that the explanation given at the scene was true and disclosed a lawful purpose. 
                  (f)  If a police officer who detains a person pursuant to this section develops probable cause to believe that the person is in violation of this section, the officer may order the person to immediately leave the location and to remain at least 500 feet away from the location for at least five hours. In the event that person refuses to comply with such an order, the police officer may arrest the person and charge him with a violation of this section. 
                  (g)  The city council may, by written directive and after consultation with the chief of police, clearly and publicly designate areas of the city that are frequently associated with excessive incidents of drug-related offenses, including offenses involving controlled substances, as defined in O.C.G.A. tit. 16, ch. 13, or marijuana. The chief of police shall file such designations with the city clerk, with the clerk of the municipal court and with the clerk of the superior court. Prior to recommending such a determination under this subsection, the chief of police shall consult, as he deems appropriate, with persons who are knowledgeable about the effects of drug-related activity in areas in which this section may be enforced. Such persons may include, but need not be limited to, members of the department of police with special training or experience related to drug-related activity; other personnel of that department with particular knowledge of drug-related activities in the proposed designated area; appointed and elected officials of the area; and community-based organizations. The chief of police shall develop and implement procedures for the bi-annual review and update of any designations made under this subsection.

                  Sec. 21-1. - Purpose and findings. 
                  The city council further finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and to the city's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. The city, further, finds that signs have become excessive and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, are confusing to the public and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the city. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the city in enacting the ordinance from which this chapter is derived are as follows: 
                  (1)  To protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to implement the policies and objectives of a comprehensive development plan of the city through the enactment of a comprehensive set of regulations governing signs in the city; 
                  (2)  To regulate the erection and placement of signs within the city in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unnecessary and unsafe distractions to drivers or pedestrians; 
                  (3)  To preserve the value of property on which signs are located and from which signs may be viewed; 
                  (4)  To maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts; 
                  (5)  To maintain for the city's residents, workers and visitors a safe and aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interest of the city; 
                  (6)  To establish comprehensive sign regulations that effectively balance legitimate business and development needs with a safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors to the city; 
                  (7)  To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for advertisement by the business community located within the city so as to promote the economic vitality of local businesses; 
                  (8)  To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the state constitution and the United States Constitution with the city; 
                  (9)  To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of those districts; 
                  (10)  To allow certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this chapter but without a requirement for permits; 
                  (11)  To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances; 
                  (12)  To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs; and 
                  (13)  To provide for the maintenance of signs, and to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

                  (a)  Procedure. The director shall deny permits to applicants that submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this chapter, incomplete applications, and applications containing any false material statements. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this chapter, the director shall revoke the permit. Should the director deny or revoke a permit, the reasons for the denial or revocation are to be stated in writing and hand delivered, by electronic mail, or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application on or before the 45th business day after the director's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, instead of the date of the original submission. Violation of any provision of this chapter and any other applicable state laws or city ordinance regulating signage will be grounds for denying a permit or revoking a permit granted by the city for the erection of a sign. No permit shall be denied or revoked, except for due cause as hereinafter defined. "Due cause" is the violation of the provisions of this chapter, other applicable ordinances, state or federal law regulating signage, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing false material statements. 
                  (b)  Appeals. The zoning board of appeals shall have the power and duty to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in the denial or revocation of a sign permit under this chapter. All such appeals shall be heard and decided following the notice requirements of subsection (c) of this section and pursuant to the following criteria and procedural requirements: 
                  (1)  Appeal of decision by administrative officials. A denial or revocation pursuant to this chapter shall be appealable by filing with the secretary of the zoning board of appeals an application for appeal on the forms provided by the community development department specifying the grounds thereof, within 15 calendar days after the action appealed from was taken. The application fee for an appeal under this section shall be the same as that established by the city council for an appeal under chapter 27. 
                  (2)  Decision of the board. Following the consideration of all testimony, documentary evidence, and matters of record, the board shall make a determination on each appeal. An appeal shall be sustained only upon an expressed finding by the board that the administrative official's action was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or that the administrative official acted in an arbitrary manner. In exercising its powers, the board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit provided all requirements imposed by all other applicable laws are met. 
                  (3)  Time for final decision. A final decision will be rendered by the board within 90 days from date an appeal is filed. If a final decision is not rendered within the 90-day period, the decision sought to be appealed shall be reversed. 
                  (c)  Notice of public hearings. Notice of public hearing before the board on any application for appeal or variance shall be provided as follows:

                  (2)  Public notification signs shall be posted within the public right-of-way or on the subject property at least 15 days before the hearing before the board. One sign shall be posted for each 500 feet of street frontage or fraction thereof along each street on which the subject property has frontage. Signs shall be double-faced and posted so that the face of the sign is at a right angle to the street in order that said signs can be read by the traveling public in both directions. The lettering on the signs shall be printed and at least one inch in size and the sign shall state the nature of the proposed application and the date, time and place of the public hearing before the board; and 
                  (3)  Notice of the nature of the proposed application and the date, time and place of the public hearing before the board shall be published in the newspaper of general circulation within the city in which are carried the legal advertisements of the city at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing before the board and not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing before the board. 
                  (4)  The cost of all signs posted, and notice mailings sent, pursuant to this section shall be specifically paid by the applicant in addition to all other applicable application costs. 
                  (5)  Applications may be withdrawn by the applicant or applicant's representative in writing without prejudice at any time before the vote of the zoning board of appeals on the application. All fees submitted shall be forfeited in any case where the application is withdrawn after it has been advertised for a public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation. 
                  (d)  Certiorari. In the event a person whose permit has been denied or revoked is dissatisfied with the decision of the zoning board of appeals, a person may petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court of the county as provided by law.

                  A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been completed and fully installed within six months after the date of issuance; provided, however, that where an applicant can demonstrate that a contractor was timely engaged to construct the permitted sign, but the fabrication has not yet been completed due to the fault of the contractor, one 60-day extension may be granted by the director or his designee. No refunds will be made for permit fees paid for permits that expired due to failure to erect a permitted sign. If an individual later desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule applicable at such time.

If polygons established around wall signs located on the same street oriented wall are within 24 inches or less of one another, then the area of the sign shall be measured within one continuous polygon. For double-faced signs, the side of the sign with the largest sign area shall be used in computing the sign area. 
                  (b)  The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of existing grade prior to construction or the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is greater. Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height limitations are applied (surveyor's certificate required).

                  Sec. 23-162. - Funding. 
                  (a)  Assessment. Each owner of property abutting the sidewalks shall be assessed a share of the cost to be funded by the district, which cost shall be added to the ad valorem property taxes for each owner as provided in this section. No assessment shall be made against abutting property, unless the same is consented to in writing by the owners of 51 percent of the property abutting such improvements. Abutting shall mean adjacent to, contiguous with, or adjoining. 
                  (b)  Pro rata costs. Each property owner's share of the cost shall be determined as follows: The total cost of the project shall be calculated by the city, and the figure so derived shall be known as the total project cost. The city shall next determine the linear feet of sidewalk that was constructed. The total cost shall then be divided by the total linear feet of sidewalk to derive the cost per foot. Each property owner abutting the sidewalks shall then be assessed an amount that equals the linear feet of street frontage the property owner has multiplied by the cost per foot. 
                  (c)  Payment. The sidewalk tax assessment shall be paid by one of two options, as follows: 
                  (1)  Option 1. The assessment may be paid in cash by the property owner within 90 days of the mailing of the assessment by the city. If paid under this option, the assessment will not bear an administrative fee and no lien shall be recorded against the property. Payment shall be made to city and delivered to the public works department. If payment is not made in full within 90 days of the city's initial billing of the assessment, then payment option two shall automatically take effect. Once option two is in effect, the payment via option two shall be the property owner's sole option until all assessment payments are satisfied. 
                  (2)  Option 2. The assessment shall be paid in five equal annual installments. Payment of each such assessment shall be due and payable within 60 days from the mailing by regular mail of a bill from the tax commissioner. In the event option two is selected, the cost of processing, administration, recording the lien, and satisfaction of such lien shall be added to the assessment. 
                  (d)  Notification to purchaser. The property owner shall advise any purchaser of its property within the sidewalk district of the assessment. The property owner may conduct a proration of the assessment with the purchaser. The city shall not be responsible for the proration of the assessments between sellers and purchasers nor shall the city be under any duty to notify any purchaser of the existence or liability for the assessment. 
                  (e)  Collection when not paid. If the assessment is not paid when due, the assessment shall be collected in the same manner as delinquent ad valorem taxes and shall be subject to the same interest and penalties. 
                  (f)  Lien. The assessment shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recorded by the tax commissioner in the lien records of the clerk of the county superior court. 
                  (g)  Processing fee. The fee for processing and administration of this option shall be established by the public works department and approved by the city council.

                  Sec. 24-143. - Collection by innkeeper; receipt to occupant; reporting and remittance of taxes collected. 
                  Every innkeeper in the city shall collect a tax of eight percent on the amount of rent from the occupant unless an exemption is provided under section 24-142. The innkeeper shall provide a receipt to each occupant, which receipt shall reflect both the amount of rent and the amounts of this and other taxes applicable. This tax shall be due from the occupant, and shall be collected by the innkeeper at the same time that the rent is collected. The innkeeper shall be liable to the city for the full amount received or collected as tax, whether collected appropriately or inappropriately; and for any amount of tax that should have been collected, but was not. 
                  (1)  Liability of innkeeper. Any person who receives or collects the tax or any consideration represented to be the tax from another person holds the amount so collected in trust for the benefit of the city and is liable to the city for the full amount collected, plus penalty and interest. An individual who controls or supervises the collection of the tax from another person, or an individual who controls the accounting for or remittance of the tax, and who willfully fails to remit or cause to be remitted the tax is liable as a responsible individual for an amount equal to the tax not remitted or caused to be remitted, plus penalty and interest. The dissolution of a corporation, partnership or other business or fraternal association does not affect a responsible individual's liability under this subsection. Furthermore, the liability imposed by this subsection shall be in addition to any other penalty provided by law. 
                  (2)  Return; remittance; time of filing; innkeeper required to file; contents. On or before the 20th day of the month succeeding each monthly period, a return for the preceding monthly period together with appropriate remittance shall be filed with the city finance department. The return shall report the gross rent, taxable rent, exempt rent, amount of tax collected or otherwise due for the period, and such other information as may be required by the tax and license clerk. However, if the estimated tax liability for any monthly period shall exceed $2,500.00 for an innkeeper who, in the prior fiscal year remitted tax greater than $2,500.00 in any three consecutive months, such lodging provider shall file an estimated return and remit not less than 50 percent of the estimated tax liability for the monthly period by the 20th day of that same monthly period. The amount of tax so remitted shall be credited against the amount to be due with the regular return for the monthly period to be filed on the 20th day of the succeeding month. 
                  (3)  Extension of time of filing; authority; requirements; remittance; penalty and interest. The city manager may, for good cause, extend the time for making returns for not longer than 30 days. No extension shall be granted more than once in any calendar quarter. An innkeeper granted an extension shall remit a tax equaling not less than 100 percent of the tax paid for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year; such remittance to be made on or before the date the tax would otherwise come due without the grant of extension. No penalty or interest shall be charged during the first ten days of the extension period. Thereafter, interest shall be collected on the unpaid balance at the rate of one percent per month. 
                  (4)  Collection fee allowed innkeepers. Innkeepers collecting the tax shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting and paying the amount due, if the amount is not delinquent at the time of payment. The rate of the deduction shall be three percent of the amount due, but only if the amount due was not delinquent at the time of payment.

                  No tax shall be collected from an occupant who has occupied any guest room for more than 30 continuous days; or from an occupant who certifies in writing that he is staying in such accommodations as a result of his residence having been destroyed by fire or other casualty; or from the United States, the State of Georgia, or any instrumentality of either thereof; or from any official or employee of the state, its units of local government or any other instrumentality of the state, when traveling on official business and presenting written substantiation thereof or paying by state or local government credit or debit card; or from a foreign sovereign enjoying exemption by treaty or consular convention, when presenting substantiation issued by the United States Department of State.

Delinquent amounts shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, until paid. 
                  (c)  Acceptance of delinquent return and remittance without imposing penalty and interest; authority; requirements. If the failure to make any return or to pay the amount of tax by the due date results from providential cause shown to the satisfaction of the governing authority of the city by affidavit attached to the return, and remittance is made within ten days of the due date, such return may be accepted exclusive of penalty and interest. 
                  (d)  Penalty for fraud. In the case of a false or fraudulent return, or of failure to file a return where willful intent exists to defraud the city of any tax due, a civil penalty of 50 percent shall be assessed.

                  (b)  A maximum of 100 linear feet of water main will be installed by the water service provider for each petitioner without charge. If additional footage is required to serve all petitioners, the petitioners shall reimburse the water service provider for any excess footage at the per-linear-foot charge of an eight-inch line based upon the actual estimated cost of construction. This sum shall be on a pro rata basis or in a specified amount for each petitioner listed on the petition with the total of the amounts specified equaling the total reimbursable cost. Pro rata costs shall be equally divided based on the total number of petitioners rather than on the length required to cover the frontage of each petitioner.

                  (1)  In the event the water service provider's plans for future water service call for a main to be installed larger than the size of the main required to supply the development, then the water service provider may pay the difference in cost of the materials to install the size main required by the water service provider. The comparison of material costs will be based upon the water service provider's material cost for the larger pipe. Payment by the water service provider will be made upon completion and satisfactory inspection of the work and upon receipt of a maintenance bond equal to ten percent of the cost of the construction of the water to ten percent of the cost of the construction of the water facility. The developer may provide a letter of escrow or letter of credit acceptable in lieu of the maintenance bond required in this section. An eight-inch main will be considered as the minimum size main required to supply a development of any size. 
                  (2)  Water main design shall be accomplished by water service provider's water system engineers unless otherwise authorized by the water service provider.

                  (5)  The developer shall be required to maintain the water lines for a period of 12 months. During this developer maintenance period, the water service provider shall make inspections and instruct the developer by letter as to what corrections must be made, if any. 
                  (6)  At the end of the 12-month developer maintenance period, the water service provider shall make a final inspection and notify the developer and the bonding company, if any, of any corrections to be made. If the work is acceptable at this time, the maintenance bond, letter of escrow or letter of credit shall be released. 
                  (7)  If required corrections are not made within 30 days of notice, the water service provider shall have the authority to make these corrections at the expense of the bonding company. In cases where funds are being held under letter of credit or letter of escrow, the cost of making these corrections shall be drawn by the water service provider from these funds, and the developer charged with any costs above the amount of such funds. 
                  (8)  The water service provider shall have full authority to inspect, test and sterilize all water mains installed under this section. 
                  (9)  No use shall be made of such systems nor shall the water service provider accept such systems until the developer has complied with all the requirements of this section and until satisfactory sterilization and tests have been completed.

                  (a)  Definitions. The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. Where words have not been defined, but are defined in section 1-2, those words shall have the meaning as defined therein. 
                  Apartment means one or more rooms with a private bath and kitchen facilities comprising an independent self-contained residential unit in a buildings. 
                  Condominium is defined in the same manner as it is defined in section 27-18. 
                  Master meter means a utility-owned meter that measures and totalizes the volume of water flowing from the water distribution system into a multifamily dwelling unit as that term is defined in section 27-18, building piping system. 
                  Newly constructed apartment means any structure for which a building permit for construction of an apartment is issued after June 1, 2008. 
                  Newly constructed single-family dwelling or condominium means any structure for which a building permit for construction of a single-family dwelling or condominium is issued after June 1, 2008. 
                  Separate water meter means a utility-owned meter that measures and totalizes the volume of water flowing from the water distribution system into a single-family dwelling or condominium's piping system. 
                  Single-family dwelling is defined in the same manner as it is defined in section 27-18 but also includes dwelling units on an individual lot attached to another dwelling unit by a common party wall, commonly referred to as a townhouse or town home. 
                  Sub-unit water meter means water meters owned and managed by the property owner with a utility-owned master meter that bills for water service based on volume of use. Sub-unit water meters shall allow for the water use in each apartment to be tracked separately. 
                  (b)  Meters. All users except those classified as fire line users shall be metered. All meters shall be sized on the basis of expected volume of water usage. All meters, except sub-meters, are part of the service line provided by the water service provider and are the property of the water service provider. 
                  (c)  Sub-unit water meters for newly constructed apartments. No water shall be furnished to any newly constructed apartment except through sub-unit water meters so that the water use in each apartment can be accurately tracked. Sub-unit water meters allow tenants to know how much water they use and may encourage wiser use of water. Water service however, shall be billed by the water service provider on a master meter basis and the property owner and/or landlord is responsible for paying the water service provider for all charges contained in such bills. The enactment of the ordinance from which this section is derived in no way prevents property owners and/or landlords from using sub-unit water meters to bill each tenant for actual water usage which will encourage wiser use of water by tenants in apartments. 
                  (d)  Separate water meters for single-family dwellings and condominiums. No water shall be furnished to any newly constructed single-family dwelling or condominium except through separate water meters. Water service shall be billed by the water service provider to the property owner based on individual unit water meters and each property owner is responsible for paying the water service provider for all charges contained in such bills.

                  All plumbing or yard piping connections to a service line shall be subject to inspection by an authorized person prior to service connection. Refusal to allow inspection shall result in refusal of service until inspection is permitted. Inspection may include requirement that plumbing and piping plans be submitted where, in the director's opinion, possibility of system contamination or cross connection may result from service connection. In no case shall service connection be made until all inspection requirements are met.

                  Sec. 25-176. - Refusal of service. 
                  Water service may be refused only for the following justifications; reapplication may be made where reasons are rectified: 
                  (1)  Refusal to allow entry. Where admittance to property for necessary work or inspection is not allowed, the water service provider may refuse service. 
                  (2)  Damage to system by connection. Where in the opinion of the city or water service provider that connection will seriously reduce system pressure and fire protection, the water service provider may refuse service. 
                  (3)  Remoteness from system. Where connection requires investment in transmission mains that would not be justified by likely revenues, the water service provider may refuse service or require substantial cost sharing by the customer. 
                  (4)  Technical infeasibility. Where connection would require special pumps or other devices to effect service, the water service provider may refuse service or require substantial cost sharing by the customer. 
                  (5)  Health hazard. Where connection could cause contamination of the system, the water service provider may refuse service. 
                  (6)  Unpaid water bills. New connections or reconnections shall not be made until all previous financial obligations to the system have been met or resolved. This subsection only applies to owner-occupied property. 
                  (7)  Fraudulent misrepresentation in application. If water service has been approved for a location, and thereafter it is determined that the application for the water service contained false or misleading information or omitted material facts, or that the water is being used in or upon the premises for purposes not set forth in the application made for the water service, then the water shall be shut-off by the water service provider, and shall remain shut-off by the water service provider, until the application for water service has been corrected to the satisfaction of the water service provider or until all unauthorized use of water has ceased and any past due sums payable for the water service account have been fully paid to the water service provider.

                  The following list of system users establishes classifications of service as a basis of charges: 
                  (1)  Single. All dwelling, commercial and industrial customers are in this classification who use all of the water supplied through a connection for any use besides fire protection. 
                  (2)  Fire line. A customer shall only use the connection applied for under this classification for fire protection. 
                  (3)  Combined potable and fire line. Any shopping center and/or other development served by a combination potable and fire line located outside the public right-of-way shall be classified as a combined potable and fire line user, where either of the following exists: 
                  a.  A fire line main is served through a master meter with potable water service taken from that fire line main within the development. 
                  b.  Potable water is taken from the fire line through multiple meters. 
                  (4)  Multiple. No multiple dwelling, commercial or industrial customers shall be on one meter, except in case of apartments, shopping centers and office parks, where in the judgment of the water service provider multiple meters are impractical. Approved multiple category customers shall have one meter per premises and shall be charged as single category users. 
                  (5)  Temporary. Temporary use permits shall be granted for periods not exceeding 30 days. After permit expiration the water service provider may, at its option, renew the permit or assign the customer to a permanent classification. This service shall not be used for permanent installation.

                  (1)  Service. All classifications of users except fire line shall be billed a base charge for service availability, whether service is used or not. This charge shall be fixed on the basis of meter size. For combined potable and fire line users who provide a specific means of determining the requirements of the development, such as by the installation of private meters by the owner, the service charge shall be based on the number and size of private meters installed. 
                  (2)  Commodity. All classifications of users except fire line shall be billed a commodity charge in addition to a service charge on the basis of actual volume of water delivered at the single unit volume rate set by the water service provider. 
                  (3)  Fire line. Fire line customers shall be billed for service availability on the basis of diameter of connection to system mains and number of fire hydrants on premises. If a building complex has establishments each with different owners, then the fire line charges will be prorated by the water service provider based on square footage protected. For combined potable and fire line users: 
                  a.  Where fire hydrants are installed on private lines served through a master meter and/or where such lines serve building sprinkler systems, the owner will be billed for fire service availability on the basis of diameter of connection required to the system mains for fire protection only and on the number of hydrants. There will be no charge, however, for any hydrant which is determined by the county to be adjacent to and available to a public roadway. In addition, potable water readiness to serve charge will be based on the size line required for estimated average flow based on commodity billing as determined by the water service provider. 
                  b.  Where an owner elects to dedicate lines and rights-of-way outside the public road right-of-way in order to utilize multiple meters and where such lines have hydrants installed or serve building sprinkler systems, the owner will be billed for fire service availability on the basis of diameter of connection required to the system mains for fire protection only and on the number of fire hydrants. There will be no charge, however, for any hydrant which is determined to be adjacent to and available to a public roadway. If a building complex has establishments each with different owners, then the fire line charges will be prorated by the water service provider based on square footage protected. 
                  (4)  Contract. Contract service is only by agreement. Billing shall be on the basis of a service charge plus metered volume of water delivered at the unit volume rate set by the contract. Billing shall be at equal periods set by the contract and not less than semiannually.

                  (2)  Unauthorized activity. Such actions include any connection to or tampering with the system without prior approval of the water service provider. Charges assessed shall reflect the water service provider's assessment of costs involved in inspecting such work or in taking remedial action. Additionally, persons involved shall be assessed such charges as would apply were the work preauthorized and shall be subject to other penalties. 
                  (3)  Replacement of improvements. Persons engaged in work affecting or connecting to the system shall bear the total cost of replacement of any improvements or for making such improvements whole again.

After due notice, the city may elect to proceed with restorative work and charge the damaging person on a materials and force account basis. 
                  (4)  Service termination. A single charge shall be set for termination of service whether initiated by the customer or by the water service provider. Customers relocating within the system service area must terminate old service and make new application. 
                  (5)  Reconnection fee. A charge shall be set for resumption of service to a customer where termination was due to failure to pay bills. New or relocated customers using an existing service line are charged under this subsection. All previous bills shall be paid before a service reconnection will be made. This subsection only applies to owner-occupied property. 
                  (6)  Meter testing. The water service provider may periodically test all meters on its system. A customer may request a test to be made without charge. 
                  (7)  Tap fee. A fee shall be set by the water service provider for providing a connection for a service line or water main to an existing or new water main. Fee shall be based on diameter of service line or water main to be connected to the tap. 
                  (8)  Inspection and sterilization. The water service provider shall establish a list of charges for inspection and line sterilization which shall apply to various categories of construction, duly reflecting force and material requirements. 
                  (9)  Temporary use. Temporary use charges shall be set by the water service provider on a case-by-case basis; such fees shall be no less than the sum of appropriate recurring charges and miscellaneous charges. Such temporary uses, whether connected to mains or fire hydrants, shall be metered. Fire hydrant connections shall also be approved by the department of fire and rescue services. 
                  (10)  Other services. For any services not falling within these definitions, the water service provider may fix a charge on the basis of cost of labor and materials required.

                  Sec. 25-290. - Sanitary sewer main extensions. 
                  (a)  The sanitary sewer main extension policy shall apply to the extension or replacement of existing sanitary sewer mains on existing roads or other dedicated rights-of-way to serve new developments. A developer may request the application of this policy if a project site is not adjacent to an existing main or the existing main is inadequate to serve the proposed development. 
                  (b)  The developer may apply for preapproval of the sewer main extension application with the understanding that such reimbursement shall be made only after the developer has complied with all the requirements of this section. Conversely, the developer may apply for reimbursement after complying with all the requirements of this section and such reimbursement shall be made on approved applications if funds are available for that purpose. Approval of all application requests shall be within the sole discretion of the sewer system provider. 
                  (c)  Sanitary sewer mains approved and installed under this section shall be subject to the following conditions: 
                  (1)  All materials shall meet the specifications of the sewer system provider. 
                  (2)  A sanitary sewer main design shall be prepared by and furnished to the sewer system provider by a registered professional engineer licensed by the state. 
                  (3)  The developer shall contract for the installation of the sewer lines and shall furnish the city and sewer system provider a copy of the contract. When the work has been completed according to the sewer system provider specifications and duly inspected by the city or sewer system provider, the developer shall provide "as-built" drawings and any required easements of the sewer main installation to the sewer system provider. As-built drawings shall be completed under the direction of an engineer/land surveyor licensed in the state and sealed. 
                  (4)  After the work has been completed and inspected to the satisfaction of the city or sewer system provider, the developer shall provide a maintenance bond equal to ten percent of the costs of the construction of such facilities. The developer may provide a letter of escrow or letter of credit acceptable to the sewer system provider in lieu of the maintenance bond required in this section. 
                  (5)  After receiving the maintenance bond, letter of escrow or letter of credit, the sewer system provider shall reimburse the developer a sum equivalent to 50 percent of the cost of the sewer main materials required to supply the proposed development. An eight-inch main will be considered as the minimum size main required to supply a development of any size. In the event the sewer system provider's plans for future sewer service call for a sewer main to be installed larger than the size of the main required to supply the development, then the sewer system provider may: 
                  a.  If the size of sewer main planned by the sewer system provider is 15 inches or smaller, pay the difference in cost of the materials to install the size main required by the sewer system provider's plans. 
                  b.  If the size of sewer main planned by the sewer system provider is greater than 15 inches, pay the difference in both the cost of labor and materials to install the size main required by sewer system provider plans. 
                  (6)  The developer shall be required to maintain the sanitary sewer lines for a period of 12 months. During this developer maintenance period, the sewer system provider shall make inspections and instruct the developer by letter as to what corrections must be made, if any. 
                  (7)  At the end of the 12-month developer maintenance period, the sewer system provider shall make a final inspection and notify the developer and the bonding company, if any, of any corrections to be made. If the work is acceptable at this time, the maintenance bond, letter of escrow or letter of credit shall be released. 
                  (8)  If required corrections are not made within 30 days of notice, the sewer system provider shall have the authority to make these corrections at the expense of the bonding company. In cases where funds are being held under letter of credit or letter of escrow, the cost of making these corrections shall be drawn by the city or sewer system provider from these funds, and the developer charged with any costs above the amount of such funds. 
                  (9)  The sewer system provider shall have the full authority to inspect and test all sanitary sewer mains installed under this section. 
                  (10)  No use shall be made of such systems nor shall the sewer system provider accept such systems until the developer has complied with all the requirements of this section and until satisfactory tests and inspections have been completed by the sewer system provider. 
                  (11)  In calculating sewer system provider participation for material costs, the maximum material costs considered will be the sewer system provider's contract price for like material. 
                  (d)  Private sanitary sewer extensions will not be accepted for maintenance by the sewer system provider unless materials used for installation are inspected and approved by the sewer system provider prior to construction and are found to meet sewer system provider specifications and unless the installation was inspected by the city or sewer system provider during construction.

                  Sec. 25-291. - Submission of petition. 
                  (a)  Whenever the owners, as listed on the latest ad valorem tax digest, of 51 percent or more of the property within any designated area petition the sewer system provider for sewer facilities, and this action requires the laying of a lateral sewer, the petition shall be filed with the department. The petition shall be examined to see if the signatures are valid and if it sufficiently describes the services required. Then the sewer system provider shall initiate a preliminary engineering survey to make sure that the proper designated area is described. Cost for construction and engineering services are also estimated at this time. The petition is then advertised and a public hearing is held. If the petition is approved construction will be programmed. 
                  (b)  All assessments against property and the owners thereof for the construction of sewers shall be liens upon the property from the date of adoption of the resolution authorizing the construction of the sewer lines.

                  When a petition for the construction of a sanitary sewer line has been filed on behalf of a person or when a recommendation for construction has been made by the head of any board or department, then a public hearing must be held before the governing authority of the sewer system provider. The department shall notify the governing authority of the impending petition. The department shall then give notice to all persons concerned by publication of a notice in the newspaper where sheriff's notices are published for a period of at least 20 days prior to the hearing. The notice shall state the date and location of the proposed public hearing and shall give a general description of the proposed sanitary sewer construction.

                  In addition to the published notice of a public hearing on a petition for sanitary sewer construction, all owners of property abutting the proposed sanitary sewer line who shall be assessed for the cost of construction shall be notified in writing by the department at least 20 days prior to the hearing. The sewer system provider shall comply with the intent of this section by addressing all notices to the owners listed on the latest ad valorem tax digest at the addresses indicated. The records of the sewer system provider showing evidence of the mailing of the notices shall be prima facie evidence, and failure of the owner of any property concerned to receive a notice shall in no way affect the validity of the proceedings or the assessment. The purpose of this written notice is to furnish the owner with an additional statement of the public hearing.

                  At the hearing provided for in this division, any person whose property or interests are affected by the proposed sanitary sewer may appear before the governing authority either in person or through an agent or attorney. All evidence relevant to the question, whether in support or in objection, may be presented. The decision of the governing authority with respect to the approval or rejection of the proposed sanitary sewer shall be final and conclusive. Any decision by the governing authority in favor of the construction shall indicate a public need for the sanitary sewer, and this shall make all matters pertaining to the construction of the sanitary sewer and the assessment of costs against the abutting property owners legal and binding.

                  Sec. 25-295. - Procedure after plans and specifications received. 
                  When the sewer system provider has received plans, specifications and necessary engineering data, it shall determine the names of all property owners affected and procure the necessary right-of-way for construction of the sanitary sewer line as specified. Before final approval of any plans, the sewer system provider must also ensure that sufficient stub-out connections are designated to adequately serve the territory affected.

                  Sec. 25-296. - Performance of construction. 
                  All sanitary sewers shall be constructed by the sewer system provider or by their designated contractors. All sanitary sewer construction performed by a private contractor shall be guaranteed against defects in contractor-supplied material and workmanship for a minimum period of one year from the final inspection date. Construction is under the supervision of the sewer system provider.

                  Sec. 25-297. - Assessments generally. 
                  (a)  After the construction of a sanitary sewer line has been completed, the department shall make up an assessment roll properly describing the sanitary sewer line and containing the names of all owners of abutting property. Each owner's property abutting the sanitary sewer shall be correctly described as it pertains to the construction. The cost of the sanitary sewer shall then be shared among the various property owners on a prorated basis depending on the number of linear feet each has abutting the sanitary sewer line. The actual assessment shall be calculated using a value in dollars and cents per linear foot based on the average cost for construction of all petitioned sanitary sewer lines in the sewer system provider's service area in the previous year. Assessment rates shall be approved by the sewer system provider on an annual basis. 
                  (b)  The minimum assessment shall be for 65 feet, whether or not a sanitary sewer line has to extend that distance to service a property or not. 
                  (Ord. No. O2013-01-55, § 25-184, 1-22-2013) 
                  Sec. 25-298. - Assessment computations; double-frontage lots, owners previously assessed, residences not totally served by gravity sewer. 
                  (a)  Whenever a tract of land abuts a sanitary sewer line on both the front and the rear, and the tract of land cannot be subdivided into two or more separate lots fronting each of the abutting sewers, then the property shall be assessed only for the side with the greater frontage. 
                  (b)  Several considerations shall be made before determining whether or not a tract of land can be subdivided. If the topography of the land makes it impractical to construct a building on one of the lots, or to provide sanitary sewer service to one of the lots, then the tract of land is not suitable for subdivision. 
                  (c)  Property owners who have contributed to the cost of existing sanitary sewers, whether by private contract, the original subdivisions or previous assessment, shall be exempted from current assessment. However, if property owners or previous owners did not contribute to the construction cost of existing sanitary sewers, they shall be assessed in the same manner as any other abutting property owner. 
                  (d)  When all floor levels of a residential unit are not served by the sewer by gravity, then the property will be assessed a percentage of the total assessment equal to a percentage of the total number of fixtures in a house or building that are actually served by the sewer main by gravity.

                  Sec. 25-299. - Assessment of corner property. 
                  Corner property shall be assessed under this division in the following manner: 
                  (1)  Where the sanitary sewer abuts the property only on the front, the property shall be assessed for the amount of frontage. 
                  (2)  Where the sanitary sewer abuts the property on both the front and side, the property shall be assessed for the frontage; the first 150 feet of the side abutting shall be exempted from assessment; the next 100 feet of the side abutting shall be subject to assessment; and the remainder of the side abutting beyond 250 feet shall be treated as outfall sewer and not assessed. 
                  (3)  Where the sanitary sewer abuts the property on the side only, the property shall be assessed for the frontage; the first 150 feet abutting on the sides shall be exempted; the next 100 feet of the sides abutting shall be subject to assessment; and the remainder of the side abutting beyond 250 feet shall be treated as outfall sewer and not assessed. 
                  (4)  Where the sanitary sewer abuts property that is pie-shaped or has an unusual frontage and that frontage is greater than the largest normal-shaped and assessed property, the property will be assessed for the same number of front feet as the largest, normal-shaped assessable property in the petitioned area. The sewer system provider shall have the responsibility for determining what properties are to be considered pie-shaped or unusual.

                  Sec. 25-300. - Outfall sewers. 
                  (a)  In this section, the term "outfall sewer" means a section of sanitary sewer line, either in a public street or across private property, which normally does not provide direct service to the abutting property. Usually the outfall sewer is a section of a trunk sewer providing service to several street sanitary sewers serving properties and its cost is not included in the assessment rate. However, when an outfall does provide direct service to the abutting property, the cost of constructing the outfall shall be assessed against the abutting property owners. 
                  (b)  Property owners desiring connection to outfall sewers may do so with concurrence of the director and shall pay an assessment based on the current year linear foot rate prior to their obtaining a sewer connection permit. 
                  (c)  Exceptions to the provisions of this section may be granted by the department upon application.

                  Whenever a sanitary sewer line has been constructed in accordance with this division and the cost thereof has been assessed against the benefiting property, then the respective owners shall be notified of the assessment and they shall be required to pay in cash, within 60 days, to the finance department, the amount of the assessment. If the amount of the assessment causes a financial burden on the owner, then the owner may extend the assessment and pay it in annual installments. However, no less than one-fifth of the total assessment shall be paid within 60 days after notification.

                  If the property owner requires an extension in the payment of an assessment under this division, then the owner must execute in writing an extension agreement with the sewer system provider stating that the owner shall pay a 20 percent down payment and, in a maximum of four equal annual installments, the amount of the assessment, less the cash down payment put forth on the due date. The extension agreement must be executed on or before the due date of the assessment. In the agreement, the owner must acknowledge the fact that throughout, the extension remains legal and valid, and all liens remain in force. The unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at a rate specified by the Code. Interest charges shall be assessed from the due date and shall be included in the installments. The agreement shall be negotiable in form, and the sewer system provider shall reserve the right to transfer or assign it to third parties. If ever the owner defaults in the payment of any installment, then the entire assessment shall immediately become due and payable.

                  Sec. 25-305. - Assessments after previous exemptions. 
                  (a)  The department may grant property abutting sanitary sewer lines an exemption from assessment. Often this occurs when the sewer system provider, by negotiating an easement, uses private property in the laying of a sanitary sewer line. Property thus exempted can be connected to the sewerage system at any future date without being liable for assessment. 
                  (b)  If, however, the property was exempted for another reason, such as the elevation of the property, and it is improved at a later date to a condition whereby sanitary sewer service can be attained and is required, then, if this occurs within 25 years after the completion of the sanitary sewer, the property is subject to assessment under the provisions of this division. If the improvement occurs more than 25 years after construction, the property may not be assessed.

                  Sec. 25-306. - Service connections. 
                  (a)  After sanitary sewer lines have been constructed and tied into the sewerage system, each abutting property owner who has contributed to the costs of construction through assessment may desire a service connection. To make such a connection, the property owner shall hire, at the owner's expense, a plumber or contractor to lay pipe from the building drain to the stub-out provided. Before this service line can be connected to the sanitary sewer, the owner shall secure a permit from the sewer system provider by paying a plumbing fee and a sewer tap fee. If the service line then passes the inspection criteria of the sewer system provider, the owner may have it connected into the sewerage system. 
                  (b)  When no stub-out or other means of connection is provided so as to service the building drain, it shall be the responsibility of the sewer system provider to provide a stub-out for the property owner at no cost if the property owners, present or past, have contributed to the cost of the existing sewer either by the original subdivision or by assessment. 
                  (c)  When a property owner desires connection to the sewerage system after construction of the sanitary sewer line, and no owner of the property has contributed to the costs of constructing the sanitary sewer line, the owner must pay a proportionate cost of construction based on the current year linear foot rate prior to obtaining a sewer connection permit.

                  Sec. 25-377. - Appeals. 
                  (a)  Any user may appeal an altered or new permit condition or alleged violation of a current permit condition to the department. Such appeal must be received within 30 work days. The department shall schedule an appeal review meeting within 30 days to discuss the appealed condition of this division or wastewater discharge permit and corrective or remedial action to be taken. 
                  (b)  If the user and the department can agree to appropriate corrective remedial or preventive measures, such measures and a reasonable compliance schedule shall be incorporated as a supplemental condition of the user's wastewater discharge permit. If an agreement is not reached through the conciliation process, the department shall refer the appeal to the governing authority and the governing authority shall review the appeal and adjudge the dispute. The sewer system provider shall then institute such actions as deemed advisable to ensure the user's compliance with the provisions of this division or other laws or regulations.

                  (a)  The city and sewer system provider shall comply with the regulations for public participation as applicable under federal, state or local law. 
                  (b)  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, monitoring programs and from the sewer system provider's inspection and sampling activities shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law, or that such information is otherwise protected from disclosure under applicable federal or state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public. It shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving persons furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.

                  Sec. 25-380. - Significant noncompliance. 
                  The director shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" means: 
                  (1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
                  (2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD; TSS; fats, oils and grease; and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
                  (3)  Any other discharge violation that the director believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
                  (4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director's exercise of his emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
                  (5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in the wastewater discharge permit; 
                  (6)  Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
                  (7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
                  (8)  Any other violations which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

                  Sec. 25-381. - Penalties and enforcement. 
                  (a)  Upon determination that a violation of this article has occurred, the director shall serve upon that discharger a written notice of violation. Within 15 days of receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific actions, shall be submitted by the violator to the department. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
                  (b)  The director may order a discharger which has violated, or continues to violate, any provisions of this article to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served by registered or certified mail, or by personal service on the user or the authorized representative of the user. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the discharger. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the discharger. 
                  (c)  When the director finds that a discharger has violated, or continues to violate, any provisions of this division or that the discharger's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the discharger directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the discharger to: 
                  (1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
                  (2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation and to prevent recurrence of the violation. 
                  Each day of violation of a cease and desist order, after notice thereof, shall constitute a violation of this division, and shall constitute a separate violation of this division, subject to the maximum fine or imprisonment, or both, set forth in section 1-11. 
                  (d)  Violation of the provisions of this article constitutes an infraction subject to a penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 per day per violation, imprisonment in jail for a term not exceeding 30 days, or by labor on the work gang for 60 days for any single offense, in accordance with section 1-11. The city or their authorized agents may institute appropriate action or proceedings at law or equity for the enforcement of this division or to correct violations of this division. Any court of competent jurisdiction may have the right to issue restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions and other appropriate forms of remedy or relief. Each day of noncompliance is considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the county from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation, including application for injunctive relief. 
                  (e)  When the director finds that a discharger has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, the director may petition the courts for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the requirements imposed by this article on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the discharger to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking other action against a discharger. 
                  (f)  The director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the county, including, but not limited to, containment, cleanup, injury, death and other.

                  Sec. 25-382. - Permit revocation. 
                  The director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
                  (1)  Failure to notify the director of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge; 
                  (2)  Failure to provide prior notification to the director of changed conditions pursuant to this article; 
                  (3)  Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application or any other required reporting; 
                  (4)  Falsifying self monitoring reports or other required reporting; 
                  (5)  Tampering with monitoring equipment; 
                  (6)  Refusing to allow the director timely access to the facility premises and records; 
                  (7)  Failure to meet effluent limitations; 
                  (8)  Failure to pay fines; 
                  (9)  Failure to pay sewer charges; 
                  (10)  Failure to meet compliance schedules; 
                  (11)  Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge permit application; 
                  (12)  Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business ownership of a permitted facility; 
                  (13)  Change of any condition that requires either temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the permitted discharge; or 
                  (14)  Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this chapter. 
                  Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to that user.

                  Sec. 25-383. - Permit modification. 
                  The director may modify any permit in whole or in part during its term for cause including, but not limited to, the following: 
                  (1)  Violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this chapter; 
                  (2)  Engaging in any act that would constitute basis for revocation of the permit; 
                  (3)  For purpose of incorporating any new or revised federal, state or local pretreatment standard or requirements; 
                  (4)  For purpose of addressing significant alterations or additions to the user's operation, processes or wastewater volume or character since the time of wastewater discharge permit issuance; 
                  (5)  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the POTW, personnel, or the receiving waters; 
                  (6)  Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required reporting; 
                  (7)  Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical pretreatment standards pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13; 
                  (8)  To correct clerical or other errors in the wastewater discharge permit; or 
                  (9)  Changing any condition that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the permitted discharge.

                  Sec. 25-384. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
                  (a)  Upset. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(3) of this section are met. 
                  (3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset; 
                  b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
                  c.  The user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
                  1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance; 
                  d.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof; 
                  e.  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards; and 
                  f.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
                  (b)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 25-414(a) or the specific prohibitions in section 25-414(b)(3) through (7) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  (1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
                  (2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the county was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permits, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
                  (c)  Bypass. 
                  (1)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subsection (c), shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c)(3) and (4) of this section. 
                  (3)  Prior notice. 
                  a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (4)  Certain conditions resulting in exemption from enforcement action. 
                  a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
                  3.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
                  b.  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(4)a of this section.

                  Sec. 25-419. - Industrial discharges and surcharges. 
                  (a)  Industrial contributors to the public sanitary sewer system shall be required to pay a sewer rate surcharge based upon the concentration of total suspended solids (TSS), five-day BOD, ammonia and/or total phosphorus in their effluents. Industrial dischargers whose wastes contain greater than 250 mg/l of either five-day BOD and/or total suspended solids, 30 mg/l ammonia, or ten mg/l total phosphorus shall pay the surcharge in an amount set by the sewer system provider. 
                  (b)  If values for any constituent exceed two times the minimum surcharge concentration (i.e., 500 mg/l TSS) then the director may, if determined that these wastes adversely affect the POTW, require the industrial user to install pretreatment before discharging wastes to the public sanitary sewer system. This pretreatment must reduce the concentration of the wastes by treatment/removal of the excess constituent to the point where it no longer harms the POTW, and the values for all constituents are less than two times the minimum surcharge concentration. 
                  (c)  Periodic determination of the values for constituents subject to surcharge shall be made on composite samples of industrial effluents by personnel of the sewer system provider.

                  Sec. 25-420. - Discharges requiring pretreatment. 
                  The sewer system provider may require pretreatment of wastewater to an acceptable condition before discharge to the public sanitary sewer system when wastewaters contain the substances or possess the characteristics of prohibited or limited discharges. Pretreatment may also be required if these wastewaters cause upset, interference or pass through at the POTW or have a deleterious effect upon any other aspect of public welfare, either alone or in combination with other discharges. In addition to lowering the concentrations of substances to an acceptable level through pretreatment or altering the characteristics of a wastewater, the sewer system provider may require additional controls before discharge to the public sanitary sewer system. In particular, quantities or rates of discharge shall be altered so that the discharge becomes more compatible with the sewer system. Expenses incurred in the installation and operation of these controls shall be borne by the industrial user.

                  Sec. 25-421. - Dilution. 
                  No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
                  (Ord. No. O2013-01-55, § 25-260, 1-22-2013) 
                  Sec. 25-422. - Measurements, tests and analyses, and sample collection. 
                  (a)  Any measurements, tests, analyses, sample types, sample containers and/or holding times to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with procedures and specifications as set forth in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
                  (b)  Analyses shall be determined at the control manhole, or upon a suitable sample taken at the control manhole. If no control manhole is available on the building sewer, the control manhole shall be considered the nearest downstream manhole to which the building sewer is directly connected. When the director deems it necessary, the owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole on the building sewer to facilitate observation and sampling of wastes. This manhole, when required, shall be accessible, safely located, and constructed at the owner's expense in accordance with county specifications. 
                  (c)  Except as indicated in subsection (d) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite sampling techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
                  (d)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

                  (a)  In the case of accidental spills, loss to the drains of any deleterious material or substances, discharges of a non-routine nature, non-customary batch discharges or slug loads, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the sewer system provider of the incident. This notification shall include the time of occurrence, location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume if known and corrective actions taken by the user. The user shall take all possible actions to prevent a spill, and should a spill occur, shall take immediate steps to ensure no recurrence of the incident. Industrial users which store or otherwise handle toxic, hazardous or flammable materials must have an accidental discharge/slug control plan in place to prevent the discharge, accidental or otherwise, of the materials to the sewer system. 
                  (b)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall submit a detailed written report, unless waived by the director, describing the causes of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
                  (c)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (a) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

                  The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend the user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
                  (1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the order, sewer connection, and/or termination of water supply, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed. 
                  (2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement to the director, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. 
                  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

                  Sec. 25-466. - Inspections and authority to enforce regulations. 
                  (a)  Authority to inspect. The compliance inspectors shall inspect food service establishments on both an unscheduled and unannounced basis or on a scheduled basis. All food service establishments may be inspected up to four times per year. Inspection of a FOG interceptor shall be performed at frequencies necessary to protect the capacity of the sewer system against the accumulation of FOG in an amount that would exceed the 20 percent rule. Inspection shall include all fixtures, equipment, food processing, and storage areas, and shall include a review of the processes that produce wastewater discharged from a facility through the FOG interceptor. Any deficiencies shall be noted, including but not to be limited to: 
                  (1)  Failure to report changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
                  (2)  Failure to properly maintain the FOG interceptor; 
                  (3)  Failure to maintain logs, files, records, or access for inspection or monitoring activities; 
                  (4)  Failure to obtain or renew the FOG discharge permits in a timely manner; or 
                  (5)  Any other violations of these regulations or state law that requires correction by the food service establishment. 
                  (b)  Right of entry. Where it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions of these regulations or where the FOG control program manager or designee has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in a building or structure or upon a premises a condition which is contrary to or in violation of the applicable provisions of this Code, the FOG control program manager or designee is authorized to enter the building, structure or premises at reasonable times to inspect or perform any of the duties imposed by the applicable provisions of this Code. If such building, structure, or premises is occupied, the inspector shall present credentials to the occupant and shall request entry. If such building, structure, or premises is unoccupied, the inspector shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person having charge or control of the building, structure, or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the inspector shall have recourse to the remedies provided by law for entry. In the event of an emergency involving actual or imminent sanitary sewer overflow, the inspector may access adjoining businesses or properties that share a sewer system with a food service establishment in order to prevent or remediate an actual or imminent sewer overflow.

                  Sec. 25-467. - Noncompliance fees, letters, and schedules. 
                  (a)  Reinspection fee. Any food service establishment in noncompliance with the terms and conditions specified in its permit or with any provision of these regulations shall pay a noncompliance fee. The purpose of the noncompliance fee is to compensate the city and/or the sewer system provider for costs of additional inspections, followups, sampling, monitoring, laboratory analysis, treatment, disposal, and administrative processing incurred as a result of the noncompliance, and shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any penalties as may be assessed pursuant to these regulations. Noncompliance fees shall be in the amount adopted by action of the governing authority. 
                  (b)  Noncompliance letters. Immediately following every inspection and/or FOG evaluation, the food service establishment inspected shall receive a letter indicating the results of the inspection. A certified letter of noncompliance means the food service establishment is in violation of the applicable provisions of this Code. Letters of noncompliance shall include a description of the code being violated and the immediate course of action the food service establishment shall be required to take to come into compliance. Failure to comply with a letter of noncompliance is also a violation of these regulations. 
                  (c)  Compliance schedule. Upon determination that a food service establishment is noncompliant with the terms and conditions specified in its permit or any provision of these regulations or needs to construct and/or acquire and install a FOG interceptor, the FOG control program manager may also issue and require the food service establishment to abide by a compliance schedule. The issuance of a compliance schedule may contain terms and conditions including, but not limited to, requirements for installation of a FOG interceptor and facilities, submittal of drawings or reports, audit of waste hauling records, best management and waste minimization practices, payment of fees, or other provisions to ensure compliance with these regulations. 
                  (d)  Fees. The FOG control program manager shall not issue a compliance schedule until such time as all amounts owed by the food service establishment to the city and/or sewer system provider are paid in full. If compliance is not achieved in accordance with the terms and conditions of a compliance schedule, the FOG control program manager may issue an order suspending or revoking the FOG wastewater discharge permit.

                  (a)  Grounds to suspend or revoke. The FOG control program manager may suspend or revoke any permit when it is determined that a food service establishment: 
                  (1)  Fails to comply with the terms and conditions of a noncompliance letter or compliance schedule order; 
                  (2)  Destroys, removes, conceals, or knowingly provides a false statement, representation, record, report, or other document to the city or county; 
                  (3)  Refuses to provide records, reports, plans, or other documents required by the city or county to determine permit terms or conditions, discharge compliance, or compliance with these regulations; 
                  (4)  Falsifies, tampers with, destroys, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or sample collection method; 
                  (5)  Does not make timely payment of all amounts owed to the city and/or county for user charges, permit fees, or any other fees imposed pursuant to these regulations; 
                  (6)  Causes interference, a sewer blockage, or a sanitary sewer overflow in the sewer system, violates FOG interceptor maintenance requirements, violates any condition or limit of its FOG wastewater discharge permit, or violates any provision of these regulations; or 
                  (7)  Refuses to accept a notice by personal service or certified mail. 
                  (b)  Notification. 
                  (1)  When the FOG control program manager has reason to believe that grounds exist for permit suspension or revocation, he shall give written notice thereof by certified mail to the food service establishment setting forth a statement of the facts and grounds deemed to exist, together with the time and place where the charges shall be heard by the director. The hearing date shall be not less than 15 calendar days or more than 45 calendar days after the mailing of such notice. 
                  (2)  At the suspension or revocation hearing, the food service establishment shall have an opportunity to respond to the allegations set forth in the notice by presenting written or oral evidence. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with written procedures established by the director. The director shall conduct the hearing and shall render a decision in writing within 30 calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing. 
                  (3)  The written decision and order of the director shall be sent by certified mail to the food service establishment at the food service establishment's business address. Upon an order of suspension or revocation by the FOG control program manager becoming final, the food service establishment shall immediately cease and desist its discharge and shall have no right to discharge any wastewater containing FOG directly or indirectly into the public sewer system for the duration of the suspension. All costs for physically terminating and reinstating service shall be paid by the food service establishment. Any owner or responsible management employee of the food service establishment shall be bound by the order of suspension or revocation. Upon an order of revocation by the FOG control program manager becoming final, the food service establishment shall permanently lose all rights to discharge any wastewater containing FOG directly or indirectly to the public sewer system. All costs for physical termination shall be paid by the food service establishment. 
                  (4)  An order of permit suspension or revocation issued by the FOG control program manager shall be final in all respects on the 16th day after it is mailed to the food service establishment. 
                  (c)  Damage to facilities or interruption of normal operations of the sewer system. Any person who discharges any waste which causes or contributes to any sewer blockage, sanitary sewer overflows, obstruction, interference, damage, or any other impairment to the public sewer system and/or equipment, or to the operation of those facilities and/or equipment shall be liable for all costs required to clean and/or repair the facilities and/or equipment, together with expenses incurred by the city and sewer system provider to resume normal operations. A service charge of 25 percent of the city and sewer system provider's costs shall be added to the costs and charges to reimburse for miscellaneous overhead, including administrative personnel and recordkeeping. The total amount shall be payable within 45 days of invoicing. Any person who discharges a waste which causes or contributes to the sewer system provider violating its discharge requirements established by any regulatory agency incurring additional expenses or suffering losses or damage to the facilities and/or equipment shall be liable for any costs or expenses incurred by the city and/or sewer system provider, including regulatory fines, penalties, and assessments made by other agencies or a court. 
                  (d)  Termination of water service to the food service establishment. The city, sewer system provider, or water service provider by order of the FOG control program manager, may physically terminate water service to any property as follows: 
                  (1)  If so ordered in any order of suspension or revocation of a permit; or 
                  (2)  Upon the failure of a person not holding a valid FOG wastewater discharge permit to immediately cease the discharge, whether direct or indirect, to the public sewer system after the issuance of a final order or suspension or revocation. 
                  All costs for physical termination of the water service shall be paid by the owner or operator of the food service establishment as well as all costs for reinstating service. 
                  (e)  Emergency suspension order. The city, sewer system provider, or water service provider may, by order of the FOG control program manager or designee, suspend water service when the FOG control program manager or designee determines that such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or impending discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health and welfare of persons, or to the environment, or may cause sanitary sewer overflows, sewer blockages, interference to the public sewer facilities, or may cause the city, sewer system provider or water service provider to violate any state or federal law or regulation. Any discharger notified of and subject to an emergency suspension order shall immediately cease and desist the discharge of all wastewater containing FOG to the sewer system. 
                  (f)  Emergency suspension hearing. As soon as reasonably practicable following the issuance of an emergency suspension order, but in no event more than five business days following the issuance of such order, the director shall hold a hearing to provide a food service establishment the opportunity to present information in opposition to the issuance of the emergency suspension order. Such a hearing shall not stay the effect of the emergency suspension order. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with written procedures established by the director. The director shall issue a written decision and order within two business days following the hearing, which decision shall be sent by certified mail to the food service establishment at that food service establishment's business address. This decision shall either lift the emergency suspension order or suspend or revoke the permit subject to the suspension and revocation appeal process set forth in these regulations.

                  Sec. 25-492. - Levied. 
                  A service charge is levied and assessed for the operation and maintenance of the sewer system. This charge is based on the amount of potable water consumed per month by each contributor to the sewer system. The rate at which this charge is levied shall be as established by action of the governing authority of the sewer system provider. The charges imposed by this article may be periodically revised at the discretion of the governing authority of the sewer system provider. A readiness-to-serve charge is imposed for the operation of the sewer system based on the size of the customer's water meter. A surcharge for overstrength waste, i.e., wastes consisting of total suspended solids and/or five-day biochemical oxygen demand materials in concentrations exceeding 250 mg/l, ammonia in concentrations exceeding 30 mg/l, and total phosphorus exceeding ten mg/l, is levied at a rate approved and adopted by the board of commissioners.

                  The sewer system provider shall prepare for each contributor to the sewerage system a monthly or bimonthly notice of the amount due. This notice shall be addressed and mailed to the address as designated by the owner or occupant of the property. Payment is due in full ten days from date notice is mailed, and shall be in default if not paid on or before the 20th day after the date of the notice. Failure to receive the notice in no way relieves the occupant of liability for the amount due.

                  O.C.G.A. § 12-5-27.1 provides that whenever a local government entity is required by the environmental protection division to reduce phosphorus in its wastewater being discharged into the waters of the state, such local government entity shall pass an ordinance mandating the retail sale of low phosphorus household laundry detergent as part of its phosphorus reduction process. It is declared to be the public policy of the city to encourage the use of clean phosphate-free household laundry detergents and to prohibit the sale of household laundry detergents which contain more than 0.5 percent phosphorus by weight. The city finds that such use and sale will be a cost-effective way to reduce the amount of phosphorus in wastewater discharge so as to protect Georgia's rivers and lakes downstream; promote health, safety, and welfare; and prevent injury to human health, plant and animal life, and property. It is vital to the health, well-being, and welfare of present and future inhabitants of the city that these sources be protected against contamination and pollution.

                  ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

                  Sec. 25-555. - Findings. 
                  The mayor and city council makes the following findings: 
                  (1)  The city is authorized by the supplementary powers provisions of Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, ¶ III(a)(6) to provide a stormwater collection and disposal system throughout the city. 
                  (2)  The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 USC 1251 et seq.), and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act emphasizes the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and funding stormwater programs which address water quality impacts of stormwater runoff. 
                  (3)  Given the project cost of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses performed by the county and obtained by the city, it is appropriate to adopt a stormwater service fee rate methodology and to charge service fees to properties and persons within the city in a manner that recovers the cost of programs, systems and facilities and other costs associated therewith, including but not limited to allocations of the cost of services provided to the stormwater management utility by other funds of the city and other government entities and agencies, interest on bonds, operational and emergency reserves, allowances for delinquencies and bad debt, and such other costs as may be deemed reasonable and appropriate by the mayor and city council to ensure the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater programs, systems and facilities in the city. 
                  (4)  The stormwater conditions reflected in the study conducted by the county and obtained by the city reflect the current conditions of the stormwater system in the city. 
                  (5)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city. Stormwater service fee rate methodology and service fees should be applicable throughout the city to enable the city to successfully manage operate and improve stormwater programs, systems and facilities at an advanced level. Service fees will also assist the city in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits by reducing pollution and increasing water quality within the city. 
                  (6)  The stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Funding of stormwater programs, systems and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the city in protecting the public health, safety and welfare. 
                  (7)  Provision of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities renders and/or results in both services and benefits to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses, and the services and benefits differ among the individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems and facilities. 
                  (8)  The services and benefits rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is not practical to allocate the cost of the city's stormwater management programs, systems and facilities in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time, but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the long-term demands they impose on the city's stormwater programs, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits. 
                  (9)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs.

                  A stormwater service fee bill may be sent though the United States mail or by alternative means, notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. The stormwater service fee bill may be billed and collected along with other fees and charges, including but not limited other utility bills, assessments or property taxes, as deemed most effective and efficient by the city manager. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fees and other charges and any associated fines or penalties, including but not limited to interest on delinquent service fees. If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may backbill for a period of up to one year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency during that back-billed period. A late charge of one percent of the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility service fee bill shall be charged when a bill becomes delinquent.

Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner or developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. From the date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the superior court of the county. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section.

                  (7)  Where areas appear to be unclassified on the zoning map, and classification cannot be established by the above rules, such areas shall be considered to be classified R-200 until action is taken by the city council to amend the zoning map.

                  (2)  Density of development and types of residential use. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted in a community development subdivision shall not exceed 4.5 dwelling units per net residential acre (total developable acreage minus that to be used for NS and OI uses as provided in this section). Not more than 40 percent of the dwelling units shall be multifamily. Not less than 60 percent of the dwelling units shall be single-family. One-half of the single-family dwelling units may be attached, but not less than one-half of the single-family lots or within a cluster housing subdivision. 
                  (3)  Minimum development requirements. The minimum lot area, width, and yard requirements permitted within a community development subdivision for single-family lots, multifamily dwellings and business lots shall be as follows: 

                   
                  (4)  Minimum floor area. The minimum floor area shall be as follows: 
                  a.  For a single-family dwelling, 1,200 square feet. 
                  b.  For a single-family attached dwelling, 1,000 square feet. 
                  c.  For a two-family dwelling containing: 
                  1.  One bedroom, 600 square feet. 
                  2.  Two bedroom, 750 square feet. 
                  3.  Three or more bedrooms, 1,050 square feet

                  2.  Two bedrooms, 800 square feet. 
                  3.  Three or more bedrooms, 1,000 square feet. 
                  Notwithstanding the above minimum floor area requirements, a maximum of 20 percent of the total units constructed in any single development of more than one building may be one bedroom units having floor areas of less than 650 square feet but not less than a minimum floor area of 520 square feet. 
                  (5)  Maximum height of structures. The maximum height of any structure shall be 40 feet.

                  (7)  Open space requirement. Not less than 20 percent of the subdivision shall be set aside for open space purposes. A homeowner's association created by the developer, by recorded covenants, declarations and restrictions running with the land, shall preserve and maintain for the use and benefit of the owners and occupants of lots and dwellings within the subdivision the lands set aside for open space, parks and recreational use. The book and page in which such covenants and declarations are recorded shall be shown on the final plat of the subdivision. Required yards, streets, drives, parking areas and other similar uses shall not be created toward the minimum open space requirements. Not more than 50 percent of the land reserved for open space purposes shall be within a floodplain. The requirement that open space be deeded to and maintained by a homeowner's association may be waived by the city for that portion of an R-CD district in which detached single-family housing is constructed. This waiver and survey to which there is entered a covenant by the developer at the minimum open space requirement shall be applied to individual lots within the subdivision. Dedication of open space to the city may also satisfy the open space requirement. 
                  (8)  Neighborhood shopping and office-institution uses. The developer of a community development subdivision of not less than 100 acres may set aside not more than five percent of the total area for neighborhood shopping and office-institution uses permitted herein. However, retail liquor stores shall not be permitted unless these uses are housed within a planned shopping center constructed within a minimum of 10,000 square feet in a continuous facade. Not more than 50 percent of the five percent may be reserved and developed for NS uses. When 100 or more dwelling units have been constructed within the subdivision, then NS uses may be established under the following conditions: 
                  a.  Not more than 240 square feet of floor space for retail sales and services shall be permitted for each ten dwelling units in the subdivision. There shall be not less than four square feet of business lot area for each one square foot of permitted retail floor area. Land may be reserved for the maximum permitted retail development but the permitted square feet of retail area may be built only as the required ratio of dwelling units has been constructed. 
                  b.  Retail sales and services shall be constructed entirely within a wholly and permanently enclosed building or buildings, which shall be of an architectural design compatible with the residential structures within the subdivision. 
                  c.  Outdoor storage or displays of any kind shall be prohibited. 
                  d.  Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided as required by this chapter. 
                  e.  This use shall only be placed on lots specifically designated for these purposes on the plat of the subdivision, and shall be located at least 100 feet from any residential structure. Accessory parking and loading areas shall be located at least 50 feet from any residential structure. 
                  f.  When shopping facilities within a planned unit development subdivision contain not less than 40,000 square feet of floor area, then the development standards established by this chapter for planned shopping developments shall apply. 
                  g.  The sides, rear or front of a lot developed for retail sales and services shall neither abut nor be across the street from property lying outside the subdivision, and shall be located at least 300 feet from any exterior subdivision property line.

                  4.  Meet all applicable requirements of this subsection (8) except subsections (8)a and f of this section.

The use to be made of each lot shall be marked on the plat. The plat shall also state the maximum number of dwelling units authorized for the subdivision. When approved, the final plat shall be recorded in the same manner as other subdivision plats along with the necessary covenants and restrictions applicable to the development. In addition, a faithful reproduction of the plat shall be predominantly displayed within the subdivision until such time as the subdivision is fully developed. 
                  (10)  Private deed covenants. The subdivision shall be covered by private deed covenants running with the land which ensure its continuance in accordance with approved plans and development.

                  (Ord. No. 2014-09-03, § I(27-461), 9-23-2014) 
                  Sec. 27-807. - Statement of purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose and intent of the city council in establishing the TND (Traditional Neighborhood Development) District is to establish a zoning district classification by which the city may permit a variety in type, design, and arrangement of residential structures and enable the coordination of project characteristics with features of a particular site in a manner consistent with the public health, safety, and general welfare. Appropriate areas for the location of Traditional Neighborhood Development Districts include tracts of land of sufficient size for the creation of traditional neighborhood development communities. Appropriate areas for the location of Traditional Neighborhood Development Districts further include tracts of land where there is the presence of waterways, floodplains, wetlands, natural and archaeological resources, or historic building or site, which areas do not lend themselves to development under standard subdivision requirements as are provided in chapter 14, article VII. The Traditional Neighborhood Development District is established so as to permit reasonable residential development of such properties while at the same time protecting and preserving important features of the natural and built environment and to permit innovative design of new communities, including traditional neighborhood development communities. TND (Traditional Neighborhood Development) Districts are intended to allow for innovations and special features in site development, including the location of structures, conservation of natural land features, conservation of energy and efficient utilization of open space. The TND (Traditional Neighborhood Development) District is further intended to accomplish public objectives as follows: 
                  (1)  To establish a zoning district classification within which traditional neighborhood development communities can be established within the city; 
                  (2)  To provide for residential development of parcels of land where a portion of the property is to remain undisturbed or in open space in perpetuity so as to preserve sensitive natural areas and to permit innovative community planning while realizing reasonable intensity of development on such parcels by clustering new dwellings on the most suitable building areas of such parcels of land; 
                  (3)  To ensure that infill development authorized pursuant to these district regulations is compatible with the density and the character of surrounding uses; and 
                  (4)  To ensure that basic services are available to serve the recreational, educational and social needs of the neighborhood.

                  The purpose and intent of the city council in establishing the NCD (Neighborhood Conservation) District is to establish a zoning district classification by which the city may permit a variety in type, design, and arrangement of residential structures and enable the coordination of project characteristics with features of a particular site in a manner consistent with the public health, safety, and general welfare. Appropriate areas for the location of a NCD (Neighborhood Conservation) District include existing neighborhoods where the characteristics of traditional neighborhood development communities can be preserved. The NCD (Neighborhood Conservation) District is established so as to permit reasonable residential development of vacant properties in the defined neighborhood while at the same time protecting and preserving important features of the natural and built environment and to permit innovative design of new housing. The NCD (Neighborhood Conservation) District is further intended to accomplish public objectives as follows: 
                  (1)  To establish a zoning district classification wherein certain established neighborhoods can be preserved within the city; 
                  (2)  To prevent these neighborhoods and subdivisions from becoming nonconforming under the terms of this division. Any such established neighborhoods will be allowed to continue to exist and develop further under the general regulations governing their design and development in accordance with any plats or plans previously approved; 
                  (3)  To ensure that infill development authorized pursuant to these district regulations is compatible with the density and the character of surrounding uses; and 
                  (4)  To ensure that basic services are available to serve the recreational, educational and social needs of the neighborhood.

                  The purpose and intent of PC-1 district regulations is to encourage the development of comprehensively planned, pedestrian-oriented, and human-scaled places. The PC-1 district is to permit the flexible and compatible arrangement of residential, commercial, office, institutional, and civic uses, while preserving the significant and valuable features of the natural and artificial environment. The development of a PC-1 district should achieve the following public objectives: 
                  (1)  To maintain harmony of scale, intensity, and design with surrounding development; 
                  (2)  To provide for a variety of housing types and styles within a residential component; 
                  (3)  To facilitate easy and pedestrian-friendly access to compatible and neighboring commercial, civic, recreational, and institutional uses; 
                  (4)  To design and arrange structures, buildings, streets and open spaces to create an inviting, walkable, human-scale environment; 
                  (5)  To incorporate the significant and valuable environmental, historic, and archeological features of the zoning district into design of the pedestrian community; 
                  (6)  To provide the efficient and effective use of land within the pedestrian community;

The development of a PC-2 district should achieve the following public objectives: 
                  (1)  To maintain harmony of scale, intensity, and design with surrounding development; 
                  (2)  To provide for a variety of housing types and styles within a residential component; 
                  (3)  To facilitate easy and pedestrian-friendly access to compatible and neighboring commercial, civic, recreational, and institutional uses; 
                  (4)  To design and arrange structures, buildings, streets and open spaces to create an inviting, walkable, human-scale environment; 
                  (5)  To incorporate the significant and valuable environmental, historic, and archeological features of the zoning district into design of the pedestrian community; 
                  (6)  To provide the efficient and effective use of land within the pedestrian community; 
                  (7)  To strengthen the diversity and sense of residential harmony within the pedestrian community; 
                  (8)  To provide for connectivity of streets and communities and reduce the dependence on automobile uses by increasing the ease of movement and opportunities for alternative modes of travel; and 
                  (9)  To encourage a proportional relationship of surrounding buildings with respect to the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and street frontage by using techniques to achieve compatibility, such as: 
                  a.  Use of building silhouette: Pitch and scale of rooflines; 
                  b.  Use of additional facade detail: Proportion of facade elements, doorways, projections and insets; window scale and pattern; creation of strong shadow lines as decorative elements; 
                  c.  Use of unified setbacks from property lines; 
                  d.  Use of landscaping to unify buildings and define space; and 
                  e.  Use of compatible building materials.

                  The purpose and intent of PC-3 district regulations are to encourage the development of comprehensively planned, pedestrian-oriented, and human-scaled places. The PC-3 district is to permit the flexible and compatible arrangement of residential, commercial, office, institutional, and civic uses, while preserving the significant and valuable features of the natural and artificial environment. The development of a PC-3 district should achieve the following public objectives: 
                  (1)  To maintain harmony of scale, intensity, and design with surrounding development; 
                  (2)  To provide for a variety of housing types and styles within a residential component; 
                  (3)  To facilitate easy and pedestrian-friendly access to compatible and neighboring commercial, civic, recreational, and institutional uses; 
                  (4)  To design and arrange structures, buildings, streets and open spaces to create an inviting, walkable, human-scale environment; 
                  (5)  To incorporate the significant and valuable environmental, historic, and archeological features of the zoning district into design of the pedestrian community; 
                  (6)  To provide the efficient and effective use of land within the pedestrian community; 
                  (7)  To strengthen the diversity and sense of residential harmony within the pedestrian community; 
                  (8)  To provide for connectivity of streets and communities and reduce the dependence on automobile uses by increasing the ease of movement and opportunities for alternative modes of travel; and 
                  (9)  To encourage a proportional relationship of surrounding buildings with respect to the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and street frontage by using techniques to achieve compatibility, such as: 
                  a.  Use of building silhouette: Pitch and scale of rooflines; 
                  b.  Use of additional facade detail: Proportion of facade elements, doorways, projections and insets; window scale and pattern; creation of strong shadow lines as decorative elements; 
                  c.  Use of unified setbacks from property lines; 
                  d.  Use of landscaping to unify buildings and define space; and 
                  e.  Use of compatible building materials.
