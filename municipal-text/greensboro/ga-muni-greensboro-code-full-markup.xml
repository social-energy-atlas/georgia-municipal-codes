PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Greensboro, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2003 Code, as supplemented through May 19, 2014, and ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2003 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Kim Ryder, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Larry R. Postell, City Manager, Mr. Barry Fleming, City Attorney, and Ms. Robyn Mapp, Administrative Assistant, for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  (b)  In this section, the term "violation of this Code" does not include the failure of a city officer or city employee to perform an official duty, unless it is provided that failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this section or it is clear from the context that it is the intent to impose the penalty provided for in this section upon the officer or employee.

                  (1)  A person convicted of a violation of this Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00.

                  (3)  With respect to violations of this Code that are not continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues is a separate offense. 
                  (d)  The imposition of a penalty does not prevent revocation or suspension of a license, permit or franchise or other administrative sanctions. 
                  (e)  Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief and by such other means as are provided by law. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent equitable relief.

Any business coming before the city council concerning the subject matter of which any standing or special committee has jurisdiction, may be referred to the proper committee for investigation and report. It shall be the duty of each standing or special committee, whenever required by the mayor or by the city council, or any member of the city council, to examine any matter referred to such committee, and make a report thereof at the next regular meeting of the city council, or show good cause why no report is made, such reports shall not be in writing unless so directed by the presiding officer.

All such instruments shall have first been referred to the head of the department under whose jurisdiction the administration of the subject matter of the ordinance, resolution, or contract document would involve and be approved by said department head; provided, however, that if approval is not given, then the same shall be returned to the mayor with a written memorandum of the reasons why such approval is withheld. In the event the questioned instrument is not redrafted to meet a department head objection, or objection is not withdrawn and approval in writing given, then the mayor shall so advise the city council and give the reasons advanced by the department head for withholding approval.

                  d.  Effective date. Except as provided in Charter section 2.26, no ordinance shall take effect until five days after the date of its publication, except a public emergency ordinance necessary for the protection of public health, public safety, public property, or the public peace, may be made effective upon adoption. 
                  (9)  Recording vote. Whenever any member shall request it, the yeas and nays of the members present shall be recorded on the minutes on any question taken. 
                  (10)  Questions of order.

A dog shall at all times be restrained or enclosed upon the premises of the owner or person having the dog in care, possession, or custody, except as may be permitted under exceptions provided in this section. A dog may be tethered, attached to a stationary object or pulley system by a chain, rope, cable or similar device other than a leash for walking, as permitted under exceptions provided in this section. Any such restraint must be applied in a manner to protect the health and safety of the dog. A dog is properly enclosed when it is securely confined indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked pen, fence, or structure suitable to prevent entry of young children and designed to prevent the dog from escaping. 
                  (b)  Every parent or head of a household where a dog is kept shall be deemed to be a responsible party under and for purposes of this section, even though others might be equally responsible with him with respect to the same dog. The fact that a dog may be owned by a minor child shall be no defense to a parent who is head of a household. 
                  (c)  A dog not in a vehicle and securely confined therein, when away from the premises where habitually kept, shall be on a leash and under control of a person capable of controlling the dog and protecting others against harm. 
                  (d)  Whenever a dog is being transported in a vehicle, it shall not be taken from the vehicle or allowed to escape therefrom at any place other than where habitually kept, unless on a leash and in control of a capable person, as provide in subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  An owner shall not: 
                  (1)  Tether an animal within ten feet of public roads, public property, access, easement, common grounds, or the property of another without the express consent of said property owner; 
                  (2)  It shall be unlawful to tether an animal outdoors, except when all of the following conditions are met: 
                  a.  Only one animal may be attached to each tethering system. 
                  b.  Tethers must be made of a substance which cannot be chewed by the animal and shall be of an appropriate size and weight for the animal. 
                  c.  Any tethering device used to tether an animal must be at least ten feet in length and mounted not more than seven feet above the ground level and shall not allow the animal to come within ten feet of the edge of the property line of the property upon which such animal is tethered. 
                  d.  The animal must be attached to the tether by a property fitted harness or collar with enough room between the collar and the animal's throat to prohibit the choking or injury of the animal. 
                  e.  The tether must have a swivel installed at each end and be attached to a stationary object that cannot be moved by the animal. 
                  f.  The tethering system must be a sufficient distance from any other object and to prevent the animal from tangling of the cable, to prohibit the cable from extending over, around or through an object or an edge that could result in injury or strangulation of the animal. 
                  g.  The animal must be cared for in a humane manner.

                  Sec. 4-27. - Nuisance. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person to permit an animal under his ownership, possession, control, or care to be a nuisance at any time in the incorporated area of Greensboro. An animal shall be deemed to be a nuisance if it is permitted to go upon the property of another person other than its owner or keeper without the express consent of such property owner or occupancy; or if the animal attacks, or acts so as to menace pedestrians or other persons using public ways; or if an animal is left outside the residence of the owner or keeper after such animals has continued to bark for a period of 30 minutes; or if it defecates or urinates upon the property of another; or if is in heat and is not confined to the property of its owner or keeper. However, no person may be charged with a violation of this section as a result of excessive barking or other vocalizing unless a warning has previously been issued by an animal control officer within 30 days of the charge of a violation. Additionally, all violations under this section must be accompanied by a written and verified statement from a neighboring complainant giving the address of the owner, a description of the animal, a description of the offense, and the date, time, and location of the offense.

                  (1)  "Classified dog" means any dog that has been classified as either a dangerous dog or vicious dog pursuant to this article. No dog shall be classified as a dangerous dog or vicious dog for actions that occur while the dog is being used by a law enforcement or military officer to carry out the law enforcement or military officer's official duties. No dog shall be classified as a dangerous dog or a vicious dog if the person injured by such dog was a person who, at this time, was committing a trespass, was abusing the dog, or was committing or attempting to commit an offense under Chapter 5 of Title 16 of the Official Code of Georgia. 
                  (2)  "Dangerous dog" means any dog that: 
                  a.  Causes a substantial puncture of a person's skin by teeth without causing serious injury; provided, however, that a nip, scratch, or abrasion shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subparagraph; 
                  b.  Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury to such person or another person although no such injury occurs; provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling, or showing of teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subparagraph; or 
                  c.  While off the owner's property, kills a pet animal; provided, however, that this subparagraph shall not apply where the death of such pet animal is caused by a dog that is working or training as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator control dog. 
                  (3)  "Guard dog" means any dog that is maintained for the purpose of safety or security and which is trained to attack persons other than animals independently or upon verbal command. It shall be the duty of the owner, tenant, or custodian of any property on which a guard dog or security dog is kept for security purposes to post a notice in a prominent and conspicuous location on such property. Such notice shall consist of the words "warning—guard dog", and shall be in clearly distinguishable block letters upon a background of a clearly contrasting color and such letters shall be not less than one inch in width and not less than five inches in height. If a guard dog is confined within a fenced area, such notice shall be conspicuously posted upon such fence at each and every entrance and exit of such closure. 
                  (4)  "Serious injury" means any physical injury creates a substantial risk of death; results in death, broken or dislocated bones, lacerations requiring multiple sutures, or disfiguring avulsions; requires plastic surgery or admission to a hospital; or results in protracted impairment of health, including transmission of an infection or contagious disease, or impairment of the function of any bodily organ. 
                  (5)  "Vicious dog" means a dog that inflicts serious injury on a person or causes serious injury to a person resulting from reasonable attempts to escape from the dog's attack. 
                  (b)  Upon receiving a report of a dog believed to be subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog within a dog control officer's jurisdiction, the dog control officer shall make such investigations as necessary to determine whether such dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog. 
                  (c)  When a dog control officer determines that a dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog, the dog control officer shall mail a dated notice to the dog's owner within 72 hours. Such notice shall include a summary of the dog control officer's determination and shall state that the owner has a right to request a hearing from the Municipal Court on the dog control officer's determination within seven days after the date shown on the notice. The notice shall provide a form for requesting the hearing and shall state that if a hearing is not requested within the allotted time, the dog control officer's determination shall become effective for all purposes under this article. If an owner cannot be located within ten days of a dog control officer's determination that a dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog, such dog may be released to an animal shelter or humanely euthanized, as determined by the dog control officer. 
                  (d)  When a hearing is requested by a dog owner in accordance with subsection (c) of this code section, such hearing shall be scheduled within 30 days after the request is received; provided, however, that such hearing may be continued by the Municipal Court for good cause shown. At least ten days prior to the hearing, the Municipal Court conducting the hearing shall mail to the dog owner written notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing. At the hearing, the dog owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence and the Municipal Court conducting the hearing shall receive other evidence and testimony as may be reasonably necessary to sustain, modify, or overrule the dog control officer's determination. 
                  (e)  Within ten days after the hearing, the authority or probate court which conducted the hearing shall mail written notice to the dog owner of its determination on the matter. If such determination is that the dog is a dangerous dog or a vicious dog, the notice of classification shall specify the date upon which that determination shall be effective. If the determination is that the dog is to be euthanized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-26, the notice shall specify the date by which the euthanasia shall occur. 
                  (f)  Judicial review of Municipal Court's decision may be had in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 15-9-30.9. Judicial review of a probate court's final decision shall be in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 5-3-2 and costs shall be paid as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-3-22.

                  (a)  It shall be unlawful for any person or persons within the corporate limits of the City of Greensboro to engage in any conduct described in the following subsections; provided, however, that no person shall be convicted of any of the following sections upon a showing that the predominant intent of said conduct was to exercise a constitutional right: 
                  (1)  A person commits the offense of loitering or prowling when within the city he is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of person or property in the vicinity. 
                  (2)  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object.

                  (b)  If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, or is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the city attorney may file a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists, said complaint to be filed in municipal court pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, and upon the filing thereof, the following described action shall then be taken: 
                  (1)  Upon filing of the complaint, the court shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any interested parties in such dwelling, building, structure or property a summons and a complaint containing a notice that a hearing will be held in municipal court not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the serving of the complaint; that the owner and any interested parties shall be given the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or by attorney, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. 
                  (2)  The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the owner and interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. 
                  (3)  If, after the hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, structure, or property under consideration is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; or is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result or unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing its findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  a.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of such dwelling, building, structure, or property can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling, building, structure, or property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  b.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of such dwelling, building, structure, or property in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  (4)  If the court finds there is a condition or use of real estate other than addressed above, which renders adjacent real estate unsafe or inimical to safe human habitation and the court further finds that such use is dangerous and injurious to the health, safety and welfare of the people and that a public necessity exists for the repair of such condition or the cessation of such use, the court may order the cleaning or removal of debris, trash and other materials present and accumulated which create a health or safety hazard in or about any dwelling, building or structure, and the order may require the abatement of the public health hazard or general nuisance to eliminate the endangerment to the public health or safety. 
                  (5)  For the purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. 
                  (6)  The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, ch. 39A (O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq.), qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the city. 
                  (7)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, improve or demolish the dwelling, building, structure, or property, or to abate the nuisance to eliminate the endangerment to the public health or safety, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, structure, or property to be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Time during any court stay on abatement shall not count toward said 270 days. Upon initiation of the abatement, the public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, structure, or property a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (8)  The amount of the cost of any repair, alteration, improvement, removal or demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which cost was incurred. Credit for salvaged materials sold, per subsection (b)(12) of this section, shall be given. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order in the office of the clerk of the county superior court and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under this chapter. 
                  (9)  The clerk shall record and index such order in the deed records and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing the order with the clerk, and within 90 days of the repair, demolition or closure, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and notice given to the owner and interested parties and a final settlement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
                  (10)  It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property per O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1, and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. title 48, ch. 4 (O.C.G.A. § 48-4-1 et seq.); provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. 
                  (11)  The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (12)  If the dwelling, building or structure is removed or demolished by the public officer, reasonable efforts shall be made to salvage and sell reusable materials at private or public sale, and the proceeds of such sale shall be credited against the cost of the removal or demolition, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Such sale may be made without public advertisement and bid. The public officer and city shall have no liability related to such sale, including due to defects. Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. 
                  (13)  The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (14)  The redemption amount shall be the full amount of costs as determined above, plus interest, penalties and costs incurred by the city and the tax commissioner in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien shall be per O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80, 48-4-81.

                  ARTICLE II. - EXCAVATIONS 

                  Sec. 24-27. - Requirements. 
                  (a)  Permit required. It shall be unlawful for any person to dig up, break, excavate, tunnel, undermine, or in any manner break up any street, or to make or cause to be made any excavation in or under the surface of any street for any purpose, or to place, deposit, or leave upon any street any earth or other excavated material obstructing or tending to interfere with the free use of the street, unless such person shall first have obtained an excavation permit from the city manager-clerk/treasurer in the manner specified in this article. 
                  (b)  Excavation permit fee. The excavation permit fee to be collected by the city manager-clerk/treasurer shall be in an amount varying with the type of surface to be opened, dug, or excavated under the permit issued. A permit fee schedule shall be determined by the mayor and city council. 
                  (c)  Surety bond. Each applicant for an excavation permit shall be required to file a surety bond with the city manager-clerk/treasurer. A surety bond schedule shall be determined by the mayor and city council. The required surety bond must be: 
                  (1)  With good and sufficient surety approved by the city council; 
                  (2)  Satisfactory to the city attorney in form and substance; and 
                  (3)  Conditioned upon the permittee's agreement to secure and hold harmless the city and its officers against any and all claims, judgments, or other costs arising from the excavation and other work covered by the excavation permit or for which the city, the city council, or any city officer may be made liable by reason of any accident or injury to persons or property through the fault of the permittee either in not properly guarding the excavation or for any other injury resulting from the negligence of the permittee, and further conditioned on the permittee's agreement to fill up, restore, and place in good and safe condition as near as may be to its original condition, and to the satisfaction of the mayor and city council, all openings and excavations made in streets, and to maintain any street where excavation is made in as good condition for the period of 24 months after said work shall have been done, usual wear and tear excepted, as it was in before said work shall have been done. Any settlement of the surface within said two-year period shall be deemed conclusive evidence of defective backfilling by the permittee, except that nothing herein contained shall be construed to require the permittee to maintain any repairs to pavement made by the city if such repairs should prove defective. Recovery on such bond for any injury or accident shall not exhaust the bond, but it shall in its entirety cover any or all future accidents or injuries during the excavation work for which it is given. In the event of any suit or claim against the city by reason of the negligence or default of the permittee, upon the city's giving written notice to the permittee of such suit or claim, any final judgment against the city requiring it to pay for such damage shall be conclusive upon the permittee and its surety. 
                  (d)  Routing of traffic. The permittee shall take appropriate measures to ensure that during the performance of the excavation work, traffic conditions shall be maintained at all times as nearly normal as practicable so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to the occupants to the abutting property and to the general public, provided that the mayor and city council may recommend the closing of streets to all traffic for a period of time if in his opinion it is necessary. The permittee shall route and control traffic, including its own vehicles, as directed by the city police department. The following steps shall be taken before any highway may be closed or restricted to traffic: 
                  (1)  The permittee must receive the approval of the mayor and city council and the police department. 
                  (2)  The permittee must notify the fire chief of any street so closed. 
                  (3)  Upon completion of construction work the permittee shall notify the mayor and city council and the police department before traffic is moved back to its normal flow so that any necessary adjustments may be made. 
                  (4)  Where flagmen are deemed necessary by the police chief, they shall be furnished by the permittee at its own expense. Through traffic shall be maintained without the aid of detours, if possible. In instances in which this would not be feasible, the police chief will designate detours. The city shall maintain roadway surfaces of existing highways designated as detours without expense to the permittee, but in case there are not existing highways the permittee shall construct all detours at its expense and in conformity with the specifications of the mayor and city council. The permittee will be responsible for any damage caused to any highways by the operation of its equipment. 
                  (e)  Clearance for fire equipment. The excavation work shall be performed and conducted so as not to interfere with access to fire stations and fire hydrants. Materials or obstructions shall not be placed within 15 feet of fire plugs. Passageways leading to fire escapes or firefighting equipment shall be kept free of piles of material or other obstructions. 
                  (f)  Protection of traffic. The permittee shall construct and maintain adequate and safe crossings over excavations and across highways under improvement to accommodate vehicular and pedestrian traffic at all street intersections. Vehicular crossings shall be constructed and maintained of plank, timbers, and blocking of adequate size to accommodate vehicular traffic safely; pedestrian crossings shall be of adequate thickness, width, and length, together with necessary blocking, to ensure safe passage by pedestrians. 
                  (g)  Interference with utilities. The permittee shall not interfere with any existing utility without the written consent of the mayor and city council and the utility company or person owning the utility. If it becomes necessary to remove an existing utility, this shall be done by its owner. No utility owned by the city shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work be borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned utilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the person owning the utility. The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain, and protect them under, over, along, or across said work. In case any of said pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or apparatus should be damaged, they shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them, and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the permittee, and the bond of same shall be liable therefor. The permittee shall be responsible for any damage done to any public or private property by reason of the breaking of any water pipes, sewer, gas pipe, electric conduit, or other utility, and its bond shall be liable therefor. The permittee shall inform itself as to the existence and location of all underground utilities and protect the same against damage. 
                  (h)  Protection of adjoining property. The permittee shall at all times, and at its own expense, preserve and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where in the protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall obtain permission from the owner of such private property for such purpose. The permittee shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences, or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property or highways resulting from its failure properly to protect and carry out said work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area, the sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been back-filled. All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as near as possible to that which existed before such work began. The permittee shall not remove even temporarily any trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip areas or easements across private property without first having notified and obtained the consent of the property owner, or in the case of public property, the mayor and city council.

                  (3)  Acceptance or approval of any excavation work by the mayor and city council shall not prevent the city from asserting a claim against the permittee and its surety under the surety bond required hereunder for incomplete or defective work if such defects are discovered within 24 months from the completion of the excavation work. 
                  (q)  City's right to restore surface. If the permittee shall have failed to restore the surface of the street to its original and proper condition upon the expiration of the time fixed by the permit, or shall otherwise have failed to complete the excavation work covered by such permit, the mayor and city council, if he deems it advisable, shall have the right to do all work and things necessary to restore the street and to complete the excavation work.

The purpose of this article is to set uniform requirements for users of Greensboro's wastewater collection system and treatment works, to enable the city to comply with the provisions of the Clean Water Act (33 USC § 1251 et seq.) and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations including the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403), and to provide for the public health and welfare by regulating the quality of wastewater discharged into the city's wastewater collection system and treatment works. This article provides a means for determining wastewater volumes, constituents and characteristics, the setting of charges and fees, and the issuance of permits to certain users. This article establishes effluent limitations and other discharge criteria and provides that certain users shall pre-treat waste to prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned treatment works (hereinafter referred to as POTW), which will interfere with the operation of the POTW; contaminate the sewage sludge; pass through the treatment works, or otherwise be incompatible with the treatment works; and to improve opportunities to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and the sludge resulting from wastewater treatment. This article provides measures for the enforcement of its provisions and abatement of violations thereof. A primary objective of this article is to enable the city to comply with its NPDES permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other laws to which the city is subject. This article shall set fees for the equitable distribution of costs due to this article. The City of Greensboro's city manager will be ultimately responsible for the operation and maintenance of city wastewater facilities, and will enforce the provisions of this article. The city manager may delegate duties or grant powers to other city personnel with the mayor's and council's approvals.

                  (a)  Purpose, policy, and user responsibilities. This section establishes limitations and prohibitions on the quantity and quality of wastewater which may be lawfully discharged into the publicly owned treatment works (POTW). The specific limitations set forth in subsection (e) of this section and other prohibitions and limitations of this article are subject to change, to ensure that they are sufficient to protect the operation of the POTW, to enable the POTW to comply with its NPDES permit, to provide a cost effective means of operating the POTW, and to protect the public health and the environment. It shall be the responsibility of the person discharging industrial waste into the city sewerage system to: 
                  (1)  Build a control structure in the discharge line from his premises, immediately prior to the entrance of the discharge line into the city sewerage system, suitable for the sampling and measuring of waste. Plans for this structure must be approved by the city. This requirement may be waived if deemed unnecessary by the city. In the event that no special manhole is required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
                  (2)  Contact the superintendent prior to operational changes which will materially alter the characteristics of the waste from the last prior sampling. 
                  (3)  Make timely, periodic payments to the city of surcharges for excessive loading as detailed in the city user charge system. 
                  (b)  Where unpolluted wastes may be discharged. Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage may be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers approved by the city. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be discharged to a storm sewer, provided the requirements of the Georgia EPD are met and city approval is obtained. The discharge of domestic sewage and industrial waste to a storm sewer is prohibited. 
                  (c)  Prohibited pollutants. No person shall introduce into the POTW any pollutants which cause pass through or interference. These prohibitions apply to all users. No person shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any of the following: 
                  (1)  Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Centigrade using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21; 
                  (2)  Pollutants which will cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW, but in no case discharges with pH lower than 6.0, unless the works is specifically designed to accommodate such discharges; 
                  (3)  Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which will cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference; 
                  (4)  Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference with the POTW; 
                  (5)  Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the POTW treatment plant exceeds 40 degrees Centigrade (104 degrees, Fahrenheit) unless the approval authority, upon request of the POTW, approves alternate temperature limits; 
                  (6)  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through; 
                  (7)  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems; 
                  (8)  Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the POTW; 
                  (9)  Any liquids, solids, or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion so as to be injurious to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW.

                  (15)  Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. The installation and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of 0.75 horsepower or greater, shall be subject to the review and prior written approval of the city. Discharge of ground paper products to the sewer system is prohibited; 
                  (16)  Sludge, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes; 
                  (17)  Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the city in a wastewater discharge permit; 
                  (18)  Wastewater specifically identified as causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test; 
                  (19)  Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW; 
                  (20)  Quantities of flow, concentrations, or both which constitute a "slug" as defined in section 30-88; 
                  (21)  Any waters or wastes which, by interaction with other water or wastes in the public sewer system, releases obnoxious gases, form solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition deleterious to structures and treatment processes. 
                  (d)  Categorical pretreatment standards . Certain industrial users are now, or shall become subject to categorical pretreatment standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency specifying quantities or concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties, which may be discharged into the POTW. All industrial users subject to a categorical pretreatment standard shall comply with all requirements of such standard, and shall also comply with any additional or more stringent limitations contained in this section, or established by the State of Georgia. Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards for existing sources subject to such standards shall be within three years following promulgation of the standard, if the standard does not set a specific time period. Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards for new sources shall be required upon promulgation of the standard. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The city may impose mass limitations on industrial users that are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. Fixed alternative limits may be derived by the city in its discretion pursuant to 40 CFR 403.6(e). The categorical pretreatment standards at 40 CFR chapter 1, subchapter N, parts 405—471 are incorporated herein by reference. 
                  (e)  Limitations on wastewater strength and flow rate. In addition to any applicable categorical pretreatment standards, no user shall discharge wastewater to the POTW, which exceeds the city's daily maximum discharge limits developed by engineering studies and approved by the mayor and city council. The following limits currently apply to all industrial users and will be updated as needed: 
                  Local Limits 

                   
                  These local limits apply to the user's discharge to the city's sewerage system. 
                  (f)  Conditions for special agreements. No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, as long as no federal, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements are violated. 
                  (g)  Pretreatment requirements. Industrial users shall design, construct, operate, and maintain wastewater pretreatment facilities at their own expense whenever necessary to achieve compliance with the limitations in wastewater strength set forth in subsection (e) of this section, to meet applicable categorical standards, or to meet any other wastewater condition or limitation contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit. These pretreatment facilities shall be maintained in proper working condition at all times and at the expense of the industrial user. The city may also require the installation of a suitable flow equalization system, acid or base neutralization, and/or an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
                  (h)  Plans and specifications. Plans, specifications, and operating procedures for such wastewater pretreatment facilities shall be submitted to the city for review in accordance with accepted engineering practices. The city shall review said plans within 90 days and shall notify the user of any required changes. Upon final review, but prior to beginning construction of said pretreatment facility, the user shall secure such building, plumbing, or other permits that may be required by the city. The user shall then construct said pretreatment facility within the time provided in the user's wastewater discharge permit. Following completion of construction, the user shall provide the city with "as-built" drawings both in hard copy format, as well as in digital format (.dwg or .dxf files which can be read with ACADr14 or newer software). Review of any type, kind, or capacity of a pretreatment installation shall not relieve a user of full responsibility for the facility. No agreement as to limits of constituents or volumes of waters or wastes shall be considered as final approval for continuing operation. These limits will be subject to constant study and revised as necessary to serve their intended purpose. 
                  (i)  Accidental discharges and slugs. All industrial users shall comply with 40 CFR part 403.8(f)(2)(v) which stipulates the following: 
                  (1)  Randomly sample and analyze the effluent from industrial users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with pretreatment standards. 
                  (2)  Inspect and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least once a year. 
                  (3)  Evaluate, at least once every two years, whether each such significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges. For purposes of this subsection, a slug discharge is any discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature, including, but not limited to, an accidental spill or a non-customary batch discharge. 
                  (4)  The results of such activities shall be available to the approval authority upon request. If the POTW decides that a slug control plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements: 
                  a.  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
                  b.  Description of stored chemicals; 
                  c.  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days; 
                  d.  If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
                  (j)  Rates for water and sewer service. The rates for water and sewer service are set by the city and are subject to change from time to time. In addition, the city may assess a separate fee to industrial users for costs incurred by the city and related to the pretreatment requirements stated in this article. This section is not intended to modify the city's current practice of assessing sewer rates and fees, nor is it intended to modify section 30-54. Assessments for costs incurred by city shall be documented by appropriate accounting and audits. Assessments shall not exceed the actual costs incurred. 
                  (k)  Waiver of requirements . There shall be no provision for the granting of variances for discharge of incompatible wastes. If a user begins to violate any of the provisions of this section, it shall be his responsibility to apply to the superintendent who can issue a temporary permit along with a compliance schedule for planning and construction of the necessary treatment or pretreatment works. Each case will be carefully evaluated with respect to its effect on the wastewater treatment system and the environment prior to issuance of a temporary permit and compliance schedule. Any dilution of the wastewater by the user for the purpose of decreasing the concentrations of toxic materials shall be considered as a violation of this article.

For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the users long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with this article. 
                  (e)  Periodic compliance reports. 
                  (1)  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the city, but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with this article. 
                  (2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the users discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
                  (3)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the city, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (k) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
                  Note: City may, at its option, sample and analyze user discharges in lieu of requiring the users to conduct sampling and analysis. The user shall pay all costs associated with city sampling. 
                  (f)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the city of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system, which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change. 
                  (1)  The city may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under this article. 
                  (2)  The city may issue a wastewater discharge permit under this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
                  (3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of ten percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
                  (g)  Reports of potential problems. 
                  (1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
                  (2)  The city may require the user to submit a detailed written report within five days following such discharge describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of responsibility for any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of responsibility for any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article or other applicable law. 
                  (3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (g)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
                  (h)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as it may require. 
                  (i)  Notice of violation and repeat sampling and reporting . If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the city monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
                  (j)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
                  (1)  No hazardous waste that would cause interference or pass through shall be discharged into the POTW. Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (f) of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of this section. 
                  (2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (j)(1) of this section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (3)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 30 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  (4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the lowest level which has been reasonably determined to be economically practical. 
                  (5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
                  (k)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed at the user's expense in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
                  (l)  Sample collection. 
                  (1)  Except as indicated in subsection (l)(2) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the city may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
                  (2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
                  (m)  Timing . Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
                  (n)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years and shall be available for city inspection at any reasonable time. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city. 
                  (Code 2003, § 21-108) 
                  Sec. 30-95. - Inspections, monitoring and entry. 
                  (a)  Right of entry. The city, through any of its authorized employees: 
                  (1)  Shall have a right of entry to all parts of each user's facilities; and 
                  (2)  Shall have access to and may copy any records pertaining to the wastewater, and discharge, and may inspect any monitoring equipment or method and sample any effluent. All user records are subject to public disclosure, except where otherwise provided by law, including 40 CFR § 403.14. Furthermore, information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the city's inspection and sampling activities, shall otherwise be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods or production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. No user may deny the city the right of entry upon the user's premises, for purposes of inspection, sampling or performing such other duties as authorized by this article. City representatives shall follow all reasonable safety rules. Users with security procedures requiring proper identification may require city representatives to show identification prior to inspections and monitoring, as long as this does not cause undue delay. The city may permanently install sampling devices on the user's premises. Denial of access shall be cause for application for a search warrant. 
                  (b)  User operation of monitoring facilities. The user shall provide and operate, at its own expense, monitoring facilities to provide sampling, and flow measurement of the user's discharge to the POTW. The location and equipment used for these monitoring facilities must be approved by the city prior to installation. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be maintained in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed in accordance with a schedule approved by the city. 
                  (c)  Observance of safety rules. All construction and operation performed pursuant to this article shall be done in compliance with all applicable safety rules, regulations, ordinances and statutes. 
                  (d)  Inspections where city holds easement. Duly authorized employees of the city shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which the city holds an easement for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the sewerage works lying within the easement. 
                  (e)  Inspections, general. Duly authorized employees of the city shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
                  (f)  Safety . While performing inspections and monitoring, the city shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the owner. 
                  (Code 2003, § 21-109) 
                  Sec. 30-96. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
                  The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users, which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean: 
                  (1)  Chronic violation of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
                  (2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
                  (3)  Any other discharge violation that the city believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
                  (4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
                  (5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
                  (6)  Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
                  (7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
                  (8)  Any other violation(s), which the city determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
                  (Code 2003, § 21-110) 
                  Sec. 30-97. - Enforcement and abatement. 
                  (a)  Notice of violation. Whenever the city determines that a discharge of wastewater has occurred in violation of this article, the user's wastewater discharge permit, or any other applicable law or regulation, he shall notify the user in writing of such violation. Within 15 days of notification, the user will submit a report explaining the violation and a plan for correcting the violations. If the plan is acceptable, the city may require the user to sign an agreement incorporating the plan. Submittal and/or acceptance of the plan does not relieve the user of liability for the violations. 
                  (b)  Show cause hearing. The director may issue a notice directing a user to appear before the city council, at a specified place, date, and time to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken in response to a violation of this article, other applicable law and regulation, or conditions in the user's wastewater discharge permit. The notice shall be served by certified mail at least ten days prior to the hearing. The city council or city manager shall conduct the hearing and take the evidence. The user shall be entitled to present evidence and examine witnesses. After the city council or city manager has reviewed the evidence, the city may punish any violation, as authorized under section 30-98. 
                  (c)  Compliance orders. Upon finding a user has violated this article or the users permit, city may order compliance within a certain time. Failure to comply within said time may result in discontinuance of service. Compliance orders may contain other requirements to ensure compliance, including self-monitoring and modified waste management practices. A compliance order shall not relieve the user of liability or preclude other action. 
                  (d)  Consent orders . The city may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar document establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (c) and (f) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
                  (e)  Damages and injunctive relief. When a discharge of waste causes an obstruction, damage, or any other impairment to the city facilities, the user causing said discharge shall be liable for and shall reimburse the city for any and all expenses resulting therefrom. The city may file an action in any appropriate court of Greene County, Georgia to recover such damages. The city may file in the Superior Court of Greene County, Georgia, a suit seeking an injunction, or other appropriate equitable relief, to enforce the provisions of this article. 
                  (f)  Emergency termination of service . In the event of an actual or threatened discharge to the POTW of any pollutant which reasonably presents or may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, or cause interference with the POTW, the city shall immediately notify the industrial user or other person causing the emergency and request abatement of the actual or threatened discharge. The city may, after reasonable attempts to achieve the above described notice and abatement, temporarily terminate the water and sewer service of such user or users as reasonably necessary to abate the condition. Such service shall be restored by the city as soon as the emergency situation has been abated. No hearing is required prior to the emergency termination of service. 
                  (g)  Damaging facilities. No person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or equipment which is a part of the sewerage work. Any person violating this provision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
                  (h)  Affirmative defense of upset. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (h)(3) of this section, are met. 
                  (3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
                  b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
                  c.  The user has submitted the following information to the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
                  1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (6)  When experiencing problems with a treatment facility, users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced or lost. 
                  (i)  Affirmative defense of prohibited discharge standards. The user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 30-92(c) or the specific prohibitions of section 30-92(d) and (e) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  (1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
                  (2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge with the city was regularly in compliance with NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. Pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(a)(2), the affirmative defense outlined herein cannot apply to the specific prohibitions in sections 30-92(d) and (e). 
                  (j)  Affirmative defense of bypass. 
                  (1)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities, which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. The term "severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (j)(3) and (4) of this section. 
                  (3)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times; and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (4)  Bypass is prohibited and the city may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  a.  Bypass was required to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
                  c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (j)(3) of this section. 
                  (5)  The city may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (j)(4) of this section.

                  Sec. 30-98. - Penalties for violations. 
                  (a)  Civil penalties assessed by city court. 
                  (1)  A violator of this article or a permit or order issued hereunder shall be liable to the city for a penalty up to $1,000.00 per violation, per day. For weekly, monthly or other long-term average discharge limit violations, penalties accrue for each day of such period of violation. 
                  (2)  In determining the penalty, the city court shall consider all relevant facts, including the extent of harm due to the violation, the magnitude and duration, economic benefit to the user, corrective actions, and compliance history. 
                  (3)  The city may recover reasonable attorneys fees, damages, court costs and other enforcement expenses associated with the enforcement activities, should the court determine violations did occur. Appeals from city court decisions may be had in the Greene County Superior Court upon the filing of an appeal within 30 days of the decision. 
                  (4)  An action for civil penalties shall not preclude other enforcement action. 
                  (b)  Criminal prosecution in city court. Any user who has intentionally violated any provision of these regulations, or who shall continue any violation (intentional or otherwise) after written notice of the violation provided, or who shall falsify records, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor upon conviction of said offense. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense. Any person, firm or corporation convicted of violating the provisions of this article shall be fined up to $1,000.00 per day, per violation, and shall further reimburse the city for all expense, loss and damage incurred by the city due to such violation. Conviction may additionally be punished by up to six months incarceration. Appeal from city court decisions may be had as allowed by law. The Clerk of the Greensboro City Court shall issue summons to persons violating these regulations, returnable to the city court for trial.

                  Sec. 30-99. - High strength wastewater surcharge. 
                  (a)  Definition . All users discharging "high strength" wastewater into the City of Greensboro Sewer System shall be assessed a monetary surcharge, in addition of the normally required sewer use charges, in an amount to be calculated as shown below. A "high strength" wastewater is defined as wastewater which contains the below shown parameters in excess of the below shown concentrations: 
                  (1)  BOD5 of 275 milligrams per liter (mg/l). 
                  (2)  Total suspended solids (TSS) of 275 mg/l. 
                  (3)  Total ammonia nitrogen (NH3 + NH4) of 20 mg/l. 
                  (4)  Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) of 30 mg/l. 
                  (5)  Total phosphorus of 7 mg/l. 
                  (6)  Floatable oil and grease of 100 mg/l. 
                  (b)  Surcharge. The amount of the surcharge, which is hereby charged and assessed against all users discharging high strength wastewater into the City of Greensboro Sewer System, shall, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-60-2, reflect the cost incurred by the city in handling the excess BOD, TSS, ammonia, TKN, total phosphorus and floatable oil and grease. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the wastewater treatment facilities, including depreciation and other incidental expenses. The surcharge will be collected pursuant to monthly billing separate from the monthly water bill. The surcharge shall not exceed the actual costs incurred by city, and shall be documented by appropriate accounting and audits. 
                  (c)  Formula . When the concentrations of the surcharged parameters shown above exceed the values of the constituents as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the excess concentrations shall be subject to a surcharge in the amount derived in accordance with the following formula: 
                  P x (G-R) x 8.34 X C = $/month 
                  Where: 
                  "P" is equal to the percentage concentration in mg/l of the parameter being evaluated (BOD, TSS, ammonia, TKN, total phosphorus, or floatable oil and grease) which is in excess of the amounts shown in subsection (a) of this section. Determination of "P" shall be based on the most accurate information available. 
                  "G" is equal to the users' monthly water consumption in millions of gallons as determined from the user's monthly water meter readings. 
                  "R" is equal to the quantity of water in millions of gallons per month, which is retained by the user, or that portion of water consumption which goes into the manufactured product or its production by-products, or is otherwise disposed of by means other into the city wastewater system. 
                  "8.34" is a conversion factor. 
                  "C" is equal to the unit cost in dollars per pound for the treatment of the surcharged parameters. This value shall be established by the city based on actual wastewater treatment costs, which shall be revised from time to time as necessary and shall be documented by appropriate accounting and audits. The wastewater quantity may be determined through installation of a wastewater flowmeter approved by the city in lieu of determining wastewater flow based on metered water. The city shall retain documentation setting forth the surcharge calculations, and such documentation may be inspected by the users. 
                  (d)  Quantitative measurement of parameters. The measurement of the surcharge parameters-BOD, TSS, ammonia, TKN, total phosphorus, and floatable oil and grease) shall be conducted as follows: 
                  (1)  The city shall sample and test the user once per year as required. The sampling to determine surcharge shall be at least three sampling events during a period of not less than 14 calendar days. The cost of such sampling shall be paid for by the user. 
                  (2)  The city need not provide any prior notice to the user with regard to the sampling period. 
                  (3)  The city may sample the user as often as desired at the city's expense if, in the opinion of the city, representative samples have not been previously obtained. 
                  (4)  If in the opinion of the user, the samples taken by the city are not representative of the user's typical wastewater, then the user may request a re-sampling. The cost and scheduling of such re-sampling shall be paid for by the requesting user.

                  Sec. 30-100. - Procedure for users to establish credit against wastewater service charges. 
                  Any industrial, commercial, or institutional user of the City of Greensboro Wastewater System will not be required to pay wastewater service charges for metered water which the customer does not return to the sewer, provided that the user installs a flow meter on the effluent sewer line. The influent and effluent flows will be compared for credit approval provided the following conditions are satisfied: 
                  (1)  All meters must be approved by the city. 
                  (2)  The user shall pay the engineer's and installation fees. 
                  (3)  The City of Greensboro reserves the right to inspect meters monthly. 
                  (4)  All meters must be calibrated annually.

                  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH Zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
                  Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in section 105-4. 
                  Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
                  Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for Zones AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1-V30, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year.

                  Building means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage. 
                  Critical facility means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. The term "critical facility" includes: 
                  (1)  Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic, or water-reactive materials; 
                  (2)  Hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events; 
                  (3)  Emergency operation centers or data storage centers which contain records or services that may become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events; and 
                  (4)  Generating plants, and other principal points of utility lines. 
                  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and storage of materials or equipment. 
                  Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before August 27, 1982. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 27, 1982. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or

                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as Zone A. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Flood insurance study means the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after August 27, 1982, (the effective date of the initial FIRM) and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced after August 27, 1982, (the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community) and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after August 27, 1982. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis;

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement. 
                  (1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. The market value of the structure should be: 
                  a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  (2)  The term "substantial improvement" includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  (3)  The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
                  a.  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
                  (Code 2003, § 34-106; Ord. No. 2010-3, § 34-106, 9-7-2010) 
                  Sec. 105-2. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
                  (a)  Authorization. Article IX, section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. 
                  (b)  Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of Greensboro, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (d)  Objectives . The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Sec. 105-4. - Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
                  The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated December 17, 2010, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this chapter. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS dated December 17, 2010, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, for Greene County are hereby adopted by reference. Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. The repository for public inspection of the flood insurance study (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting data is located at the City of Greensboro's Office of Planning and Development.

                  Sec. 105-9. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
                  The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Greensboro or by any officer, employee, or agents, thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

                  Sec. 105-42. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The city council as established by the City of Greensboro shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city planner in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Greene County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The city planner shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (5)  The owner shall execute a hold harmless form which releases the officers, employees, and agents of the City of Greensboro from any and all claims associated with the issuance of a variance. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 105-75(4), elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above two feet above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to two feet above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 105-41(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved: 
                  1.  On individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation; and 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a and c of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 105-4, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

Intention to take an appeal to the Greensboro City Council shall be filed with the Greensboro City Manager in writing within three business days following the denial on the permit. In acting on an appeal, the Greensboro City Council may affirm, reverse, wholly or partly, the decision or determination of the Greensboro Historic Preservation Commission, and to that end shall have all of the powers of the zoning administrative officer and building official and may issue or direct the issuance of a sign permit. A reversal of the commission's decision shall only be done by the governing body, in cases where it is determined that the commission either abused its discretion in reaching its decision, or it erred in the interpretation of the provisions of this article. Written notification of any such action shall be provided to the applicant and the Greensboro Historic Preservation Commission. 
                  (g)  Variances. The Greensboro Historic Preservation is authorized to consider applications for variances to the provisions of this article. The procedure for filing a variance application shall be the same as for variances to the zoning ordinance in the B-3 district. Variance applications shall be judged based on the criteria for variances to the zoning ordinance, as provided in the Greensboro zoning ordinance. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-802) 
                  Sec. 107-36. - Sign types. 
                  (a)  Types of signs allowed. The following types of signs are allowed subject to the Greensboro Historic Preservation Commission review and approval based upon the regulations set forth in this article: 
                  (1)  Freestanding signs. 
                  a.  Height limit. Freestanding signs are limited to low profile signs which may not exceed a height of five feet on a monument sign and eight feet on a single pole sign. 
                  b.  Design . Freestanding monument signs with solid or enclosed bases are permitted where approved. Signs supported by at least two poles without enclosed bases are also permitted, provided that the exposed pole's height does not constitute more than 50 percent of the overall height (i.e., the height of the open area beneath a sign cannot exceed 50 percent of the sign's total height). Single pole signs are not considered appropriate in the Historic Commercial District except in the case where a single pole is used in conjunction with a horizontal cross-bar to support hanging signs on one side of the pole only subject to the projection and clearance provisions defined in section 107-37(9). 
                  c.  Size. Freestanding signs shall be limited to a maximum of 16 square feet (four feet by four feet) in area, or 32 square feet for a double-faced sign. Single pole sign size is limited to nine square feet (three feet by three feet) area. 
                  d.  Density. Businesses, projects or parcels are limited to one freestanding sign except that properties with more than 100 feet of continuous frontage and with more than one entrance may, subject to Greensboro Historic Preservation Commission approval, install a freestanding sign at each entrance, provided that the combined square footage of all freestanding signs does not exceed 32 square feet, (two 16 square foot signs). Where there is frontage on more than one street, each frontage is treated independently provided that no two signs may be closer than 100 feet to one another. Signage area may not be transferred from one frontage to another. 
                  e.  Location and orientation. Freestanding signs are subject to the location requirements of the Greensboro Historic Preservation Commission. 
                  f.  Content. Because it is the city's intent to facilitate traffic flow and avoid traffic hazards caused by confusing or cluttered signage, and because tourists, who may be looking for a specific business name listed in the telephone directory or other promotional advertisements, freestanding signs with a commercial message are permitted for the purposes of identifying the name of the building or business only. Text can include street number. 
                  (2)  Window. Permanent window signs may be placed in or upon any window, provided that no more than ten percent of the total transparent area of the window or windows combined is obscured. 
                  (3)  Wall signs. Wall signs may be placed upon a building provided that they meet the size, material, content; location and other standards of this article. Wall signs shall be placed so as to utilize existing architectural features of a building without obscuring them. Wall signs shall be oriented toward pedestrians or vehicles within close proximity. 
                  (4)  Projecting signs . No single projecting sign may exceed 16 square feet in area or may project more than 36 inches from the face of the buildings to which it is attached. Projecting signs must have at least eight feet clearance, and cannot be higher than the building to which they are attached. Signs may extend over city property or state right-of-way only with the written approval of the Greensboro City Council. 
                  (5)  Hanging signs. A hanging sign may be attached to a building or placed underneath an approved canopy, awning, or colonnade, as long as it does not project beyond the same and is parallel to the building. It must have at least eight feet of ground clearance. Signs may extend over city property or state right-of-way only with the written approval of the Greensboro City Council. 
                  (6)  Awnings. Awnings are permitted as signage provided they blend with the architecture of the building and do not obscure details of the building. Awnings should serve as an accent to the building's design but should not be the dominant architectural feature. Awnings are counted as signage if they have lettering or other graphics conveying a commercial message or name of a business or product sold in the building to which the awning is attached. 
                  (7)  Signage area. Only 20 percent of any one face of an awning may be used for signage regardless of the size of the building facade to which the sign applies. 
                  a.  Material. Canvas or metal shed awnings are permitted. Material should be high quality, colorfast and sun/fade resistant. Vinyl or plastic materials are not considered appropriate. 
                  b.  Color. Awning colors are generally limited to a single field color with a single contrasting color for lettering and may be used only if they conform to color requirements as specified in section 107-37(5). 
                  c.  Illumination. Illuminated (back-lit) translucent awnings or translucent letters on opaque backgrounds are not appropriate and are not permitted. Canvas or metal awnings illuminated in the traditional manner with incandescent lighting are permitted. 
                  d.  Clearance and projection. Clearance and projection awnings must have a minimum of eight feet clearance from the ground to the frame or valance. 
                  e.  Location of awnings. Awnings must be located in a traditional manner above doors, and windows. All other locations are prohibited. 
                  (8)  Illuminated signs. Illuminated signs are permitted subject to the provisions of section 107-37(6). 
                  (9)  Neon signs. Neon signs are permitted by variance only. See section 107-35(g). 
                  (10)  Changeable copy signs. Changeable copy signs may only be used in conjunction with theaters, entertainment facilities, non-profit art galleries, or similar exhibit facilities permitted in the Historic Commercial District. 
                  (11)  Directory signs. Directory signs shall be permitted to provide information for multi-tenant projects. Multi-tenant projects may have a maximum of 32 square feet of signage area to serve as a directory for the project. The contents of such signs shall be limited to the name of the tenants of the project, address or suite number, and telephone numbers. Signs shall be located in the common area of the project and oriented toward a central pedestrian path or common parking area. No rental information, or sales information shall be permitted on the directory sign. A directory sign does not constitute a primary or secondary sign. 
                  (12)  Menu display. Menus for restaurants may be displayed on the inside of windows of a restaurant or inside a wall-mounted box. The maximum size shall be three square feet. If a display box is used, it must be constructed to coordinate with the building design, must contain a clear face which would protect the menu from the weather and must not extend over public property. Chalk or erasable boards are exempt from a clear face coverage. A menu display does not constitute a primary or secondary sign. If any information other than the menu is incorporated into the menu display, then this would constitute a primary or secondary sign. 
                  (13)  Special purpose signs. Signs and banners promoting events sponsored by civic, charitable, educational, or other nonprofit organizations may be erected on private property up to four weeks in advance of the event being promoted. These signs shall be removed within five days following the conclusion of the event. Signs or banners located on or over public property easements or right-of-way are subject to the requirements of this article and require approval by the building inspector. 
                  (14)  Temporary signs. Temporary signs are permitted subject to the requirements of section 107-38. 
                  (15)  Sandwich boards. Sandwich boards are permitted provided they are no larger than six square feet, or two feet by three feet per side. They must be portable made of wooden or metal material, and removed from the sidewalk daily at the close of business. Only one per store front is allowed and placement is to ensure safe passage by shoppers. Coloring must be in keeping with the standards of this article. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-803) 
                  Sec. 107-37. - Design and location standards. 
                  All regulated signs must comply with the following design standards: 
                  (1)  Size requirements. The total area of all permanent signs, including but not limited to freestanding signs, window signs, wall signs, projecting signs, and hanging signs, shall not exceed 32 square feet per business. There shall be no more than one primary, and one secondary sign per business. A secondary sign is one that is smaller than the primary sign. 
                  (2)  Area of sign. The area of a sign shall include the entire area within any type of perimeter or border which may enclose the outer limits of any writing, representation, emblem, figure, or character. The area of the sign having no perimeter or border shall be computed by enclosing the entire area within a parallelogram, circle, or triangle of the smallest size sufficient to cover the entire area of the sign and computing the area of that parallelogram, circle, or triangle. The area of the second side of a two-sided sign shall be included when calculating signage area. Where a sign has more than two faces, the total area of the third face and all additional faces shall be included in determining the area of the sign. 
                  (3)  Signage plans. Buildings or clusters of buildings having more than one tenant or use, shall provide a signage plan for the entire structure or project to be reviewed and approved by the historic preservation commission prior to erection of any sign. The signage plan must be designed so that it establishes a common theme or design, uses similar construction methods, has compatible colors, lettering, lettering style, symbols, scale and size of signs and/or identical background. Signage plans for office buildings must have their primary focus on the identification of the building, and individual tenants may be identified by using small lettering on a window or door or directories. Total signage area within the plan is subject to the maximum size limitation of this article. Signage area cannot be transferred to a single building or facade from other buildings in the project. 
                  (4)  Sign materials. Exposed surfaces of signs may be constructed of metal, glass, stone, concrete, brick, cloth, wood or sand blasted wood. 
                  (5)  Color. Signs must be finished in subdued earth tone color. Earth tones may be deemed in this context to include the full spectrum of soil and clay colors. Spectrums of off-whites to deep browns, and light grays to black provide a wide range of acceptable colors. Brighter colors may be used, provided they are imbued with brown or black tones. For example: pink imbued with brown would tend toward mauve and would be acceptable. Bright reds imbued with brown or black tones give a deeper burgundy or maroon color and may also be acceptable. Colors should compliment the color scheme of the building. In no case will day-glo, fluorescent, reflective colored materials that give the appearance of changing color or brilliant luminescent colors be permitted. 
                  (6)  Illumination. 
                  a.  Externally illuminated signs. Light fixtures for externally illuminated signs must be simple in form and mounted so they do not obscure building ornamentation. The light fixtures should emphasize the continuity of the building surface and should not clutter the building in an unorganized manner. Spot lights and flood lights shall be directed only at the sign surface. Sign lighting should not conflict with traffic signals. Light shall not be directed off the property. No exposed light sources are allowed, and all light sources must be shaded to contain light rays to the sign. Colored lighting is prohibited. 
                  b.  Internally illuminated signs. This type of sign is not considered appropriate in the Historical Commercial District and is prohibited. 
                  (7)  Period correct . Only type styles in use in the United States between 1830 and 1910 may be accepted. 
                  (8)  Location on building. Architectural details of a building often suggest a location, size, or shape for a sign. Signage should compliment the architectural details of the building. Signs should help to establish a visual continuity with adjacent store fronts and relate directly to the store entrance. Signs must be oriented toward pedestrians or vehicles in close proximity. Signs shall be designed and located on the building or on the premises in a manner that is compatible with the mass and scale of the building to which the sign applies. Signs must not obscure architectural details of the building; nor cover doors, windows, or other integral elements of the facade. Signs shall not obstruct view of nearby intersections and driveways. 
                  (9)  Projections and clearance. No sign may project more than 36 inches from the face of a building or pole. Projecting and hanging signs must maintain at least eight feet of clearance from ground level. Signs may extend over city property only with the written approval of the Greensboro City Council. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-804) 
                  Sec. 107-38. - Temporary signage. 
                  (a)  Policy. It is the policy of the city as outlined in this section to restrict the use of temporary signage. Temporary signage is often poorly constructed, poorly maintained, and located in a manner that obscures traffic signs, views of intersections of public and private streets and driveways and tends to depreciate the scenic beauty and quality of life of the community by creating visual clutter. Temporary signage has a place in the community for specialized purposes, such as announcing properties for sale or lease, construction activities, temporary sales, or making political or ideological statements. Temporary signage is permitted for those and similar purposes subject to the regulations of this section. 
                  (b)  Temporary signs. Temporary signs are those signs which are installed with the intent of displaying them continuously for more than 24 hours, but which are not related to a permanent land use on the property, and are not intended to be displayed for more than 30 days. Temporary signs include signs announcing properties for sale, lease or rent, and campaign signs and other similar signs of a non-commercial nature. Temporary signs are permitted subject to the following regulations on placement and location: 
                  (1)  Size. Temporary signs shall not exceed three square feet of area on the exposed sign face. 
                  (2)  Location. Temporary signs are permitted, provided that they are located a minimum of 20 feet back from the edge of the curb, or edge of pavement where there is no curb, of the street on which the sign fronts. If this 20-foot distance would be within a structure, the sign may be within three feet of the front of the structure. Signs must be parallel to the street on which the building fronts, and placed in front of the front facade with the building as a backdrop. Signs may be positioned in the side yard. Signs may be displayed through windows or other glass areas. On vacant lots, where there is no structure, the sign shall be approximately centered on the lot and shall maintain the 20-foot setback from the edge of the curb or edge of pavement where there is no curb. 
                  (3)  Height. No portion of the sign shall extend more than five feet above the existing ground level at the location of the sign. Mounting devices may extend above the sign by not more than six inches. 
                  (4)  Number. Only one temporary sign is permitted on any one parcel of property. 
                  (5)  Mounting devices. Temporary signs shall be mounted on hardware of wood or painted metal, and no part of the mounting structure shall be greater than four inches by four inches in cross section. Mounting hardware shall be painted or stained in earth tones. No message may be written on the mounting hardware, so that the entire message area of the sign is contained on the sign face itself. 
                  (6)  Lighting prohibited. No temporary sign may be illuminated in any manner. 
                  (7)  Color and materials. Temporary signs are subject to the design standards of section 107-37. 
                  (8)  Maintenance. Temporary signs shall be maintained as provided in section 107-42, and it shall be a violation of this article to permit a temporary sign to fall into disrepair. 
                  (9)  Exceptions. Where there are conditions such as heavy vegetation on the property, or extremely steep terrain that makes the sign placement standards of this section impractical because the sign is not visible from the street, the Greensboro Historical Preservation Commission may grant an exception of the sign setback standards, but not the size or street orientation standards. In no event may temporary signs subject to the setback requirements be placed within the public right-of-way. 
                  (c)  Banners over public property. 
                  (1)  Approval. All applications to display banners over public property shall be approved as outlined later in this section. 
                  (2)  Terms and conditions. In order to receive approval to display a sign or banner over public property the applicant shall meet the following terms and conditions: 
                  a.  The banner or sign shall only inform the community of an upcoming community event. A community event shall be defined as a public event which is of interest to the community as a whole rather than the promotion of any product, political candidate, religious leader or commercial goods or services. 
                  b.  The banner may only be displayed immediately prior to and during a community event which it advertises, and in no case shall the banner be displayed for more than 30 days or more than ten days after the event. 
                  c.  Banners shall only be displayed at site(s) approved by the historic preservation commission. 
                  d.  Reservation of dates for a banner site may be made up to three months prior to the date of display. Site(s) are generally reserved on a first-come, first-served basis; however, preference may be given for recurring annual events, historically or traditionally tied to a specific date, holiday or season. Additionally, a request to advertise the reoccurrence of the same event or same type of event within any one calendar year (i.e., plays or class registrations) may be honored if no request for the banner site for an unrepeated scheduling is received. 
                  e.  All banners crossing over public thoroughfares shall be hung by city personnel, and must meet the following specifications: 
                  1.  Maximum banner dimensions over public property shall not exceed four feet by 30 feet. 
                  2.  Day-glo, or fluorescent colors shall not be allowed. 
                  3.  Banners shall be constructed of durable canvas or similar type weather-resistant material. 
                  4.  Banners must be slit to reduce wind resistance. 
                  5.  Banners must be reinforced with rope within a casing at the bottom of the banner edge. 
                  6.  Each corner of the banner must have a grommet and a lead of one-quarter-inch rope from each corner no less than four feet long. 
                  7.  Banners must have a minimum of seven grommets (including the two corner grommets) across the top edge, which allows the banner to be attached to a cable. 
                  8.  An additional 150 feet of one-quarter inch rope is required to hang each banner, and shall be provided to the city by the applicant or sponsor of the banner. 
                  f.  The primary purpose of banners which extend over public property shall be to advertise and conform of upcoming community events. No more than five percent of each side of the banner space shall be used for the name or logo of a commercial sponsor. 
                  g.  Prices or fees charged for the event shall not be displayed. 
                  h.  Banners shall be hung or displayed in a manner that does not interfere with or impede traffic or interfere with or obscure traffic signs or control devices. 
                  i.  The owner of a banner shall agree to assume full liability and indemnify the city for any damage to persons or property arising from the display of the banner by the city. 
                  j.  If the banner is not picked up from the city by the applicant or sponsor within ten days after it has been taken down, the banner shall become the property of the city and will be disposed of. 
                  k.  Banners should be received by the city one week prior to the date of scheduled display. The city is not responsible for any damage that may occur to the banner from any cause. 
                  (3)  Fee . A fee shall be payable to the city when the banner is dropped off at the city before its reservation commences to cover manpower costs associated with installation and removal of the banner. Said fee shall be set by resolution by city council. 
                  (d)  Banners on city light standards. 
                  (1)  Administration. The historic preservation commission is authorized to administer the placement of banners on city light standards. 
                  (2)  Approval. Approval of all applications to display banners on city light standards shall be given by the historic preservation commission only if all conditions in this article are met. 
                  (3)  Terms and conditions. Banners displayed in the city area shall be either those sponsored by, designed for and commissioned by, fabricated for, and installed by the direction of the historic preservation commission, or those sponsored by outside entities (sponsors) that meet the following terms and conditions: 
                  a.  The eligible sponsor must be a non-commercial, profit, non-profit entity whose primary purpose is the offering of cultural, educational, or entertainment enrichment to the community. 
                  b.  The design of banners must be presented to the historic preservation commission for review and approval. Art work should be of sufficient size and show actual colors and banners material in sufficient detail to adequately represent the proposed final product. 
                  c.  The cost of the design and fabrication of the banners is to be borne by the sponsor. Cost of installation and dismantling will be borne by the organization sponsoring the banners. 
                  d.  Applications shall be presented to the historic preservation commission in sufficient time to allow the determination of eligibility of the sponsor, design review, fabrication of the banners and verification of the scheduling of their period of display. 
                  e.  Sponsors accept that the display period is contingent upon a workable arrangement within the overall schedule of other city banners as well as other commitments to outside sponsors. 
                  f.  Prior commitments may preclude the desired display period of an otherwise acceptable sponsor's banner. The historic preservation commission acknowledges that a sponsors interest and ability to participate may be contingent upon a minimum period which would warrant the expense of fabrication of the banners. The display period will be on a first-come basis. 
                  (4)  Installation; specifications. All banners on city light standards shall be hung by city personnel and must meet the following specifications: 
                  a.  Fabrication, design, and colors are to be approved by the Greensboro Historic Preservation Commission. 
                  b.  The dates for the banners to be installed and dismantled will be arranged by the sponsor and the historic preservation commission. 
                  c.  Fabric must be of durable material to withstand heavy winds. 
                  d.  Sponsors will pay for art work, banner production, installation and dismantling of banners. 
                  e.  A permit shall be obtained from the building inspector. 
                  f.  The owner of a banner shall agree to assume full liability and indemnify the city for any damage to persons or property arising from the display of the banner by the city. 
                  g.  If the banner is not picked up from the city by the applicant or sponsor within ten days after it has been taken down, the banner shall become the property of the city and will be disposed of. 
                  h.  Banners should be received by the city one week prior to the date of scheduled display. 
                  i.  The city is not responsible for any damage that may occur to the banner from any cause. 
                  (5)  Banners on private property. Banners identifying a specific commercial event or sale, and not identifying a particular business shall be subject to the following restrictions: One banner per premise, limited to on-site (i.e., the information on the banner must relate only to the business premises upon which the banner is displayed) banners only, permitted for no more than ten consecutive calendar days, per any given 120 calendar day period, and banner shall not exceed 35 square feet in area. Review and approval is required by the historic preservation commission prior to the issuance of a permit or for display of said banner, and said banner shall be allowed only for one ten-day period within a calendar year. The permit and identifying expiration date shall be displayed in a prominent place. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-805) 
                  Sec. 107-39. - Non-regulated signs. 
                  (a)  Signs exempt from permit requirement. The following signs are not subject to a permit requirement and review/approval by the historic preservation commission if the following standards are met. They shall be regulated by the following size and placement standards, block lettering and coloration in accordance with section 107-37(5) and shall not be included when calculating permitted sign area for any parcel, use or development. 
                  (1)  Solicitation signs. One "no solicitors" sign, not to exceed one-half square foot, is allowed per major entrance to any building or apartment complex. 
                  (2)  Hours of operation sign. One "hours of operation" sign is allowed per entryway. Each sign may not exceed one square foot in area. The sign may not be illuminated. 
                  (3)  Trespassing and security signs. "No trespassing" and security signs may be posted on doors, windows or other property entrances, or on fences or property lines. They may not exceed one square foot in area, and may not be illuminated. 
                  (4)  Addressing numbers. Addressing numbers may be no higher than four inches. When placed on commercial buildings, they may be taken into account in the review of the signage plan. 
                  (5)  Flags, symbols, or insignias. The flag of the United States, the State of Georgia, or other flags or insignias of governmental entities or agencies may be displayed and not counted as signage. 
                  (6)  Special sale signs. Merchants may advertise special sales with temporary signs on the inside of windows, provided they do not cover more than 33 percent of the window area. (Special sale signs may be displayed two weeks at a time, five times a year.) 
                  (7)  Public necessity signs. Public necessity signs such as rest rooms; no parking and street name signs installed by or with permission of the city are exempt from permit requirements.

                  Sec. 111-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (c)(16) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit, and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (b)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table yearround; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant the Metropolitan River Protection Act shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.) shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit.

                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Greensboro without first obtaining a permit from the planning, building, and safety department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to the EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the planning, building, and safety department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 111-4(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by ten copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 111-4(c)(15) and (c)(16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained.

                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 115-1. - Purposes. 
                  This chapter is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the City of Greensboro, Georgia, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the City of Greensboro, Georgia, so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the City of Greensboro, Georgia, as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this chapter shall: 
                  (1)  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the City of Greensboro, Georgia; 
                  (2)  Protect the City of Greensboro, Georgia's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities; 
                  (3)  Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
                  (4)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennas failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas; 
                  (5)  Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; 
                  (6)  Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and 
                  (7)  Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-401) 
                  Sec. 115-2. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Antenna means any exterior apparatus designed for the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves for telephonic, radio, television, personal wireless services, or other communications transmission. For the purposes of this chapter the term "antenna" does not include any tower and antenna under 70 feet in total height which is owned and operated by an amateur radio operator licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, any device designed for over-the-air reception of radio or television broadcast signals, multichannel multi-point distribution service or direct broadcast satellite service, or any cable television headend or hub towers and antennas used solely for cable television services. 
                  Director means the county planning and zoning board or their designee. 
                  Governing body means the City Council for the City of Greensboro, Georgia. 
                  Macro telecommunications facilities means those which are located on existing buildings, poles or other existing support structures and which project more than three feet above the top of the structure but no more than ten feet above the roofline, parapet or top of the structure. Macro telecommunication facilities may exceed the height limitation specified for the zoning district. 
                  Micro telecommunications facilities means those which are located on existing buildings, poles or other existing support structures where antennas do not project more than three feet above the top of the structure and there are no more than six antennas per site. 
                  Monopole tower means a telecommunications tower consisting of a single pole, constructed without guy wires or ground anchors. 
                  Telecommunications facilities means antennas and towers, either individually or together. 
                  Tower means a structure, such as a lattice tower, guy tower, or monopole tower, constructed as a freestanding structure or in association with a building, other permanent structure or equipment, on which is located one or more antennas intended for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication. The term "tower" includes microwave towers, common carrier towers, and cellular telephone towers.

                  Sec. 115-3. - Exclusions. 
                  The following shall be exempt from this chapter: 
                  (1)  Any tower and antenna under 70 feet in total height which is owned and operated by an amateur radio operator licensed by the Federal Communications Commission; 
                  (2)  Any device designed for over-the-air reception of television broadcast signals, multichannel multi point distribution service or direct broadcast satellite service; 
                  (3)  Any telecommunications facilities located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the City of Greensboro, Georgia, provided a license or lease authorizing the telecommunications facility has been approved by the governing body; or 
                  (4)  Any cable television headend or hub towers and antennas used solely for cable television services. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-403) 
                  Sec. 115-4. - Placement of telecommunications facilities by zoning district. 
                  (a)  In industrial (I) zoning districts, micro and macro telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use by right. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least one user are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 80 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the director. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least two users are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 100 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the director. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least three users are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 120 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the director. 
                  (b)  In general business (B-1), highway oriented business (B-2), and agricultural (A) zoning districts, telecommunications facilities may be allowed following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the director, provided that such tower and antenna are set back at least a distance of the total tower height plus 1,500 feet in all directions from any single residence and from any or multiple family residential districts or historic districts or land marks as measured radially from the tower base to the district boundary, and provided that the design of the tower be compatible with the surrounding area. It is the intention of this requirement to make all towers as unobtrusive as possible. Therefore, alternative tower structures designed to camouflage with the surrounding area shall be preferred options. Monopole towers up to a height of 50 feet are permitted as a special use following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the director and monopole towers up to a height of 80 feet designed and intended to accommodate at least two users are permitted as a special use following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the director. 
                  (c)  In single-family residential (R-1), planned unit development (PUD), one- and two-family residential (R-2), multifamily residential (R-3), mobile home parks (R-4), historic districts or within a distance equal to the tower height plus 1,500 feet of such zoning boundary, telecommunications facilities shall be prohibited. 
                  (d)  Telecommunications facilities outside the guidelines listed above may only be built after approval of a variance in accordance with chapter 121, as well as receipt of a building permit. There shall be no variances of the prohibitions listed in this section. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-404) 
                  Sec. 115-5. - Preferred and disfavored location sites. 
                  (a)  Preferred location sites . 
                  (1)  Collocation sites . Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site, provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this chapter and collocation sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the director or the governing body to be visually obtrusive. 
                  (2)  Publicly-used structures . Publicly-used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly-used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly-used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, community centers, civic centers, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, and light poles. 
                  (3)  Industrial and commercial structures . Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility. 
                  (b)  Disfavored location sites . Any residential structure or site of any sort shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-405) 
                  Sec. 115-6. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities. 
                  (a)  General requirements for all telecommunications facilities . The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this chapter. 
                  (1)  Building codes and safety standard s. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the director. 
                  (2)  Regulatory compliance . 
                  a.  All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this chapter shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 
                  b.  Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  (3)  Security . All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. 
                  (4)  Lighting . No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  (5)  Advertising . No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this chapter are met. 
                  (6)  Visual impact. 
                  a.  Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background. 
                  c.  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. 
                  d.  Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  e.  Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
                  (7)  Landscaping . 
                  a.  Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property. 
                  b.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  c.  The director may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the director. 
                  (8)  Maintenance impacts . Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street. 
                  (9)  Principal, accessory and joint uses . 
                  a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility. 
                  b.  Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 
                  (10)  Lot size and setbacks . 
                  a.  The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities, provided however, that the director may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby, except no exception shall be allowed to the setback requirements for residential, historic or landmark areas. 
                  1.  Telecommunications towers and their guy wires and accessory facilities must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower plus 1,500 feet from any off-site residential structure. 
                  2.  Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
                  3.  Telecommunications facilities must be setback from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 115-7. 
                  b.  For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot-high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact. 
                  (b)  Additional requirements for towers . 
                  (1)  Site location and development shall preserve the pre-existing character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. 
                  (2)  Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 
                  (3)  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (4)  Towers shall not be located any closer than two miles from an existing tower. 
                  (5)  When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to its total height, plus 1,500 feet. 
                  (6)  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district. 
                  (7)  Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter. 
                  (8)  Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access.

               <p>
                  Sec. 119-1. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  The wetlands within the city are an indispensable and fragile natural resource with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
                  (b)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (c)  It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (d)  The purpose of this section is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this section is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
                  (Code 2003, ch. 39, art. 6, intro.) 
                  Sec. 119-2. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Functions means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quantity and quality and reduction of erosion; habit for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic and recreational amenities. 
                  Generalized wetland map means wetlands identified on the U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory Maps. 
                  Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
                  Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
                  Jurisdictional determination means an official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or, in the case of coastal marshlands, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 119-5 and exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Silviculture means the art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees. 
                  Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in section 119-7. 
                  Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 
                  Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps. 
                  Wetland protection district means wetlands within the city which are indicated on the generalized wetland map. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this chapter does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-601) 
                  Sec. 119-3. - Relationship to zoning. 
                  The wetland protection district shall comprise an overlay zone that supplements and is indicated on the city's zoning map. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-602) 
                  Sec. 119-4. - Local development permit requirements. 
                  (a)  No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the city council or its designee in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in section 119-5 shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 200 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the city or authorized designee using the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
                  (b)  No local government action under this chapter relieves the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. Further, no local permit or permission will be granted for a proposed development project that appears to contain wetlands or be located near wetlands so as to potentially alter them until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has determined whether jurisdictional wetlands exist on the site. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-603)

                  (1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual Section 404 permit. 
                  (2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (4)  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  (5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (Code 2003, § 39-604)

                  Sec. 121-2. - Definitions. 
                  Except as otherwise provided herein, all words shall have their customary dictionary meaning. The present tense includes the future tense. The singular number includes the plural and the plural includes the singular. The term "person" includes a firm, corporation, association, organization, trust or partnership. The term "lot" includes "plot" or "parcel." The term "building" includes "structure." The term "shall" is always mandatory. The term "used" or "occupied," as applied to any land or building, shall be construed to include the terms "intended, arranged, or designed to be used or occupied." The term "erected" shall be deemed also to include "constructed," "reconstructed," "altered," "placed," or "moved." The term "land use" and "use of land" shall be deemed also to include "building use" and "use of building." The term "adjacent" means "nearby" and not necessarily "contiguous." The term "map" means the "Official Zoning Map of the City of Greensboro, Georgia," dated May, 2005 and as may be amended. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Accessory building means a subordinate building, the use of which is incidental to, and reasonably related to, a main building on the same lot or to the primary use of the property. The accessory building shall be of a size and nature customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal. Accessory buildings shall include solid roofs such as open air structures such as gazebos and pavilions. Signs and fences are not to be considered as accessory buildings. The term "detached accessory building" shall be one that does not have a common wall or roof connection with the main building on the same lot. 
                  Accessory structure means a structure subordinate to the principal building on a lot which is open in nature, such as a deck, fence, landscape wall, trellis (open roof), swimming pool, or other similar structures. Pools and spas are also considered to be accessory structures for zoning purposes. 
                  Accessory use means a use on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal use. 
                  Adult day care means the provision of a community based non-medical comprehensive plan of services that meets the needs of aging adults; or for the protection of an individual, for less than 24 hours per day. Individuals or organizations providing adult day care services without compensation, or provide services to only one or two participants for compensation, are not licensed by the Georgia Department of Health. Adult day care provided as an accessory use by properly zoned religious institutions, nonprofit institutions, or community centers will be considered by the planning and zoning board and city council as a conditional use regardless of the zoning district. 
                  Adult day center means a facility, licensed by the Georgia Department of Community Health, that, for compensation, provides adult day care under a social model serving three or more aging adults 60 years of age or older or mature adults below the age of 60 whose needs and interests are substantially similar to persons 60 years of age or older who have physical or mental limitations that restrict their abilities to perform the normal activities of daily living and impede independent living. The social model of care addresses primarily the basic social and recreational activities needed to be provided to aging adults, but also provides, as required, limited personal care assistance, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living, psychosocial, and related services to persons demonstrating moderate impairments in functioning and cognition, based on individual plans of care and shall be provided for less than 24 hours per day. 
                  Adult day health center means a facility, licensed by the Georgia Department of Community Health, that, for compensation, provides the services described under adult day center services, and also provides a comprehensive plan of services that meets the needs of three or more aging adults under a medical model. The medical model is a comprehensive program that provides social, rehabilitative, and minor health services to physically and/or mentally functionally impaired elderly adults, for the purpose of restoring or maintaining optimal capacity for self-care. These programs provide services through individual plans of care and target elderly persons who could be at risk of institutional placement if intervention is not provided. Participants in this model of care will have moderate to substantial degrees of impairments in function and cognition. Such programs of care shall be provided for less than 24 hours per day. 
                  Agriculture or agricultural means a parcel used primarily for soil-dependent cultivation of agricultural crop production, the raising of livestock or poultry, growth of a field, or forestry.

                  Sec. 121-62. - Principal buildings. 
                  (a)  In all commercial, industrial, and office-institutional zones, more than one principal building containing a permitted or conditional use may be erected on a single lot or tract of land provided that all yard and other space requirements of this chapter are met for each structure as though it were on an individual lot. In the agricultural zones, more than one principal building housing a permitted single-family residential use may be erected on a single-family residential lot or tract of land provided all yard and other space requirements of this chapter are met for each structure and each building shall be located on a lot or parcel which abuts a public street or road or has access to a public street or road by means of a recorded easement. 
                  (b)  The owner must record a plat of subdivision of the lot with the clerk of the superior court before a building permit can be issued where two or more principal buildings are located on the parcel. A parcel of land divided into three or more lots for sale or legacy may be subjected to the provisions contained in chapter 113.

                  Sec. 121-65. - Annexed property. 
                  All annexed property shall be zoned without further action by the city for the same use for which that property was zoned immediately prior to the annexation. 
                  (Zoning Ord. 2007, § 5.9) 
                  Sec. 121-66. - Interpretation of and determination of uses. 
                  (a)  The City of Greensboro finds that it is impossible to set forth each and every use of land, which may exist now or in the future within the city. The City of Greensboro further finds that it is in the best interests of the city and of its citizens to provide a method of determining permitted or conditional land uses not specifically set out in this chapter. 
                  (b)  If approval is sought for a use not specifically identified or defined within this chapter, the zoning administrator shall consider the requested use to determine whether it is substantially similar to identified uses. For purposes of this section, the term "substantially similar" means that the unidentified use is consistent with and shares the same characteristics as an identified use in terms of nature, of operation, size of operation, impact from operation on adjacent properties and requirements of the use and can reasonably comply with the re-zoning criteria set out in section 121-318(h). 
                  (c)  The zoning administrator shall make an administrative determination that the requested use either is or is not substantially similar to a use specifically identified within this chapter within 20 days from receipt of such requested use and shall submit such determination with his recommendation to the planning commission at the zoning hearing. The planning commission shall make a written determination as to whether the use is "substantially similar" to specified uses in this chapter, specifically stating its reasons therefor, and shall forward its finding along with its recommendation to the city council. The final decision made by the city council shall be kept in the official records of the city so as to ensure consistency of decision-making about heretofore-unidentified uses.

                  Secs. 121-67—121-90. - Reserved. 
                  ARTICLE IV. - GENERAL CONDITIONS 

                  Sec. 121-91. - Nonconforming buildings and uses. 
                  (a)  Generally. 
                  (1)  The elimination of existing buildings and structures or uses that do not conform to this chapter is as much a subject of health, safety and general welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this chapter. It is also the intent of this chapter to administer the elimination of nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights. 
                  (2)  Any structure or use of land lawfully existing at the time of the enactment of this chapter and its amendments, but not in conformity with its use provisions is "grandfathered" and may be continued subject to the following provisions. 
                  (b)  Unsafe structures. Any structure or portion thereof declared unsafe by an appropriate governing authority may be restored to a safe condition, provided the requirements of this section are met. 
                  (c)  Alterations. Any change in a lawfully existing nonconforming building, use, building site or yard area is subject to the following: 
                  (1)  No lawfully existing nonconforming building can be structurally altered, except repairs on the building or installation of plumbing fixtures required by law, the changing of interior partitions, and interior remodeling. Structurally altering a lawfully existing nonconforming building shall not exceed 50 percent of the value of the building as determined by the building inspector. Restorations and remodeling of existing nonconforming agricultural buildings is permitted. 
                  (2)  No lawfully existing nonconforming building or lands, except those residential dwellings needing repairs on the building or installation of plumbing fixtures as required by law, can be substantially added to, moved, or extended in any manner unless such building or land is changed to conform to the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (3)  If a lawfully existing nonconforming building is moved, all nonconforming minimum yard requirements, as defined in article VI of this chapter or elsewhere in this chapter, must be eliminated. 
                  (4)  Whenever an owner of a lawfully existing residential dwelling must make repairs on or installation of plumbing fixtures which will force the location of the future addition of the dwelling nearer the lot line, the addition to the dwelling shall be allowed to extend to the existing building line, but no nearer the property line than any existing portion of the dwelling. 
                  (d)  Extensions. A lawfully existing nonconforming use is restricted to the lot occupied by such use as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. A nonconforming use must not be extended to include either additional building or land, except as permitted in subsection (c)(4) of this section, or unless the owner applies for and is granted a variance. 
                  (e)  Restoration of damaged buildings. Unless otherwise specified, a lawfully existing nonconforming structure that is destroyed (damage equals or exceeds 50 percent of the structures' replacement value, as determined by the building inspector), through no intent of the owner, may not be reconstructed or restored to the same nonconforming use except upon approval of the City of Greensboro Building Inspector. This does not apply to damage due to wind storms, i.e., tornados. 
                  (f)  Discontinuance. A lawfully existing nonconforming use that has been discontinued for a continuous period of, five years shall not be reestablished and any future use shall be in conformance with this chapter. Where government action impedes access to land, the time of any resulting discontinuance of a nonconforming use shall not be counted towards the time periods of this section. 
                  (Zoning Ord. 2007, § 6.1) 
                  Sec. 121-92. - Off-street automobile parking. 
                  (a)  Required. Within the City of Greensboro, off-street automobile storage or parking space shall be provided on every lot on which any permitted or conditional use is established in accordance with this chapter. 
                  (b)  General requirements. For the purpose of this chapter, the following general requirements are specified: 
                  (1)  The term "off-street parking space" means a space at least ten feet wide and 18 feet in length with a minimum net area of 180 square feet. Minimum driving lane requirements for egress and ingress and maneuverability of vehicles in the parking area shall be: 
                  a.  90-degree parking: 24 feet. 
                  b.  60-degree parking: 18 feet. 
                  c.  45-degree parking: 14 feet. 
                  (2)  If an off-street parking space cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, the City of Greensboro Building Inspector may permit such space to be provided on other off-street property, provided such space lies within 600 feet of the property line of the principal use. The parking space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner. 
                  (3)  The required number of parking spaces for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot, but the required space assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use at the same time. 
                  (4)  Area reserved for off-street parking in accordance with the requirements of this chapter shall not be reduced in area or changed to any other use unless the permitted use which it serves is discontinued or modified, and unless equivalent parking space is provided to the satisfaction of the City of Greensboro Building Inspection Office. 
                  (5)  Off-street parking existing at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived in connection with the operation of an existing building or use shall not be reduced to an amount less than hereinafter required for a similar new building or use. 
                  (c)  Parking space requirements for all districts. 
                  (1)  Off-street automobile storage of parking space shall be provided with vehicular access to a street or alley, and shall be equal to the minimum requirements for the specific land use set forth. 

                   
                  (2)  For specific buildings or uses not scheduled in subsection (1) of this section, the administrator shall apply the unit of measurement set forth in the schedule in subsection (1) of this section which is deemed to be the most similar to the proposed building or use, or approve site specific parking based on developer submitted data (subject to administrator approval), or apply an appropriate standard from an accepted reference manual. 
                  (d)  Shared parking. Two or more uses may share parking facilities without providing the minimum number of on-site required spaces for each use, provided the following conditions are met: 
                  (1)  The minimum required number of parking spaces for the combined uses may be reduced by 20 percent where hours of operation overlap with approval of the planning and zoning board. 
                  (2)  Off-site spaces shall be within 600 feet of the property line of the principal use. If the pedestrian access is to cross an arterial street, appropriate safety measures must be present to help the pedestrian cross the street. In any event, safe and convenient pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk or path, must exist or be provided from the structure or use to the parking lot. 
                  (3)  The parking facility to be shared must contain at least the minimum required spaces of the largest individual use sharing the lot and shall be developed to the extent of at least being paved and striped according to the standards of this chapter. 
                  (4)  The parking facility to be shared must be owned by the owner of one of the uses or leased for at least a 20-year term or through a permanent easement by the owner of the uses being served. 
                  (5)  No changes shall be made to the shared parking facility which would reduce the parking provided for the uses, unless the owner of one of the uses makes other arrangements to provide parking. No such changes shall be made without approval of the zoning administrator. 
                  (6)  Parking spaces to be shared must not be reserved for a specific person, individual, or use on a 24-hour basis. 
                  (7)  Handicap parking spaces cannot be shared, unless the establishments that are to share the spaces are adjacent to the handicap spaces and not inconvenient to the users of such spaces. 
                  (8)  Loading space shall not be used for general parking. 
                  (9)  Any proposed change in the use of a structure that shares a parking facility will require proof that adequate parking is available. 
                  (10)  Off-site and shared parking may be used in combination to develop parking facilities, provided all the requirements of this section are met. 
                  (e)  Stacking space for drive-through facilities. 
                  (1)  Stacking spaces shall be provided for any use having a drive-through facility or areas having drop-off and pick-up areas. The following general standards shall apply to all stacking spaces and drive-through facilities: 
                  a.  Stacking spaces and lanes for drive-through stations shall not impede on and off site traffic movements, shall not cross or pass through off-street parking areas, and shall not create a potentially unsafe condition where crossed by pedestrian access to a public entrance of a building. 
                  b.  Drive-through lanes shall be separated from off-street parking areas. Individual lanes shall be striped, marked or otherwise distinctly delineated. 
                  c.  Approach lanes for drive-through facilities shall have the following minimum widths: 
                  1.  One lane: 12 feet per lane. 
                  2.  Two or more lanes: Ten feet per lane. 
                  d.  All drive-through facilities shall be provided with a bypass lane with a minimum width of ten feet. 
                  e.  Alleys or driveways in residentially zoned areas adjacent to drive-through facilities shall not be used for circulation of customer traffic. 
                  f.  Each stacking space shall be a minimum of ten feet by 20 feet. 
                  (2)  The number of stacking spaces shall be provided as follows: 
                  a.  Financial institutions with drive-through windows: Two stacking spaces for each window. 
                  b.  Drive-in or fast food restaurant: Six stacking spaces per drive-through window measured from the order board or station. 
                  c.  All other uses: Three stacking spaces for each window. 
                  (f)  Parking area site requirements. All off-street parking shall be laid out, constructed, and maintained according to the following requirements for B1, B2, C3, L1, OI and CPUD. Off-street parking includes parking spaces or lots for customers and employees. 
                  (1)  All parking areas shall be hard surfaces with concrete or plant mix material. Parking areas may consist of gravel or crusher-run with the approval of the planning and zoning board. Parking areas without hard surfaces shall install parking blocks each perpendicular or diagonal parking space except where the parking space is adjacent to concrete curbs. 
                  (2)  Lighting facilities, if provided, shall be arranged so that light is reflected away from adjacent properties and streets. 
                  (3)  The parking area shall be adequately drained. 
                  (4)  No sign shall be placed within the public right-of-way. Signs and planting strips shall not obstruct the visibility of drivers or pedestrians. 
                  (5)  All parking lots must be maintained in a clean, litter-free condition. 
                  (g)  Landscape standards for parking lots. 
                  (1)  Parking lots should be effectively landscaped with trees and shrubs to reduce the visual impact of glare, headlights, and parking lot lights from the public right-of-way and from adjoining properties. In addition, parking lots should be adequately shaded to reduce the amount of reflected heat. 
                  a.  When a lot is located adjacent to a public right-of-way, a minimum of ten feet of landscaped land will be provided between the right-of-way and the parking lot to reduce the visual impact of the parking lot. The landscaping site plan must be approved by the zoning administrator. 
                  b.  Along the perimeter of the parking lot, to reduce its visual impact, provide a ten-foot wide landscape strip around the perimeter of the lot, to be planted with shade trees and low shrubs. Provide a minimum of one shade tree per every 40 feet of lot perimeter. However, this does not mean that shade trees must be located 40 feet on center. Additional shade trees may be necessary to effectively shade/screen the parking lot. 
                  c.  For the purpose of calculating off-street parking lot square footage, all areas within the lot's perimeter are counted, including the planting islands, curbed areas, corner lots, parking spaces, and all interior driveways and aisles except those with no parking spaces located on either side. Landscaped areas outside the parking lot may not be used to meet the interior planting requirement. Landscape provisions only apply to parking areas for customers or employees. The amount of landscaping required is based on the following sliding scale: 

                   
                  (2)  The percentages in subsection (g)(1)c of this section must be planted in shade trees. This is necessary to break up the visual expansiveness of lots and to reduce glare and heat. Landscaping requirements will be to plant a minimum of one over story or two under story trees per 200 square feet of required interior planting area. The trees shall meet the following criteria: 
                  a.  Over story trees shall be a minimum of 2½ inches caliper. Over story trees include but are not limited to oaks, pines, and maples. 
                  b.  Under story trees shall be a minimum of one-inch caliper. Under story trees include but are not limited to dogwoods, crepe myrtles, and redbuds. 
                  c.  No more than one-third of the trees can be under story trees. 
                  d.  No more than 50 percent of the trees can be of a single variety. 
                  (3)  To achieve these objectives, the following alternatives should be considered: 
                  a.  Provide a continuous landscape strip between every four rows of parking. This should be a minimum of eight feet in width to accommodate a low hedge and over story trees. 
                  b.  Create large planting islands (over 600 square feet) to be located throughout the lot and planted with shade trees, low shrubs, and/or ground over. These should preferably be located at the ends of parking rows. 
                  c.  Provide planting islands (a minimum of nine feet wide) between every ten to 15 spaces to avoid long rows of parked cars. Each of these planting islands should provide at least one shade tree having a clear trunk height of at least six feet. 
                  (4)  Within the interior of the parking lot, landscaping should be used to delineate vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns. Clear and legible signs, different color and texture paving materials, raised areas, and other techniques should be used to further direct the flow of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic within the lot. 
                  (5)  The general guidelines listed in this subsection should be followed for all parking lots. 
                  a.  Use shade trees with ground cover of low shrubs as the primary landscape material within parking lots. Avoid tall shrubs or low branching trees that will restrict visibility. 
                  b.  For planting islands that are parallel to spaces, islands should be a minimum of nine feet wide to allow doors to open. 
                  c.  For planting islands that are perpendicular to spaces, islands should be a minimum of eight feet wide to allow for overhang of parked cars. If parking is only on one side of the island, an eight-foot width is still required. 
                  d.  Screening of mechanical equipment, trash, and loading areas should be provided. This can be achieved using walls, fences, and/or landscaping. 
                  e.  Where appropriate, the use of porous pavement and/or specially designed brick or block should be considered to increase on site water retention for plant material and groundwater supplies and to reduce problems associated with runoff. 
                  (h)  Maintenance of perimeter and interior parking lot landscaping. The owner, tenant, and their agent, if any, are jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. All landscaped areas must be watered via underground sprinkler systems or be provided with a readily available water supply with at least one outlet located within 150 feet of all plant material to be maintained. 
                  (1)  All plant growth in landscaped areas must be controlled by pruning, trimming, or other suitable methods so that plant materials do not interfere with public utilities, restrict pedestrian or vehicular access, or otherwise constitute a traffic hazard. 
                  (2)  All planted areas must be maintained in a relatively weed free condition and clear of undergrowth. 
                  (3)  All planting must be fertilized and irrigated at such intervals as necessary to promote optimum growth. 
                  (4)  All trees, shrubs, ground cover, and other plant materials must be replaced during the next suitable planting period if they die or become unhealthy because of accidents, drainage problems, disease, or other causes. 
                  (5)  Replacement plants must conform to all standards that govern the original installation of plantings.

                  Sec. 121-93. - Off-street loading and unloading space. 
                  (a)  Generally. Off-street loading and unloading spaces shall be provided as required by this section. 
                  (b)  Size of off-street loading spaces. Each off-street loading space shall have minimum dimensions of 14 feet in height, 12 feet in width, and 55 feet in length. However, upon sufficient demonstration that a particular loading space will be used exclusively by shorter trucks, the zoning administrator may reduce the minimum length accordingly to as little as 35 feet. 
                  (c)  Connection to street or alley. Each required off-street loading space shall have direct access to a street or alley or have a driveway which offers satisfactory ingress and egress for trucks. 
                  (d)  Floor area over 10,000 square feet. Sufficient space for off-street loading and unloading must be provided for each hospital, institution, hotel, commercial or industrial building or similar use requiring the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise, and having a floor area of more than 10,000 square feet of floor space. Such space must be located so as not to hinder the free movement of pedestrians and vehicles over a sidewalk, street or alley. 
                  (e)  Floor area less than 10,000 square feet. Sufficient off-street loading space (not necessarily a full space if shared by adjacent establishments) must be provided for each commercial or industrial building requiring the receipt or distribution of materials for merchandise and having a floor area of less than 10,000 square feet. The space must be located so as not to hinder the free movement of pedestrians and vehicles over a sidewalk, street or alley. 
                  (f)  Bus and trucking terminals. There shall be provided sufficient space to accommodate the maximum number of buses or trucks to be stored or loaded at the terminal at any one time. 
                  (g)  Location of off-street loading spaces. All required off-street loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building which they are intended to serve or on an adjacent lot when the loading spaces are shared with the use occupying said adjacent lot. 
                  (h)  Permanent reservation. Area reserved for off-street loading in accordance with this section must not be reduced or changed to any other use unless the permitted use that the off-street loading serves is discontinued or modified. However, equivalent loading space may be provided and approved by the zoning administrator. 
                  (Zoning Ord. 2007, § 6.3) 
                  Sec. 121-94. - Control of curb cuts and vision clearance. 
                  The requirements for controlling curb cuts and maintaining vision clearance shall be as follows:

                  (1)  The PUD Planned Unit Development District provides for innovative concepts in large-scale residential development that enables economy in capital maintenance, yet does not forsake the desired rural setting of openness and a livable environment. Allied uses, public facilities and enclosed recreational uses are allowed. Through the planned unit development process, it is the intent that property will be developed with a unified design providing continuity between the various elements. However, the PUD process is not intended as a device to circumvent general development regulations, densities, standards and good planning practice. 
                  (2)  At the time of development, all submissions of development plans for any for any PUD must meet all requirements of section 121-201.

                  (3)  PUD densities may be determined on the basis of any and all of the following considerations: the densities designated by the land use plan, the densities of surrounding development, the densities allowed under the various zoning districts, topography and character of the natural environment and the impact of a given density on the specific site and adjacent properties. The City of Greensboro also has the discretion to consider any other relevant factors. In no event shall densities exceed those set out in section 121-201(b). 
                  (4)  There shall be no minimum standards for lot size although existing standards of zoning and subdivisions may be used as a guide.

                  (Zoning Ord. 2007, § 7.13) 
                  Sec. 121-136. - CO Corridor Overlay District. 
                  (a)  Intent. This CO district is intended to serve as an overlay zoning district to provide for enhanced development standards along South Main Street/Highway 44 South, Highway 278, and Highway 15 within the city limits, and such other areas as may be added from time to time. Said overlay is not intended to supplant any existing zoning. It is and shall act as an overlay of additional requirements and restrictions above and beyond the existing underlying zoning designations. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The CO district serves to protect and enhance the significant scenic, natural, and visual assets of community gateways and corridors. These entry areas have a direct impact on places, districts, sites, buildings, structures, and works of art with special historic, cultural, or aesthetic interests or values. The development along such corridors affects Greensboro's small town character, its traditional development pattern, and its cultural heritage and tourism economy. 
                  Suburban sprawl and roadside commercial developments, when set into a traditional, historic community such as Greensboro, produce a devastating effect on town character and quality of life. Often conventional development patterns produce linear development, asphalt wastelands, harsh and glaring light levels, and a proliferation of billboards and other distracting signage and visual clutter. Inadequately planned and regulated strip development has also spawned traffic congestion, competing signage and incompatible architecture. In order to preserve Greensboro's rural ambiance and historic nature, guidance is necessary to prevent the emergence and expansion of continuous strips of incompatible development in these corridors. 
                  The primary goal is to protect and improve the character of these gateways and corridors while directing future development in harmony with the unique status of Greensboro. Careful planning, particularly along heavily traveled and developed corridors, can allow new developments to successfully complement the existing town without compromising its unique character. The purpose of this district is to utilize appropriate, innovative regulations and planning techniques to protect Greensboro's gateways and corridors. 
                  The objectives also include the safe and efficient use of the roadway and roadway frontage, the use of cooperative planning measures and shared amenities to integrate and connect adjoining development, and the encouragement of quality, sensible development in harmony with the historic character of Greensboro. A further purpose is the visual reclamation of existing linear shopping centers and the extensive asphalt parking lots associated therewith. The city also seeks to enhance open space conservation. 
                  This district emphasizes the compatibility of building form, scale, massing and materials such that new structures will conform to neighboring community features and the traditional development pattern, and more closely respect the historic character of the town. New uses and structures should be reflective of and harmonious with existing traditional buildings in Greensboro and its rural surroundings. The construction of new, smaller scale traditional buildings along the roadside frontage and its viewshed can integrate with and contribute to the community in a positive manner. 
                  (c)  Permitted uses. 
                  (1)  The CO districts are superimposed over existing zoning districts. The special requirements of the CO district shall apply in addition to the requirements of the zoning district within which a specific property is located. Uses permitted within the CO district are those permitted in the underlying zoning district. The CO district is solely for the purpose of providing enhanced development and standards for modification and expansion of existing building/sites and new development within the defined area of the corridor. If there is any conflict between the CO district and the underlying zoning district, the more stringent requirement shall govern. 
                  (2)  The standards set out herein shall apply to all new development or any modifications or expansions of existing developments within zoning districts designated as R2, R3, C3, RM, B1, B2, OI, LI, HI, CPUD, or PUD only. The standards set out herein shall not apply to any R-1 district and no use in any district existing as of the effective date of this ordinance shall be required to comply with the requirements herein except upon a modification or expansion of the use existing at the time of application. 
                  (d)  Certificate of appropriateness. Within the CO district, no material change in appearance based on modification or expansion of an existing building or lot or new development shall be made and no building permit shall be issued unless a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) has been approved by the Greensboro Architectural Approval Board (GAAB), as established in section 121-291. All construction shall conform to the COA. An approved COA shall become void unless construction is commenced within six months of date of issuance. A COA shall be valid for 18 months, at which time it shall expire. A new application must be submitted and a new COA issued by the GAAB prior to any construction or modification after expiration of a COA. Work not in compliance with a COA is prohibited. 
                  (e)  Certificate of appropriateness application process. 
                  (1)  An application for a COA, for either preliminary review or final review, shall be accompanied by such drawings, photographs, or plans as required by the commission and shall be submitted to the zoning and planning official at least 30 days prior to the GAAB's regularly scheduled meeting. 
                  (2)  For new developments and/or new buildings and significant changes to existing development and/or buildings, both preliminary review and final review are required. The GAAB shall review the application and preliminary plans no less than 30 days prior to final review and may suggest revisions that enable the preliminary plan to conform to the GAAB's criteria. 
                  (3)  For minor changes to existing development and/or buildings, only one review is required and applications for such minor changes shall be submitted to the zoning and planning official not less than 15 days prior to the GAAB's regularly scheduled meeting. The zoning and planning official, after consultation with the GAAB chairman, shall determine whether changes to existing development and/or buildings constitute either a minor or significant change. 
                  (4)  Minor changes are: changes in type of roofing material, installation of awnings or signs, removal of non-conforming signs or structures and installation of irrigation, and alterations involving less than $5,000.00 to existing elevations or site plans. 
                  (f)  Notice. A public notice shall be published in the official legal organ of Greene County, Georgia or in a newspaper of general circulation in Greensboro at least 15 days and not more than 45 days prior to the scheduled meeting of the GAAB, stating that the GAAB will hold a hearing and stating the purpose, time, date, and location of the hearing, the location of the property, the present use, and a brief description of the nature of the material change in appearance proposed. Upon the filing of an application for COA, the applicant shall at his expense cause to be erected in a conspicuous place on the subject property, no less than 15 days prior to the scheduled hearing, one or more sign(s) furnished by the city, each of which shall not be less than nine square feet in area, and each of which shall contain the same information required in the newspaper advertisement. No such public hearing shall take place until said sign(s) has been posted for at least 15 days. 
                  (g)  Public hearing. 
                  (1)  The public hearings shall be conducted by the GAAB and shall be governed by this section. Minutes of the meeting will be taken by the zoning and planning official. Copies of any findings, decisions and COA shall be available upon request to interested members of the public. The public hearing shall be called to order by the presiding officer, who shall summarize the requirements as to speakers' conduct and time limits. 
                  (2)  The zoning and planning official shall report on the application, including the following: 
                  (i)  The location of the property, the present use, and a description of the proposed material change in appearance; 
                  (ii)  Any report, investigation, or recommendation of the zoning and planning official; and 
                  (iii)  Any additional information considered by the zoning and planning official to be relevant. 
                  (3)  Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the pending application and shall address his remarks only to the members of the GAAB. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or any discussion irrelevant to the pending application. Speakers shall not duplicate previous comments, as repetition deprives other speakers of valuable time to provide new information. The GAAB chairman or his/her designee shall refuse a speaker the right to continue if the speaker, after once being cautioned, continues to violate any section of this article. 
                  (4)  The applicant or applicant's representative shall present and explain his application after being recognized by the chairperson. The applicant will be allowed not less than ten minutes combined total to make his initial presentation and subsequent rebuttal, but the applicant and all supporters shall have a combined time limit of no more than 15 minutes. 
                  (5)  After the applicant's presentation, interested persons who support the application, after being permitted to speak by the presiding officer, may address the proposed application by standing and stating their name, address, and interest and any comments on the pending application. Persons other than the applicant who support the application are allowed to speak in support of the pending application, subject to the 15 minute combined total time limit. 
                  (6)  Persons opposing an application are allowed not less than ten minutes total as a group (and in no event less than the combined time used by the applicant and other supporters), to address their opposition to the application. The opponents shall have a combined total time limit of no more than 15 minutes. It is suggested that the supporters, and opponents, each obtain one spokesperson to present their views. No individual except the applicant, a group representative, or an attorney shall speak more than one time on an application. 
                  (7)  The applicant shall have an opportunity for brief summary remarks using any reserved time from his initial presentation, after which time the presiding officer shall close the public hearing. The GAAB shall then deliberate and take action on the application. Deliberation may include questions to applicants, supporters and/or opponents. Actions shall be by majority vote. The chairman may vote only in the event of a tie. 
                  (h)  Standards for decision. 
                  (1)  At the conclusion of the public hearing the GAAB shall issue a COA if it finds the proposed change(s) in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the CO District. The GAAB shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the extent to which the proposed project complies with the GAAB's design criteria in terms of the proposed architectural style, general design arrangement, texture and color (non-painted surfaces), material of the architectural features, parking, pavement, and other site features, and the extent to which the proposal is compatible with other structures in the area. The GAAB shall have the authority to adopt and publish design guidelines for the CO district. The GAAB shall not consider interior arrangement, or use having no effect on exterior architectural features, safety or utility. 
                  (2)  The GAAB shall deny a COA if it finds the material change in appearance would have a substantial adverse effect on the CO district. The GAAB shall set forth in writing reasons for the denial, which it shall transmit to the applicant. The GAAB may suggest modifications or alternatives to the proposed alteration or new construction. The applicant may make modifications to the plans and resubmit a new or revised application for consideration by the GAAB. The denial by the GAAB shall be binding upon the building and code official and no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (3)  The GAAB shall approve or deny an application for a COA within 60 days after a fully completed application is filed with the zoning and planning official. Failure of the GAAB to act within said 60 days shall be deemed approval of the application and no other evidence of approval by the GAAB shall be needed. 
                  (i)  Appeals. Any person dissatisfied with a decision of the GAAB may appeal in writing to the Greensboro City Council. The appeal must clearly set forth all alleged errors, and must be filed with the city clerk's office within 30 days after the GAAB's decision is rendered. After a public hearing by the council, the council may approve the decision, or modify or reject the decision, if it finds that the GAAB abused its discretion by acting arbitrarily and/or in violation of constitutional rights in reaching its decision. Appeals from decisions of the Greensboro City Council may be taken to the Superior Court of Greene County, Georgia, and must be filed within 30 days of the council's decision. 
                  (j)  Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be provided for the full width of the parcel frontage abutting any public right-of-way and shall be of a width, depth and specific location as approved by the city engineer and as may be required through the site and architectural review process. The city encourages the development of meandering sidewalks for aesthetic and functional purposes. 
                  (k)  Architectural requirements. Modification, expansion, and new development within the CO district shall require such architectural enhancements that include enhanced materials and building design which would have the purpose and effect of providing increased building and site aesthetic appeal, as well as providing a style and design which are consistent with southern architectural themes in the general vicinity of the city and surrounding areas. The specific building materials and architectural style which are proposed for any development project are subject to review and approval through the site and architectural review process. 
                  (l)  Shared driveways. In order to limit the number of traffic conflict points along the corridor, new development projects will be required to design and install shared driveways with adjacent properties. The specific location of the shared driveways shall be subject to review and approval through the site and architectural review process. Additionally, approval will be required from the State of Georgia Department of Transportation for any driveways, shared or otherwise, which provide access to and from the state highway. 
                  (m)  Landscape standards for parking lots in the CO district: 
                  (1)  Parking lots within the CO district shall be effectively landscaped with trees and shrubs to reduce the visual impact of glare, headlights, and parking lot lights from the public right-of-way and from adjoining properties. In addition, parking lots should be adequately shaded to reduce the amount of reflected heat. 
                  (2)  When a lot is located within the overlay district, a minimum of ten feet of landscaped land will be provided around the perimeter of the parking lot to reduce the visual impact of the parking lot. The landscaping site plan must be approved by the zoning administrator. 
                  (3)  Along the perimeter of the parking lot, to reduce its visual impact: 
                  a.  Provide a ten foot wide landscape strip around the perimeter of the lot, to be planted with shade trees and low shrubs. Provide a minimum of one shade tree per every 40 feet of lot perimeter. However, this does not mean that shade trees must be located 40 feet on center. Additional shade trees may be necessary to effectively shade/screen the parking lot. 
                  b.  In cases where quality woodland exists, preserve a minimum of 25 feet of vegetation along the perimeter of the lot. Provide additional evergreen shrubs if needed. 
                  c.  Landscaped areas outside the parking lot may not be used to meet the interior planting requirement. Landscape provisions only apply to parking areas for customers or employees. A minimum of 15 percent of the gross square footage of the interior of the parking lot shall be landscaped. 
                  d.  The above percentage must be planted in shade trees. This is necessary to break up the visual expansiveness of lots and to reduce glare and heat. Landscaping requirements will be to plant a minimum of one overstory or two understory trees per 200 square feet of required interior planting area. The trees shall be the following criteria: overstory trees shall be a minimum of two and one-half inches caliper; overstory trees include but are not limited to oaks, pines, and maples; understory trees shall be a minimum of one inch caliper; understory trees include but are not limited to dogwoods, crepe myrtles, and redbuds; no more than one-third of the trees can be understory trees; and no more than 50 percent of the trees can be of a single variety. To achieve these objectives, the following alternatives should be considered: a continuous landscape strip between every four rows of parking, a minimum of eight feet in width to accommodate a low hedge and shade trees, create large planting islands (over 600 square feet) to be located throughout the lot and planted with shade trees, low shrubs, and/or ground over, preferably located at the ends of parking rows or provide planting islands (a minimum of nine feet wide) between every ten to 15 spaces to avoid long rows of parked cars, each of these planting islands providing at least one shade tree having a clear trunk height of at least six feet. 
                  e.  A three and one-half feet (42 inches) high screen wall shall be constructed to separate and provide a visual buffer between any off-street parking area and any adjacent public street. Said wall shall be constructed behind the property line abutting the public street and shall extend the full length of the distance where the parking area abuts the public street. The specific material, color and location of any screen wall shall be subject to review and approval through the site and architectural review process. Said screen wall shall be located behind the required ten foot wide landscaping strip referred to in Section 7.14.7.2, supra. 
                  f.  Parking lot lighting shall be provided to ensure security and safety in all off-street parking areas. Lighting fixtures shall be designed such that all light is directed downward from the fixture, thus reducing night sky light pollution. The specific fixture type, height, number and locations throughout the parking area shall be subject to review and approval through the site and architectural review process. 
                  g.  Any tract located adjacent to the CO district which has a parking lot or a plan of development of multiple buildings which includes in total parking lots designed for greater than 50 vehicles, shall require, in addition to the landscaped buffer, an earthen berm which shall shield the parking lot from view. 
                  h.  Any freestanding sign within the CO district shall be limited to pedestal type signs with a total height not to exceed seven feet from average surrounding ground level and a width not to exceed 10 feet. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the mayor and council may make a finding, after review, that the interests of the city and goals of this CO district would be best served by the removal of preexisting nonconforming billboard signs in exchange for the placement of new signs not in compliance herewith. In the event of such a finding, the mayor and council, on a case by case basis, may negotiate with owners of non-conforming, preexisting signs and authorize the placement of new signs not in compliance herewith in exchange for the removal of said nonconforming preexisting signs. 
                  (n)  Maintenance of perimeter and interior parking lot landscaping in the CO district: 
                  (1)  The owner, tenant, and their agent, if any, are jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. All landscaped areas must be watered via an underground sprinkler system or be provided with a readily available water supply with at least one outlet located within 150 feet of all plant material to be maintained. 
                  (2)  All plant growth in landscaped areas must be controlled by pruning, trimming, or other suitable methods so that plant materials do not interfere with public utilities, restrict pedestrian or vehicular access, or otherwise constitute a traffic hazard. 
                  (3)  All planted areas must be maintained in a relatively weed free condition and clear of undergrowth. 
                  (4)  All planting must be fertilized and irrigated at such intervals as necessary to promote optimum growth. 
                  (5)  All trees, shrubs, ground cover, and other plant materials must be replaced during the next suitable planting period if they die or become unhealthy because of accidents, drainage problems, disease, or other causes. 
                  (6)  Replacement plants must conform to all standards that govern the original installation of plantings. 
                  (o)  Location. 
                  (1)  South Main Street/Highway 44. The entire length of the right-of-way of South Main Street/Highway 44, within the city limits of Greensboro, beginning at the intersection of South Main Street and Broad Street and running South to the intersection with South Main Street/Highway 44 and the southerly city limit line as the same may exist from time to time.

                  Sec. 121-231. - Procedures. 
                  (a)  The zoning administrator shall prepare information regarding the petition for consideration by the planning commission at its regularly scheduled meeting. 
                  (b)  The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed use in accordance with the notice and hearing provisions for zoning amendment. The planning commission shall then review the inspector's report and conduct a comprehensive review of the proposed use and forward a recommendation to the City of Greensboro. Said recommendation may be to approve, approve with condition, or deny the request. 
                  (c)  The city council shall issue its findings within 40 days of the receipt of the planning commission recommendation. The city council may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the request.

                  (2)  Vehicular traffic and pedestrian movement on adjacent streets will not be substantially hindered or endangered; 
                  (3)  Off-street parking and loading, and the entrance to and exit from such parking and loading, will be adequate in terms of location, amount and design to service the use; 
                  (4)  Public facilities and utilities are capable of adequately serving the proposed use; 
                  (5)  Granting the request would not be an illogical extension of a use which would intrude a damaging volume of agricultural, commercial, industrial, or high density apartment use into a stable neighborhood of well maintained single-family homes, and likely lead to decreasing surrounding property values, neighborhood deterioration, spreading of blight, and additional requests of a similar nature which would expand the problem; 
                  (6)  Granting the request would not lead to congestion, noise and traffic hazards or overload public facilities current or planned; 
                  (7)  Granting this request would conform to the general expectations for the area population growth and distribution according to the comprehensive land use plan; 
                  (8)  Granting this request would not lead to a major negative change in existing levels of public service, government employees or fiscal stability; and 
                  (9)  Granting this request would not have a "domino effect," in that it becomes the opening wedge for further rapid growth, urbanization or other land use change beyond what is indicated in the comprehensive land use plan. 
                  (10)  Variances. 
                  a.  A variance may be authorized for specific individual cases where the literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship as long as the variance, if granted, is not contrary to the public interest, and public safety and welfare remain secured. 
                  b.  Variances may be granted in such individual cases of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship only upon a finding by the planning and zoning board that all of the following conditions exist: 
                  1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography; 
                  2.  The application of this section to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  3.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter; and 
                  4.  The special circumstances surrounding the request for a variance are not the result of known acts by the applicant. 
                  (11)  Unless otherwise noted, the site plan submitted in support of an approved conditional use or variance shall be considered part of the approval and must be followed. 
                  (12)  Approval of a proposed use by planning and zoning board of the City of Greensboro does not constitute an approval for future expansion of or additions or changes to the initially approved operation. Any future phases or changes that are considered significant by the City of Greensboro and not included in the original approval are subject to the provisions of this article and the review of new detailed plans and reports for said alterations by the governing authority. All uses, construction or building approved in the conditional use must begin within 60 days of approval of the city council and be fully completed within one year of approval.

The zoning administrator is the zoning enforcement officer. Any person who would be damaged by such violation may also institute action to prevent or abate the violation.

                  Sec. 121-289. - Developments of regional impact (DRI). 
                  (a)  The Georgia Planning Act of 1989 authorized the department of community affairs to establish procedures for regional review of development projects that are of sufficient size that they are likely to create impacts beyond the jurisdiction in which the project will be located. The developments of regional impact (DRI) review process involves the host local government, the reviewing regional development center (RDC), and other potentially affected local governments, RDCs and agencies. 
                  (b)  Thresholds are used to determine whether a proposed development is a DRI. Because positive and negative impacts of DRIs are not necessarily confined to the host local governments' jurisdictional boundaries, impacts on other jurisdictions need to be assessed. 
                  (c)  If a development project is submitted to the City of Greensboro planning commission or the city council for review, then the time deadlines are suspended until the DRI review process is completed.

                  Any person or persons, jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision (including the failure to decide within 30 days upon submission of all documents required by this chapter) of the building inspector, shall have the right of appeal in writing to the city clerk for the purpose of a hearing by the city attorney for an interpretation of pertinent ordinance provisions. In exercising the power of interpretation, the city attorney may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the building inspector. 
                  (1)  Public hearings. The city attorney shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matters referred to it, and give public notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in Greene County, at least 15 and no more than 45 days before the hearing. Upon a hearing, all parties shall appear in person, by agent or by attorney. 
                  (2)  Appeal from the city attorney's decision. Any person or persons, jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the city attorney may appeal to a court of record as provided by law, if such appeal is filed with the clerk of the court within 30 days of the rendering of the decision by the city attorney. 
                  (3)  Stay of proceedings. An appeal to the court of record stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the building inspector certifies to the city attorney after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property.

                  (a)  Creation of the architectural approval board. The title of the board shall be the "Greensboro Architectural Approval Board." Board members shall be appointed by the mayor and council, and will have authority in guiding design restrictions and development. 
                  (b)  Board position within the City of Greensboro government. The Greensboro Architectural Approval Board shall be considered a part of the planning functions of the City of Greensboro. 
                  (c)  Statement of the board's powers. The Greensboro Architectural Approval Board shall be authorized to: 
                  (1)  Review applications for building or development permits, and recommend same in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the procedures related thereto. 
                  (2)  Recommend to the local governing body specific actions to preserve and improve the integrity, aesthetics and safety of the CO and OR districts or such other districts as may be added to or become subject to review by the board, from time to time. 
                  (3)  Review applications for building or development permits, and recommend same in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the procedures related thereto. 
                  (d)  Board's power to adopt rules of procedure. The board may adopt rules for the transaction of its business and consideration of applications provided the same are in compliance with state and local law; shall provide for the time and place of regular meetings, and for the calling of special meetings.

                  a.  What is the existing land use pattern in the area? 
                  b.  Would approval create an isolated district designation unrelated to adjacent and nearby district designations?

                  h.  Will the proposed change seriously reduce light and air to adjacent areas? 
                  i.  Will the proposed change adversely affect property values in the adjacent area? 
                  j.  Will the proposed change be a deterrent to the improvement or development adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations? 
                  k.  Will the proposed change constitute a grant of special privilege to an individual owner as contrasted with the public welfare? 
                  l.  Are the substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with its existing zoning? 
                  m.  Is the proposed change out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or the City of Greensboro?

                  (2)  If, because of circumstances peculiar to the location of the property to be posted, the sign will either be inconspicuous or invisible from any well-traveled right-of-way, the sign shall be posted on the property to be rezoned and on other property in such a location that it is likely to be seen by persons potentially interested in the decision. 
                  (e)  Notice to adjacent property owners . At least 15 but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the public hearing, the zoning administrator shall notify all persons owning property within a radius of 300 feet of the property to be affected.

If the planning commission fails to submit its recommendations within the 30-day period, it is deemed to have recommended approval of the proposed amendment. 
                  (2)  The planning commission must investigate each zoning application and make its recommendations to the city council. Such recommendations shall become part of the official public record relating to the application. 
                  (3)  Withdrawal. 
                  a.  If an application for an amendment to this chapter or the official zoning map is withdrawn in writing by the applicant at any time after the publication of the newspaper notice and posting of the required sign, but prior to the public hearing, then the same property may not be considered for zoning by the planning commission until the expiration of at least 60 days immediately following the withdrawal of the rezoning application. The withdrawal must be in writing and signed by the applicant. 
                  b.  The application will be considered to have been withdrawn if the applicant, his authorized agent or his attorney fails to appear at the planning commission hearing. By withdrawing in this manner, the same property may not be considered for rezoning by the planning commission until the expiration of at least 60 days from the date of the scheduled public hearing for which the applicant failed to appear. 
                  (g)  City council action. The city council shall review the record prepared by the planning commission and vote on the proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance or the zoning map. The city council may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application. Within seven days of its decision, the city council shall notify the applicant. If the city council fails to act on the application within 30 days of its submission to the board, the application is deemed to have been approved. If the zoning ordinance amendment or official comprehensive zoning map amendment is denied by the city council, then the same property may not be considered for rezoning until the expiration of at least one year immediately following the denial of the rezoning by the city council. 
                  (h)  Zoning amendment criteria. 
                  (1)  In the adoption of a zoning ordinance, an amendment to an existing zoning ordinance or amendment to the official comprehensive zoning map, the city council shall consider factors relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morals or general welfare against the right of the individual to the unrestricted use of property and must specifically consider the following factors as they may be relevant to the application: 
                  a.  The existing land use pattern; 
                  b.  The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts;

                  h.  The aesthetic effect of existing and future use of the property as it relates to the surrounding area;

                  k.  The relation that the proposed zoning map amendment bears to the purpose of the overall zoning scheme, with due consideration given to whether or not the proposed change will help carry out the purposes of these zoning regulations; 
                  l.  The consideration of the preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall be considered to carry great weight; 
                  m.  In those instances in which property fronts on a major thoroughfare and also adjoins an established residential neighborhood, the factor of preservation of the residential area shall be considered to carry great weight. 
                  (2)  After hearing evidence at the zoning hearing, the planning commission shall apply the evidence of the zoning amendment criteria in making their decision. It will not be required that the planning commission consider every criteria contained in the standards of review. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the public health safety, morality or general welfare.

                  Sec. A-1. - Joint county municipality land use classification dispute resolution process. 
                  The Board of Commissioners of Greene County, Georgia and the Governing Authority of each of the municipalities within Greene County ("County") have agreed to adopt the following Joint County Municipality Land Use Classification Dispute Resolution Process to resolve land use classification disputes when a county objects to the proposed land use of an area to be annexed into a municipality within the county. The County and Municipalities within the County agree that they currently have a joint commission, the Greene County Planning Commission, serving the County and the municipalities of Greensboro, White Plains, and Woodville which may serve as a mechanism for reviewing land use classifications prior to disputes arising. However, in the event that a potential land use classifications dispute arises when a municipality annexes property that has not been resolved prior to the annexation, the County and the Municipalities have adopted the following dispute resolution process. 
                  (Code 2003, ch. 39, exh. A) 
                  Sec. A-2. - Notice of proposed annexation and proposed land use classification. 
                  1.  When a municipality initiates a legislative annexation or accepts a Petition for Annexation under any statutory method, it will notify the Green County Board of Commissioners in writing of the proposed annexation in the manner required by law pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-36-1 et seq. and will include in the notification any proposed rezoning of the annexed property. 
                  2.  When a rezoning application is filed by a property owner or any other person who is permitted by law to apply for rezoning or when rezoning is proposed by the Municipality of property that has been annexed within 12 months of the effective date of an annexation of the property, the Municipality shall provide the County written notice of the proposed rezoning by certified mail, return receipt requested, within five days of the filing of the application of rezoning or notice of a proposed rezoning by the Municipality. 
                  3.  The Greene County Board of Commissioners shall have 45 days from receipt of the written notice of the proposed rezoning to serve the Municipality with its written objection to the proposed rezoning of the property, by certified mail, return receipt requested. The County shall include in the notification the names of its representatives for a Committee to meet informally to resolve the dispute. If the County does not serve the Municipality with its objection to the proposed rezoning within the 45-day response period, the County shall no longer have a right to object to the proposed rezoning. The 45-day response period is designed to allow the County a sufficient period to refer the matter to the Joint County Municipality Planning Commission or the Greene County Planning Commission, in an effort to resolve the dispute expeditiously. 
                  (Code 2003, ch. 39, exh. A) 
                  Sec. A-3. - Informal negotiation. 
                  In the event the Greene County Planning Commission is not successful in resolving the dispute, in all cases involving annexation by the City of Union Point, or at any time in this process, the City Council of the Municipality and Board of Commissioners of Greene County may appoint a committee to meet to discuss the proposed rezoning informally. Upon receipt of the notification of the County's objection to the rezoning and selection of its representative, the City Council of the Municipality shall have five days to notify the County of its representatives. The Municipality and the County may appoint no more than three representatives to the committee to meet to discuss the issues raised by the County in an effort to reach a solution that is advantageous to both parties. The informal committee meeting shall be scheduled within ten days of the appointment of the committee representatives. 
                  1.  The committee may, by mutual agreement, invite the Northeast Georgia Regional Development Center to assist as a facilitator in the discussions. 
                  2.  The committee may, by mutual agreement, invite other interested parties, such as the affected property owners, to participate in the discussions. 
                  3.  If the committee representatives reach a potential resolution of the dispute, the representatives shall make recommendations to their respective governing bodies that the proposed resolution be accepted and officially adopted. If either of the governing bodies reject the proposed resolution, they shall notify their committee representative to request they begin the formal mediation process. 
                  4.  If the committee representatives determine that they will be unable to reach a potential resolution of the dispute, the representatives shall report that fact to their respective governing bodies and request that they begin the formal mediation process. 
                  (Code 2003, ch. 39, exh. A) 
                  Sec. A-4. - Formal mediation. 
                  Within five days of receipt of the report by the committee that a resolution of the dispute was not reached, a representative of the Municipality and the County shall contact the Northeast Georgia Regional Development Center for assistance in scheduling a formal mediation. 
                  1.  The Northeast Georgia Regional Development Center shall assist the municipality and the County in the selection of a mediator acceptable to both parties. 
                  2.  The cost for the mediation will be borne by each of the parties proportionately to their populations in the most recent decennial census. 
                  3.  The mediation should be scheduled as expeditiously as possible but no later than 30 days from the issuance of the committee report to the Municipality and the County or the rejection of the proposed resolution submitted by the committee by one or both of the governing authorities. 
                  4.  The City Council and the Board of County Commissioners shall appoint no more than three representatives to participate in the mediation. 
                  5.  The Municipality and the County may, by mutual agreement, invite other interested parties, such as the affected property owners, to participate in the mediation discussions, but only the representatives have a vote. 
                  6.  If the representatives reach a proposed agreement, the mediator shall make a report to each of the governing bodies for action. 
                  7.  If the representatives cannot reach a proposed agreement, the mediator will make a report to each of the governing bodies. If the process was initiated in response to a proposed annexation, the annexation will not proceed.
